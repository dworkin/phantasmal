<h1>Who outranks who?</h1>

<p>This page details who outranks whom, and who must obey whom, and what
happens if there's a contradiction.</p>

<h2>The Chain of Command</h2>

<p>Listed in order of highest ranking to lowest ranking.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Site Owner (currently Shentino)</dt> <dd>The person in charge
of the "Phantasmal Test" site, which you are currently reading.</dd>

<dt>Mud Administrator</dt>

<dd>Each mud's top adminstrator.</dd>

<dt>Mud staff</dt>

<dd>Any staff of the mud in question.  Further details are available
with each mud.  It may vary from time to time depending on the needs of
the mud, as well as the qualifications of any applicants and even the
theme of the mud itself.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Other details</h2>

<p>Rules and orders:  A rule or order shall be accorded the same rank as
the person who gave it.  For example, the Big Six has rank of "Site
Owner", because Shentino wrote them.</p>

<p>Vicarious responsibility for orders:  Anyone giving an order shall be
responsible as if he himself were to have obeyed it.  So if an admin
orders you to curse someone out, the admin will have broken both the "Be
Nice" and "Be Clean" rules simply by giving the order.  The order itself
would be invalid.</p>

<p>Superior Supercedence:  In the event of conflict, the order or user
of higher rank shall prevail.</p>

<p>Obedience prerequisite to commanding:  Staff must follow the rules to
be considered staff.  Any order or rule made by a staff member must
itself comply with anything of higher rank to be valid.</p>

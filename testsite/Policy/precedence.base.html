<h2>Other details</h2>

<p>Rules and orders:  A rule or order shall be accorded the same rank as
the person who gave it.  For example, the Big Six has rank of "Site
Owner", because Shentino wrote them.</p>

<p>Vicarious responsibility for orders:  Anyone giving an order shall be
responsible as if he himself were to have obeyed it.</p>

<p>Superior supercedence:  In the event of conflict, the order, rule, or

newest order shall prevail.</p>

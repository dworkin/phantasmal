@@TITLE The Big Six@@

<h2>The Big Six of Rules</h2>

<p>These six rules apply on all muds.  Follow them or suffer the
consequences.</p>

<p>These rules apply to EVERYONE, even senior staff.</p>

<h3>1.  Obey the Law</h3>

<p>There will be no sexual harassment, copyright infringement, fraud,
theft, or other such nefarious activities that violate criminal law at
either the federal, state, or local level of any applicable
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The juristiction in which the server is located is Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada.</p>

<p>Anyone found violating any sort of criminal statute that applies to
the server shall be immediately and permanently banned.</p>

<h3>2.  Obey the Staff</h3>

<p>There are a million things that can disrupt the MUDs that cannot
possibly be listed explicity in any sort of rules.  Therefore, staff
have been entrusted with the duties of keeping order and harmony in the
MUDs.</p>

<p>Details on the particulars of rank, precedence in the event of
conflict, and so on can be found <a href="precedence.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>3.  Be Clean</h3>

<p>Foul language, lewdness, profanity, and the like are not welcome. 
The MUDs are meant for public testing, not private perversion.  Besides,
some kid may stumble in, and we don't want to give any parents cause for
alarm, do we?</p>

<h3>4.  Be Nice</h3>

<p>A healthy attitude is a must when on our systems.  Don't be a jerk,
no matter how bad RL gets.  And do bear in mind that there are REAL
PEOPLE connecting (well, they'd BETTER be real ;)).  In short, "Remember
the human".</p>

<h3>5.  Be Honest</h3>

<p>Nothing screws up the "system" like people lying, deceiving, using
false information, or otherwise being conniving or dishonest.  Trust is
the glue that holds the entire system together, and breaking it cannot
be tolerated.</p>

<h3>6.  No Multiplay</h3>

<p>The usage of more than one account per person, or the usage of an
account by more than one person, is strictly prohibited.</p>

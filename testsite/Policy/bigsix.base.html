@@TITLE The Big Six@@

<h2>The Big Six of Rules</h2>

<p>These six rules apply on all three test muds.  Follow them or suffer
the consequences.</p>

<p>These rules apply to EVERYONE, even senior staff.</p>

<h3>1.  Obey the Law</h3>

<p>There will be no sexual harassment, copyright infringement, fraud,
theft, or other such nefarious activities that violate criminal law at
either the federal, state, or local level of any applicable
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>For sure, US federal law applies.  I don't yet know where the server
is physically located, so I'm not sure which state's laws apply.  For
now, use common sense.</p>

<h3>2.  Obey the Staff</h3>

<p>There are a million things that can disrupt the MUDs that cannot
possibly be listed explicity in any sort of rules.  Therefore, staff
have been entrusted with the duties of keeping order and harmony in the
MUDs.</p>

<p>Details on the particulars of rank, precedence in the event of
conflict, and so on can be found <a href="precedence.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>3.  Be Clean</h3>

<p>Foul language, lewdness, profanity, and the like are not welcome. 
The MUDs are meant for public testing, not private perversion.  Besides,
some kid may stumble in, and we don't want to give any parents cause for
alarm, do we?</p>

<h3>4.  Be Nice</h3>

<p>A healthy attitude is a must when on our systems.  Don't be an
arsehole, no matter how bad RL gets.  And do bear in mind that there are
REAL PEOPLE connecting (well, they'd BETTER be real ;)).  In short,
"Remember the human".</p>

<h3>5.  Be Honest</h3>

<p>Nothing screws up the "system" like people lying, deceiving, using
false information, or otherwise being conniving or dishonest.  Trust is
the glue that holds the entire system together, and breaking it cannot
be tolerated.</p>

<p>This includes, but is not limited to, using false information during
registration, fabricating evidence in a harassment case, and the like. 
Just be truthful.</p>

<p>This also includes slyly botting or macroing.  Botting and macroing,
which are generally frowned upon, are especially forbidden if done
secretly.  It is effectively a breach of your claim that you are
entirely human, a claim that you will make when you pass the
captcha.</p>

<h3>6.  No Multiplay</h3>

<p>The usage of more than one account per person, or the usage of an
account by more than one person, is strictly prohibited.  Keeping people
accountable for their actions (either good or bad) requires clear
association between an account and a person.</p>

<p>Any person who shall use more than one account, or who shall
knowingly and willfully permit any other person to use any of their
accounts with anyone else, shall be guilty of multiplay.  Any account
whose user is guilty of multiplay will be terminated.</p>

<p>Some accounts may be for purposes rather than people.  These
exceptions will be noted in advance.</p>

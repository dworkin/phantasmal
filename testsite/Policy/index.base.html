<h1>Policies, Rules, and Regulations</h1>

<p>Since this site is for actual, live, testing, and not just looking
at, there will be some rules for usage of the test site.  Each MUD may
itself have its own policies.  If so, they will be visible.</p>

<p><a href="bigsix.html">The Big Six</a>, a set of six rules that apply
globally, should be first reference.  They apply to everyone, from the
lowliest of guests to the loftiest of senior staff and perhaps even
beyond.</p>

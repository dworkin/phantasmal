<p>(Mud is currently: UP)</p>

<p>Welcome to the Seas of Night Test MUD</p>

<p>Currently, this mud is setup with the basic "mudlib" folder from the
phantasmal project.  You will see the campus of Miskatonic University,
for now.  Pirate themed stuff will come later, once I learn how to use
the builder tools.</p>

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>Please read the policy helpfile by typing in "help policy" once you log in.</p>

<h3>Bug reporting, downtime</h3>

<p>Since this is a test server, it may go down without warning.  Please
contact shentino@gmail.com if you find that the mud is down for more
than 48 hours, and there is no notice on this page about the outage.</p>

<p>However, if there is information about why it's down, or it's marked
as being down, please do not bother me.  If it goes down with proper
notice here, then it was taken down on purpose and will be brought back
up ASAP as time permits.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers of uptime, integrity, etc</h2>

<p>The mud adminstration, server operators, and all other staff,
expressly disclaim any and all warranties with regards to uptime, data
or account integrity, or other performance issues.</p>

<p>This server is primarily for testing purposes and thus the
administration reserves the right to reboot, reinitialize, purge, or
otherwise change or erase any information at their convenience.  While
we will do our best to avoid gratuitous wipes, we cannot make any
promises.</p>

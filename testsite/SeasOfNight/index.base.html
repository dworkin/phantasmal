<p>(Mud is currently: UP)</p>

<p>Welcome to the Seas of Night Test MUD</p>

<p>Currently, this mud is setup with the basic "mudlib" folder from the
phantasmal project.  You will see the campus of Miskatonic University,
for now.  Pirate themed stuff will come later, once I learn how to use
the builder tools.</p>

<h3>Policies</h3>

<p>Please read the policy helpfile by typing in "help policy" once you log in.</p>

<h3>Bug reporting, downtime</h3>

<p>Since this is a test server, it may go down without warning.  Please
contact shentino@gmail.com if you find that the mud is down for more
than 48 hours, and there is no notice on this page about the outage.</p>

<p>However, if there is information about why it's down, or it's marked
as being down, please do not bother me.  If it goes down with proper
notice here, then it was taken down on purpose and will be brought back
up ASAP as time permits.</p>

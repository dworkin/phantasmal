                       Phantasmal MUDLib for DGD

(Important: See "Shentino's Addendum" at the bottom of this file)

To get non-Bundled Phantasmal running, please read the INSTALL file
and follow the instructions you find there.  To start customizing a
Phantasmal-based MUD, please check "http://phantasmal.sf.net/Setup".
Before you make significant code changes to Phantasmal's internal
components, please read doc/Modifying, and preferably most of
Phantasmal's web documentation.  Yes, there's a lot, but it's quite
useful and valuable, and most of it is accurate.

For a listing of Phantasmal's current features, check out
"http://phantasmal.sf.net/Current.html".  For how it compares to other
MUDlibs, check out "http://phantasmal.sf.net/Comparison.html".

Phantasmal is a Kernel-based MUDLib.  It tries to be reasonably fast
and secure, but prefers robustness to speed.  The primary focus is on
features you don't find in every MUD library, especially things you
*should* find in more of them.

The latest information, features, code and tutorials can be located at
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net".



                         Themed MUDs

Phantasmal has separated itself out from the theme and interface of
games built using it.  This makes it more similar to a driver than to
fantasy MUDLibs like Lima, 2.4.5 or GurbaLib.  Phantasmal acts as a
kind of standard library for MUDs while being substantially higher
level than the Kernel Library.  Phantasmal hopes to be a standard
library for rooms, scripts, events, mobiles and so on.  However, the
details of command names, MUD theme and building, and mobile AI are
left to the individual MUDs using Phantasmal.

There is a Phantasmal-based themed MUD called "Seas of Night" which is
used for testing, and illustrates how a Phantasmal-based MUD might be
constructed.  It's available by CVS from Phantasmal's repository
(module 'testgame') or as part of the bundled distribution.

Shentino's Addendum

In spirit with angelbob's wish to keep it free, I have claimed copyright
of Phantasmal, and licensed it to everyone under the terms of the GNU
Affero General Public License, version 3.

Please see the file COPYING for the full text of the license.

Copy your Kernel MUDLib code to mud/kernel.  There should be directories
called data, lib, obj, and sys.  If you want, and if your system
supports it, you can symlink rather than copying.  Be careful, doing so
has been known to cause problems in upgrading (see PROBLEMS file).

Replace the files in include/kernel with the ones in the include/kernel
directory from DGD's Kernel MUDLib.  As of DGD version 1.2.93, the files
are named access.h, kernel.h, objreg.h, rsrc.h, tls.h, user.h, and
version.h. However, you should use whatever versions are found in the
mud/include/kernel directory of the DGD Kernel MUDLib for your current
version of DGD.

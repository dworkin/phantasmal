*** Nouns:

  Describe what articles are allowable -- there is no "a King James", only
"King James" or "the King James".  General a/the/one/some/any parsing.

  look at the King James
  look at King James
  look at a King James <- Wrong?

  take a wooden shoe
  take the wooden shoe
  slyly take any wooden shoe


*** Verbs:

  Lists of allowable adverbs, esp for socials?  Or each adverb inherits
from an adverb category i.e. the verb can deal with all "happy" words
at once?

   smile happily
   smile cheerily
   smile bubblily
   smile with vigor
   smile with good cheer
   smile with good humor

   grumpily smile
   wanly smile
   thinly smile

*** Verbs, Non-2nd person:

  tell mortimer that I should be the one to sink
  tell mortimer that Bob already sank
  tell mortimer the ship sunk
  tell mortimer he'd be a captain by now if he were brave and bold

  A verb object should be able to link (as a word) to other tenses/forms
of the verb, probably including multiword.  For instance:

stand ----> will stand
        |-> stands
        |-> is standing
        |-> are standing
        |-> stood
        |-> has stood
        |-> standing (gerund)


*** Adverbs:

  Break the verb-first parsing order.  Keep a list, and keep track of
them but keep parsing 'til we hit a verb?


*** Weird sentence forms:

  stop looking for contraband
  don't look down
  you should avoid the place the monks are standing

*** Conditionals:

  If Sam is looking for contraband, run.
  If he runs at me, flee.
  When the man turns toward me, look away.
  By the time the bandit has stood up, run away.

  This would require many verb tenses, and probably need to be hooked
into the word graphs.

*** Archetypal sentences:

  With a sufficiently general sentence-parsing facility, the following
can all be parsed basically identically:

  stand on your head
  if you're standing on your head, stop
  If the monks are standing on their heads, jump
  Is aemilia standing on her head?
  When aemilia stands on her head, jump.


*** Overall Structure

    overall:    | subject (opt, may be implied) | predicate         |

    predicate:  | verb  | direct and/or indirect objects            |

  A noun phrase may be followed by a descriptive clause:
    My sister, the girl up there on the stump, said "Yes."
    My sister, who is quite silly, said "Yes."
    My sister, the oldest, said "Yes."

  A verb may be followed by a descriptive phrase:

    She runs over the sink
    She runs around the tree
    She runs like the wind
    She runs with a will
    She runs avidly

  Either may be followed by a prepositional phrase:

    She runs into the tree  (note -- two meanings, two parses)
    The hamster took the bread over the rainbow
    The stars in the sky looked down

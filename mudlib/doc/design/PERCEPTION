It's important to be able to tag descriptions with a perception value,
and to have a heirarchy of what is seen based on perceptual acuity and
skill values.  For instance, a vase might appear to be nothing
(invisible, it's dark, etc), a vague shape (very dark, very far away),
a vase (decent light and no knowledge skill or poor light and some
knowledge), a beautiful and valuable vase (decent light, some
knowledge skill), a valuable old Chinese vase (good light, decent
knowledge), or a tremendously valuable Ming-dynasty vase.

It's important to be able to have separate perception for sight,
sound, smell, etc.  That way an invisible rose still smells of roses,
a motor inside a box still makes noise, a far-away shadowy figure can
still shout clearly (and perhaps have its voice recognized), and so
on.

                 Phantasmal and Network Connections

Phantasmal aims to be compatible with plain-vanilla DGD.  Currently
that means having only a single incoming text port and a single
incoming binary port.  It presently allows the binary port to continue
using the old Kernel MUDLib code in order to allow backdoor login and
repair.

DGD never plans to support outgoing network connections, and so
neither does Phantasmal.  However, Dworkin has announced that he plans
to support larger numbers of incoming ports in the future.  If this
includes an increased number of binary ports then Phantasmal will add
a MUDClient port for use with a specific Phantasmal MUDClient
(currently a plugin to Papaya).  Additional ports such as HTTP or FTP
are possible, but not in short-term plans by any means.  InterMUD3
protocol is reasonably likely.

The practice of having a second incoming port specifically for
creators is interesting, and it will be considered.  It isn't in
Phantasmal's current plans, though.

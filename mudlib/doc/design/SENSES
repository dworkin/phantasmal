You can have perceptible but invisible objects in a room.  For
instance, if a haze in the air is a perfectly good room detail (it is)
then a buzzing sound or a smell of smoke is as well.  "Look" may not
show them, but "listen" or "smell" might.

It's important to be able to combine perception information for sight,
sound, smell and whatnot.  The same object can be a rose and smell
like a rose, and somebody with poor sight or smell can notice one but
not the other.  Similarly, a rose should still smell just fine in the
dark.

It'd be nice to have smells and other "tagged" extra room values
combine in funky scriptable ways with the room.  For instance, a smell
that says things like "the scent of roses wafts through the room"
might not be displayed if there are already visible roses in the room.
In that case, of *course* the smell wafts through.  You'd only want to
comment if it didn't :-)

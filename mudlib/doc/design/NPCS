Need to implement keyword-based conversation system for basic use prior to
anything more complex.

Keyword-Based Conversation (KBC) must be overridable at multiple levels of
inheritance so there can be separate levels for "anybody", "human",
"pirate", "pirate on Dark Lady", and "Roger the Cabin Boy", each with its
own separate conversation pieces.

Need basic pathfinding.

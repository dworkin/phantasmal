Eventual requirements for exits collectively:

- Must be possible to identify "other side" of exits -- delete both halves
  of a two-way exit at once.

- Must be possible to have doors, locks, scripts run when creatures use
  the exit and other nontrivial complexity.

- Should be possible to have any object -- details, random objects -- be
  an exit?

How to Deal with Some Common Problems

Q: I try to run DGD, but I get things that look like this:

     Error within runtime_error:
     Compilation within compilation
     Compilation within compilation
     Config error: initialization failed

A: You probably haven't linked or copied an appropriate Kernel MUDLib
into the Kernel subdirectory of your installation of Phantasmal.  Make
sure that's done and try again.


Q: I try to run DGD, but I get things that look like this:

     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 1: cannot include "kernel/kernel.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 2: cannot include "kernel/objreg.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 3: cannot include "kernel/rsrc.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 4: cannot include "kernel/access.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 5: cannot include "kernel/user.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 6: cannot include "kernel/tls.h"
     Error within runtime_error:
     Compilation within compilation
     Compilation within compilation
     Config error: initialization failed

A: You copied the Kernel MUDLib into the right place, but forgot to
put its headers into the include/kernel directory.  Make sure that's
done correctly and try again.



Q: I run DGD and things look good except that there's no game.  What gives?

A: This is a MUD server.  You'll need to connect to it with a telnet
client on an appropriate port.  If you're unfamiliar with how the
whole process works, you may find you're more comfortable trying out
CircleMUD or another fully developed MUD before trying DGD and
Phantasmal, which are definitely intended for the experienced crowd.

How to Deal with Some Common Installation Problems


Most of the problems in here are because you didn't follow the
instructions in INSTALL incorrectly -- or you didn't follow them at
all.  Have you followed the instructions in INSTALL, and followed them
carefully and correctly?



Q: I try to run DGD, but I get things that look like this:

     Error within runtime_error:
     Compilation within compilation
     Compilation within compilation
     Config error: initialization failed

A: You probably haven't copied the Kernel Library into the kernel
directory of Phantasmal.  Make sure that's done and try again.  For
specifics, check the README in the kernel directory.  Also, you have
to do all the stuff described in the INSTALL document before anything
works.  You did already, right?



Q: I try to run DGD, but I get things that look like this:

     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 1: cannot include "kernel/kernel.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 2: cannot include "kernel/objreg.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 3: cannot include "kernel/rsrc.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 4: cannot include "kernel/access.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 5: cannot include "kernel/user.h"
     /kernel/sys/driver.c, 6: cannot include "kernel/tls.h"
     Error within runtime_error:
     Compilation within compilation
     Compilation within compilation
     Config error: initialization failed

A: You copied the Kernel Library into the right place, but forgot to
put its headers into the include/kernel directory.  Make sure that's
done correctly and try again.



Q: I run DGD and things look good except that there's no game.  What gives?

A: This is a MUD server.  You'll need to connect to it with a telnet
client on an appropriate port.  Are you already familiar with the
process?  If not, you may find you're more comfortable trying out
CircleMUD or another fully developed MUD.  Phantasmal is definitely
intended for the experienced crowd, and so are all other existing DGD
mudlibs.  We're working on it...



Q: I run DGD and it gives me error messages about the version I'm using.
   What do I do?

A: If may say that this version of Phantasmal is not tested with DGD
beyond some version.  If so, then you've got a slightly old Phantasmal
or Felix has gotten ahead of me with his constant improvement of DGD.
You could use the recommended DGD version -- look at /usr/System/initd.c
for the version check.  Or if things keep working you can just ignore
the error message, or remove it from /usr/System/initd.c.  Or you could
see if there's a newer version of Phantasmal, which shouldn't have
that check.

If it gives you a startup error that your version of DGD just isn't
good enough for it then you're going to need to upgrade to a later
version of DGD, almost certainly an experimental one.  Check out
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD" and click on a link called
something like "Downloading, Compiling and Configuring DGD".



Q: I upgrade from one version of DGD to the next one and everybody
except admin stops being a wizard!  What gives?

A: The Kernel Library stores its listing of who gets wizard privileges
in the file "kernel/data/access.data".  If you delete this then
everybody loses all their privileges.  One way to deal with it is to
manually reinstate everybody.  Another is to grab the file from your
old copy of DGD and restore it.

If you copy the kernel Library stuff to where it should be rather than
symbolically linking it, and you copy the new Kernel Library *over* the old
version, you won't get this problem (unless you overwrite the old
access.data with the new one).  Naturally that approach comes with its
own set of problems, including potential incompatibilities between
future versions of DGD.  Hey, it could happen.



Q: I run DGD and on startup or shutdown I get a Fatal Error that
says "out of sectors".  How come?

A: To run Phantasmal, you must have a phantasmal.dgd file somewhere.
Usually it's in the mudlib directory.  In it, if you look hard, you'll
find there's a swap_size parameter, probably set to 1024 by default.
Try increasing this number.  Now see if you still get the Fatal Error.

One way to detect this problem is to type %status at the command line
of your MUD as an admin.  In the upper left of the text display, under
"Swap device", you'll see a "sectors" entry.  The "sectors" entry
shows you how many sectors your MUD uses and how many it *can* use.
You can also check out memory usage and number of objects.  The
numbers tell you how close you are to exceeding your allowed usage of
various resources.  You may also find that as you come close to the
limit in them, it takes more ticks to do things.  If this happens then
you may run out of ticks before you run out of other resources (like
sectors).  When the numbers get too close together (if you're using
2015 sectors out of 2048, for instance), you'll want to fix the upper
limit in the phantasmal.dgd file.

This stuff all works the same for any MUD based on the Kernel Library,
so the DGD mailing list is a good place to ask about what the numbers
mean and how you can play with them.



Q: I'm using the CVS version of DGD on Windows I get the following
error during startup:

$ ./dgd mud.dgd
Jun 16 10:52:30 ** DGD 1.2.47
Jun 16 10:52:30 ** Initializing...
Can't parse UNQ data passed to unq_dtd:load!
Config error: initialization failed

The system log has the following errors:

/usr/System/sys/errord(unset) ||| Sun Jun 16 10:52:33 2002 / 0.03 [6]
--> Runtime error: Rule 2: bad token [caught]
[...]
/usr/common/obj/basic_unq_parser(unset) ||| Sun Jun 16 10:52:33 2002 / 0.03 [6]
--> Error parsing block: ~DTD{
~channel{name,level}
~name{string}
~level{int}
}
[...]
--> Runtime error: Can't parse UNQ data passed to unq_dtd:load!

A: This could mean that you're using the native Win32 version of CVS
rather than the Cygwin version of CVS.  It appears to convert line
endings to Win32-style or otherwise cause problems for reasons that
aren't entirely clear.  Use a Unix workstation rather than Windows.
Or use the Cygwin version of CVS.  Or convert all your line endings
after checkout from carriage returns to carriage-return/linefeed
pairs.  The last solution may not work if you're doing SourceForge
development for Phantasmal -- it's vitally important that you never
check in anything that has Win32 line endings.



Q: I run DGD and Phantasmal seems to run fine until I try to telnet to
the server.  Then I get an error that looks like this:

Nov 17 02:54:10 ** DGD 1.2.52
Nov 17 02:54:10 ** Initializing...
Nov 17 02:54:13 ** Initialization complete.

Fatal error: cannot create swap file "../tmp/swap"
Abort

A: Remember that the swapfile path is from the MUDLib directory.
Specifically, it's from Phantasmal's MUDLib directory.  You may want
to change it from "../tmp/swap" to "tmp/swap" and create a tmp
directory next to your kernel, usr, log and so on directories.  Or you
may just want to change into your phantasmal directory, type "cd ..",
then "mkdir tmp".  That will create a "../tmp" directory in which DGD
can create a "../tmp/swap" file.

Q: When I start DGD, Phantasmal seems to start fine, but when I telnet in I
can't log on!

A: There is a bug in DGD versions before 1.2.57 which causes Phantasmal to hang
for a while on start up.  Please upgrade to DGD version 1.2.57 or higher.

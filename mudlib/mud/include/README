You don't want to copy files from the Kernel MUDLib in here.  You
especially don't want to replace Phantasmal's std.h or config.h with
the one from the Kernel MUDLib.  It'll cause you problems on startup
if you do.  However, you *do* want to change into the kernel
subdirectory of this directory.  Read the README file there, which
will tell you what to do.

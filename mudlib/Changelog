Release 0.012:
	* More logging and stuff in ObjectD.  And fixed a bug that
	  caused log messages on rebuild.
	* Now the upgraded() function for upgraded objects is called
	  with a call_out, so it executes the new code instead of the
	  old code.  The compiling() function still executes the
	  pre-recompile code.
	* New online help for old Kernel MUDLib commands.  I believe
	  all the Kernel MUDLib legacy commands are now documented.
	* Merged help with @help.  Now the regular help command handles
	  all of it just fine.
	* Slightly different logfile output format.
	* Allow subscription to log and error channels with extra
	  information.  Update "channels" list to show it.
	* LOGD and ERRORD now send out notifications on the log and
	  error channels.
	* Normalized help query strings.  This should let us use fewer
	  search names per help entry, and generate more good matches.
	* Merged object flags into ROOM from SIMPLE_PORTABLE, preparatory
	  to merge of SIMPLE_ROOM and SIMPLE_PORTABLE.
	* Removed unnecessary cmd_social from the SYSTEM_USER object.
	* Fixed bug in path_place...  How long have put and remove not
	  been working?

Release 0.011b:
	* Added @make_portable command, very similar to @make_room.
	* Critical fix to setting examine desc for @make_room.
	* @stat now scrolls its output, takes objects in the room or
	  inventory as arguments and reports better on mobiles.
	* Added "openable" flag to portables, and correspondingly to
	  @stat, @set_obj_flag and the online help.
	* Critical fix to @set_obj_flag -- didn't work before.
	* Added open and close commands, usable by all.
	* Fixed a couple of annoying ObjectD bugs that caused log
	  messages on %code commands.  Still got a known ObjectD
	  bug (and a feature request) to go.

Release 0.011:
	* Lots of refactoring and general code changes.  Always.  Every
	  release.  This one too.
	* Moved command-sets and state-stacks into two separate libraries,
	each inherited by the main user object (/usr/System/obj/user.c).
	* Social verbs are now usable like regular commands.
	* Removed old obsolete detail code
	* Added @set_obj_flag back.  Previously didn't work.
	* Now the MobileD reloads the binder file when recompiled.  So
	  now we can add new mobile types at runtime.
	* Added new "animal" mobile type.  Mobiles can now have extra
	  data embedded in their mobfile entries, which is a pretty
	  mandatory thing for more complex mobiles.
	* Added "idea" command, like bug and typo.  Made sure more
	  information was included in the reports like where the report
	  takes place and who reported it.
	* Added a @make_room command and its associated user states.  The
	  idea is that you can type @make_room and then just answer the
	  questions from there to create a new room object.  Simpler but
	  slower than the older way.
	* Added generic @delete command that will destroy rooms, exits,
	  mobiles or portables.
	* The display of @list_room now scrolls appropriately.
	
Release 0.010:

	* Merged in Keith Dunwoody's patch for merging PORTABLED and MAPD.
	  (New hooks for MOBILEs are included in that patch)
	* Added Jay Shaffstall's patch for escape character codes in UNQ
	parsers.
	* Added MOBILED to track mobiles
	* Updated some zone-related commands to save zones across reboots
	and to create objects in the current zone by default (@new_port,
	@new_room).
	* New @list_mob command to list mobiles by number
	* New @delete_mob command can delete mobiles without accompanying
	user objects.  Note that this can leave bodies behind.
	* @stat command now works on mobiles
	* UNQ DTD error handling now can accept a filename
	* A basic mobfile is now saved like the roomfile and zonefile.  It
	still needs more work before it can be restored, though.
	* Mobiles now have a binder file
	* There is an "unq" builtin type when UNQ parsing for freeform UNQ
	content
	* The %compile command will append a ".c" to the supplied filename
	if the file as mentioned doesn't exist, but the same name with a
	".c" exists and is at least one byte long.
	* There is a @new_mobile command to create a new mobile
	* Added help for new mobile commands
	* UNQ DTDs can now import other DTD's.
	* Improved UNQ DTD type inheritance.
	* The mobfile can now be restored.
	* @new_zone command to add new zones
	* wandering mobiles now work
	* Builtin 'unq' data now works properly
	* A basic sould is in place
	* A "social" command allows socials to be used, slightly awkwardly

                Files Phantasmal Needs

  You need a /usr/game directory.  Phantasmal will use objects in this
directory for configuration.  If you care at all about security,
things in this directory will need to be protected.

  You'll need an /include/gameconfig.h.  It should #define the location
of your GAME_INITD object, usually "/usr/game/initd".

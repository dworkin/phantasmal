What files get updated when we do a release?  What should we check for
accuracy before releasing a new version of Phantasmal on the public at
large?

Everywhere:
  Remove CVS directories, #files#, .#files and files~

  Check for Kernel MUDLib version and DGD version -- allow the widest
  range of DGD versions that seems reasonable.

  Remove player data, remove .old and safe_* files.  Remove *~ files
  again after editing.  Remove objects that were in inventory.

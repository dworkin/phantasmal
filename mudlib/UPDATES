What files get updated when we do a release?  What should we check for
accuracy before releasing a new version of Phantasmal on the public at
large?

First:
  To prepare a release, do an svn export

Everywhere:
  Remove CVS directories, #files#, .#files and files~
  Remove all .cvsignore files
  Check for symlinks

include/phantasmal/version.h, include/version.h
  New version number

usr/System/initd.c
  Check for Kernel MUDLib version and DGD version -- allow the widest
  range of DGD versions that seems reasonable.

usr/game/object/stuff/zone*, usr/game/object/mobfile, usr/game/object/zonefile
  Remove player data, remove .old and safe_* files.  Remove *~ files
  again after editing.  Remove objects that were in inventory.

usr/game/users/*.pwd
  Remove all .pwd files

include/*.h
  Remove float.h, limits.h, status.h, type.h, trace.h

include/kernel/*.h
  Remove all .h files

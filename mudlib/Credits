The Phantasmal MUDLib is primarily written and maintained by Noah
Gibbs.  Other contributors include:

- Keith Dunwoody for patches to merge PORTABLED with MAPD, for major
contributions to the MOBILE infrastructure, and a patch to add new
modifiers to UNQ DTD

- Tom Lokovic for testing, ideas, and work on various speculative or
related projects, including the original design of the UNQ format

- Neil McBride for miscellaneous code and ideas

- Jay Shaffstall for StringD code and escape character codes for UNQ
parsers

- Chris Meshkin for ideas and discussion


And naturally, no set of credits for a DGD MUDLib would be complete
without mentioning Felix Croes (Dworkin), who wrote, who writes and
who maintains DGD itself.

Phantasmal also draws ideas from several other sources, but most
notably Shannon Appelcline's series of Building Blocks articles for
Skotos.

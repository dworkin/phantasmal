The Phantasmal MUDLib is primarily written and maintained by Noah
Gibbs.  Other contributors include:

- Keith Dunwoody for patches to merge PORTABLED with MAPD, for major
contributions to the MOBILE infrastructure, and a patch to add new
modifiers to UNQ DTDs

- Tom Lokovic for testing, ideas, and work on various speculative or
related projects, including the original design of the UNQ format

- Gary (muphicks@mups.co.uk) for a useful patch for the zonefile and
general brainstorming

- Neil McBride for miscellaneous code and ideas

- Jay Shaffstall for StringD code and escape character codes for UNQ
parsers

- Chris Meshkin for ideas and discussion


Other MUDLib authors, who provide ideas and competition.  Thanks to
Steve (Melville) and Erlend (GurbaLib)!

And naturally, no set of credits for a DGD MUDLib would be complete
without mentioning Felix Croes (Dworkin), who wrote and maintains DGD
and the Kernel library.

Phantasmal also draws ideas from several other sources, but most
notably Shannon Appelcline's series of Building Blocks articles for
Skotos.

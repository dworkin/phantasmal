The Phantasmal MUDLib is primarily written and maintained by Noah
Gibbs.  Other contributors include:

- Keith Dunwoody for patches to merge PORTABLED with MAPD, for the
first prototype command parser, for major contributions to the MOBILE
infrastructure, and for a patch to add new modifiers to UNQ DTDs

- Tom Lokovic for testing, ideas, and work on various speculative or
related projects, including the original design of the UNQ format

- Dan Parks for the new exits code, for a bugfix with user login and
password changing, and for some miscellaneous other bugfinding

- Jay Shaffstall for StringD code and several contributions to the UNQ
parser, as well as additional testing to Phantasmal UNQ and Help code
on his own MUD

- Gary Preston (muphicks at mups dot co dot united-kingdom) for a useful
patch for the zonefile and general brainstorming and debugging

- Neil McBride for miscellaneous code and ideas

- Mark Luszniak for requesting more documentation, and for submitting
simple object code.

- Chris Meshkin for ideas and discussion


Other MUDLib authors, who provide ideas and competition.  Thanks to
Steve (Melville), Erlend (GurbaLib) and Beek (Lima)!

And naturally, no set of credits for a DGD MUDLib would be complete
without mentioning Felix Croes (Dworkin), who wrote and maintains DGD
and the Kernel library.

Phantasmal also draws ideas from several other sources, most notably
Shannon Appelcline's series of Building Blocks articles for Skotos.

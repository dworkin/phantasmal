Make nice modular system to answer questions for use with @make_room
and corresponding edit-type mode.  This could also be used for object
attributes and OLC of more flexible attributes.

Make a nice system for UNQ tags being replaced with things like ANSI
color codes.  Generally, put together a usable terminal-type interface.

Make an action system for mobile actions to be queued up and handled.

Currently, actions in the user object (including PHANTASMAL_USER) seem
to use an odd blend of parsing at the command-line and parsing in the
code for the action.  That should be cleanly separated out, even
before we've got a 'real' parser.

Make a set of canonical exits which individual exit instances will
inherit from.  This will avoid putting a fully-localized version of,
say, "north", in every northbound exit.

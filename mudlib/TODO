Longer-term:

Make modular system to answer questions for use with @make_room and
corresponding edit-type mode.  This could also be used for object
attributes and OLC of more flexible attributes.

Make a system for UNQ tags being replaced with things like ANSI color
codes.  Generally, put together a usable terminal-type interface.

Make an action system for mobile actions to be queued up and handled.

Currently, actions in the user object (including PHANTASMAL_USER) seem
to use an odd blend of parsing at the command-line and parsing in the
code for the action.  That should be cleanly separated out, even
before we've got a 'real' parser.

The wiztool should have an interface for the /usr/game/obj/wiztool
(only) to use which will accept an action to perform (create a file,
shut down the MUD, grant new permissions) and the arguments to that
action.  This will allow all the text parsing to happen on the
interface side, not the Phantasmal side.

Make a set of canonical exits which individual exit instances will
inherit from.  This will avoid putting a fully-localized version of,
say, "north", in every northbound exit.

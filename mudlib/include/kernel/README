Replace these files with the ones in the include/kernel directory from
DGD's Kernel MUDLib.  As of DGD version 1.2.66, the files are named
access.h, kernel.h, objreg.h, rsrc.h, tls.h, user.h, and version.h.
However, you should use whatever versions are found in the
mud/include/kernel directory of the DGD Kernel MUDLib for your current
version of DGD.

    <h3 align="center"> Setting Up a Phantasmal-Based MUD </h3>

    <p>
      First you'll need to have Phantasmal installed and working.  You
      can do that with either the bundled version or the regular one,
      but either way you need a Phantasmal test game up and running,
      such as the one that comes with it.  Look at files with names
      like &quot;INSTALL&quot; if you haven't already read them all.
      They're important.  The bundled distribution should be easier --
      download, unpack, run a script.  Use it if this is your first
      time doing this stuff.  It'll be a little harder to upgrade the
      bundled distribution to new versions of Phantasmal and DGD,
      though.
    </p>

    <h3 align="center"> Transitions </h3>

    <p>
      Phantasmal has only just changed over to having a /usr/game
      directory.  Please bear with us in this time of transition.  The
      /data directory is a holdover from the old way of doing things,
      and we'll be getting rid of that when we can.  In the mean time,
      do what you can, or alter Phantasmal to suit yourself, or use
      something else.  Phantasmal is getting easier to use, but it's
      never going to be as easy as Melville.  It's never again going
      to do as little for you, either :-)
    </p>


    <h3 align="center"> Directories </h3>

    <p>
      When you're building your MUD, you'd like to change stuff in
      /data and /usr/game a lot.  You'd like to change stuff in
      /usr/common very little.  And you'd like to not change stuff in
      /usr/System at all, if you can manage.  And you should never,
      never change stuff in /kernel.  There's no reason to do it, and
      you'll break compatibility and security if you try.
    </p>

    <p>
      The /data directory doesn't have much in it any more, and it'll
      keep having less and less there.  That's intentional.
      Everything is moving under the /usr directories, because the
      Kernel Library doesn't give you any file security for stuff in
      /data.
    </p>


    <h3 align="center"> Administrators and Wizards </h3>

    <p>
      Since &quot;wizard&quot; may be a class in your MUD and
      &quot;Immortal&quot; may be an in-character thing too, we like
      to call them &quot;Administrators&quot;.  However, no matter
      what you call them, you'd like to be able to give them different
      levels of power.  That's where those directories can help you.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Implementor or Head Admin is probably going to need ultimate
      cosmic power in your MUD.  You'll want to give him or her full
      access to all directories.  To put it in Phantasmal's terms,
      you'll want to &quot;%grant headadmin / full&quot;, which is how
      an existing head admin awards that power from the command line.
      If you give somebody that kind of power, the MUD will let them
      shut down or reboot the MUD.  It'll let them create and destroy
      any object in the game.  It'll let them crash the MUD in ways
      you can't repair.  It'll let them delegate that power to anybody
      they feel like.  About the only thing they can't do is alter the
      Kernel Library or other non-Phantasmal files on your machine.
      You'd better <i>totally</i> trust somebody before you give them
      this level of power.
    </p>

    <p>
      A coder customizing Phantasmal for you (not just your game), or
      an admin that needs to debug it, will need write access to
      /usr/common.  That will let them change the laws of physics in
      your MUD, the nature of objects, and the ways time and space are
      managed.  This can cause ugly, ugly bugs and you should be
      careful who you give this access to.  You probably don't want
      to let people do this to your running MUD.
    </p>

    <p>
      A high-ranking admin, a coder or a Head Builder will probably
      need full access to your game, but not necessarily to
      Phantasmal.  That means you have <i>some</i> security against
      them, but they can still do anything they want to the
      player-visible bits.  You'll want to give them at least write
      access to /usr/game, and maybe full access.  Write access lets
      them put stuff there, while full access lets them delegate power
      to it.  This will let them change the laws of physics on your
      MUD to some extent, and write very powerful scripts and
      functions, but they still can't alter any of the
      previously-mentioned stuff directly.  This is also the access
      needed to add new rooms and areas to the MUD, and remove
      existing areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new admin will automatically get full access (including
      delegation) to their own directory.  This lets them build
      interesting things in isolation, but not to hook them up to your
      running MUD.  A probationary builder needs this level of access,
      and probably no more.  A normal builder will eventually only
      need this level of access when Phantasmal is more polished.

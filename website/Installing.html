<h2> Getting Phantasmal Up and Running </h2>

<p>
  The (very) short answer is &quot;check the INSTALL file that came
  with your copy of Phantasmal&quot;.  You'll find it in the top-level
  directory, next to stuff like README and either phantasmal.dgd or
  testgame.dgd.
</p>

<p>
  However, if you're installing non-bundled Phantasmal, there are some
  steps in the README that might require a bit more figuring out.
  Note that bundled Phantasmal works differently, and you don't need
  to do most of the steps listed in this file.
</p>

<h3> Getting DGD Up and Running </h3>

<p>
  Before you can do anything else, you'll need DGD up and running.
  Before you can do that, you'll need to know which version you need.
  Your copy of Phantasmal probably came with a file called
  TESTED_VERSIONS in its root directory.  That's a text file, which
  will say something like &quot;DGD 1.2.90-1.2.93&quot;.  That means
  you'll need a recent experimental DGD, something between 1.2.90 and
  1.2.93.  So pick your version of DGD with this in mind.  You may
  also be running other things that require a specific DGD version.
</p>

<p>
  Usually you'll unpack DGD and patch it (see <a
  href="DGD/DGD_Config.html">instructions elsewhere</a> on how to
  create an experimental copy of DGD).  If you're running something
  other than Linux or OS X, you'll need to modify src/Makefile.
  Specifically, you'll need to change the HOST variable to something
  reasonable.  For instance, old copies of Linux will use the 'LINUX'
  value.  Check the DGD documentation for details if the default
  doesn't work for you.  Then go into the 'src' directory and type
  'make install'.  You'll get an error message on installation, and a
  message saying that the error is being ignored.  That's normal if
  you haven't built DGD before in the same directory, or if you
  deleted the old copy of bin/driver last time.  It's not a problem,
  which is why the error is ignored.
</p>

<p>
  Then, you'll need to test the Kernel Library and make sure it works.
  You'll need to modify 'mud.dgd'.  Specifically, find the
  &quot;directory = &lt;blah&gt;&quot; line, and replace the old
  &quot;blah&quot; value with the right thing for wherever you've put
  DGD.  You'll need to use an absolute path, not a relative path, so
  start with a slash or a drive letter, not a dot or a directory name.
</p>

<p>
  Type &quot;./bin/driver mud.dgd&quot; if you're on Unix, or
  &quot;bin\driver mud.dgd&quot; on Windows.  DGD should tell you what
  version you're using, along with a message telling you that it
  initialized.  Then it'll hang there.  That's expected -- that's what
  your MUD server usually looks like when it's running.
</p>

<p>
  Telnet to your local machine, port 6047.  You should get a login
  prompt.  Log in as &quot;admin&quot; (set the new password to
  whatever you like, it won't matter soon), and type 'who'.  You
  should see that you're logged in.  Typing 'people' will tell you a
  bit more.  You can find out <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">more
  about the Kernel MUDLib user commands</a> if you check the web or
  ask around a little.  For now, don't bother &mdash; you'll be using
  Phantasmal soon anyway.
</p>

<h3> Getting Phantasmal Up and Running </h3>

<p>
  Different versions of Phantasmal may have different steps.  When in
  doubt, check the INSTALL file in the root directory of your
  Phantasmal directory.  However, the steps below are typical for
  current non-bundled Phantasmal installation.
</p>

<p>
  To install Phantasmal, you'll need to put the Kernel Library headers
  into place.  The easiest way to do that is to copy all the headers
  from mud/include/kernel in the Kernel Library into the
  include/kernel directory of Phantasmal.  It's possible to
  symbolically link them, but I wouldn't bother if I were you.  When
  you upgrade the Kernel Library, just copy the new headers into
  place.  Note that you'll need to upgrade the Kernel Library when you
  upgrade DGD, at least if the new DGD version has a different version
  of the Kernel Library.
</p>

<p>
  You'll also need to put the rest of the necessary Kernel Library
  code into place.  If you're on a Unix box, this can be a good
  opportunity to use symbolic links.  If you're in Phantasmal's kernel
  subdirectory (usually called something like mudlib/kernel or
  phantasmal-0.016/kernel), and your DGD installation is at a location
  called /usr/local/dgd, you'd type <tt>ln -s
  /usr/local/dgd/mud/kernel/data .</tt> to symbolically link DGD's
  kernel/data directory to act as Phantasmal's kernel/data directory.
  You'll need to do this with all four subdirectories of kernel
  &mdash; sys, lib, obj and data.
</p>

<p>
  If you're not on a Unix box or don't want to use symbolic links, you
  can instead copy the directories into their new locations.  Note
  that upgrading DGD can be error-prone in either case, and that you
  may need to do it slightly differently if you copy than if you
  symbolically link.  See the PROBLEMS file in the root of your DGD
  installation for further details.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking of the PROBLEMS file, make sure to check it if you're
  having problems installing.  That's what it's there for.
</p>

<p>
  You're also going to need to edit phantasmal.dgd so that it works
  right.  Specifically, you're going to need to edit the 'directory'
  entry, the one that says to replace it with your absolute path.
  You'll need to replace it with the absolute path to your copy of
  Phantasmal.
</p>

<p>
  It needs an absolute path, not a relative one.  You should *not* use
  the tilde (~) variable on Unix in the path, just use a straight-up
  path like &quot;/usr/bob/code/phantasmal&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  I like to make a couple of extra convenience files as well.
  Specifically, I'll usually link to the dgd/bin directory in my
  Phantasmal directory, so instead of running the MUD by typing
  &quot;/home/angelbob/code/dgd/bin/driver ./phantasmal.dgd&quot;, I
  can just type &quot;./bin/driver phantasmal.dgd&quot;.  It's up to
  you whether you want to do something similar, put DGD's driver in
  your path, write a script to run DGD for you or what.
</p>

<p>
  I also copy the DGD API documentation into my doc directory.
  Specifically, I copy DGD's &quot;doc/kernel&quot; and
  &quot;doc/kfun&quot; stuff into the same places under Phantasmal for
  easy use.  Again, you may or may not want to.
</p>

<h3> Once You Can Run Phantasmal </h3>

<p>
  If you've followed the instructions above faithfully, you should
  have a running copy of Phantasmal, which you can access by
  telnetting to port 8888 of your local machine.  If you then login as
  admin and type &quot;help&quot; you'll find yourself face to face
  with a pretty daunting amount of online help.  We consider this a
  Good Thing (tm).
</p>

<p>
  However, before doing all of that, make yourself a non-admin
  account.  It's good to have accounts for admins other than just the
  single lone &quot;admin&quot; account, because you'd like to have
  separate space to work in, different privilege levels for different
  accounts, and the ability to have more than one admin log in at
  once.  Good things all.
</p>

<p>
  First, log in and create your new account.  Just give the name of
  the new account when it asks for the login name, and then pick a new
  password when it asks you to.  Then, from the admin account (not the
  new one, the old one), type <tt>grant &lt;name&gt; access</tt>, but
  replace &lt;name&gt; with the actual account name you just made for
  the new admin.  Don't put it in the greater-than and less-than
  signs, that's just to show you what to replace.  The line above
  makes the account an admin account.  That is, it makes it possible
  for it to have admin privileges, though it doesn't actually give
  them any.
</p>

<p>
  Then (no, we're not done yet), still from the old admin account,
  type <tt>grant &lt;name&gt; / full</tt>.  Replace &lt;name&gt; again
  with the same thing.  This grants the new admin account full
  read-write-admin access (that's what &quot;full&quot; means in the
  command line above) to the root directory of your MUD (that's why
  it's a slash, above &mdash; that means the very top-level
  directory).  So the new admin gets full-power access to every file
  in your MUD.  <b>Don't</b> give admin access to somebody you don't
  trust.  Also, back up your MUD regularly, especially if you're
  giving admin access to people that may not be the sharpest knives in
  the drawer...  They can mess up your MUD by incompetence just as
  easily as malice.  Easier, usually.
</p>

<h3> What Now? </h3>

<p>
  Well, you have the online help mentioned above (please note that the
  help for admin and non-admin accounts is different &mdash; don't be
  surprised when you notice).  Phantasmal's web site, the one you're
  looking at, also includes a wide range of <a
  href="Tutorial">Tutorials</a> and similar documentation, which are
  highly recommended.  This stuff has all been written &mdash; use it.

    <h2> How does Phantasmal compare to other MUDLibs? </h2>

    <font size="4">

    <p> That's a fair question.  Naturally this page is quite biased,
      and more information should be sought before you're fully
      satisfied.  The DGD mailing list is an excellent resource for
      this kind of question and I recommend it over my own personal
      opinion as author of Phantasmal :-) </p>

    <p> My current opinion is that the competition is between
      Melville and Phantasmal if you're building most of the game,
      and between 2.4.5 and GurbaLib if you need something that's
      pretty much already a MUD. </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to Melville? </h3>

    <p> Melville and Phantasmal both provide player logins, objects,
      rooms, soulDs and basic descriptions.  They both provide basic chat
      facilities, including a ChannelD. </p>

    <p> Melville also provides in-MUD mail and bulletin boards where
      you can post and read messages.  Its most compelling feature for
      most users, though, is the fact that its code is quite simple.
      Melville doesn't do much extra for you, but its functionality is
      straightforward, and its structure reflects that.  Developers
      have been using it as a very good tutorial for a very long time
      -- it's one of the very oldest DGD MUDLibs. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal is designed for more expansion.  It has a robust
      and well-populated help system, extensive OLC (online creation)
      facilities, several well-defined file formats for loading
      objects, extensive localization, and the ability to recompile
      the MUD on the fly.  It has mobiles, and daemons managing its
      various objects.  It's also based on the Kernel MUDLib, giving
      it a very stable and secure base to work from.  Recent versions
      contain many more features than Melville, despite a few specific
      Melville features that they don't have.
    </p>

    <p> Phantasmal is also in very active development.  The level of
      testing and robustness is now quite comparable to Melville's.
      Looking at a feature comparison, it's all over but the shouting.
      It remains to be seen, though, if developers will begin actually
      creating MUDs based on Phantasmal or if Melville's compelling
      simplicity will continue to win it converts.
    </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to the Kernel MUDLib? </h3>

    <p> Phantasmal is built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and provides
      services on top of it.  The Kernel MUDLib inheritance and
      security services are provided nearly unaltered.  The Kernel
      MUDLib is significantly worse than Phantasmal for providing a
      stereotypical MUD, but it's also cleaner, somewhat more secure
      and tightly written.  Phantasmal is addressing these problems,
      but it's simply not possible to change at Phantasmal's current
      rate and still maintain the extremely high code standards of the
      Kernel Library. </p>

    <p> If you want to build on the Kernel MUDLib, Phantasmal makes a
      fine example of how to do so.  You could also take Phantasmal
      components to use in your own library.  Both Phantasmal and the
      Kernel MUDLib are public domain, so either one can be used or
      relicensed in any way whatsoever. </p>

    <p> In the same way that the Kernel Library provides a base to
      build a MUDLib on, Phantasmal provides a base to build a MUD on.
      Some objects, like the User object, even have the same basic
      interface between Phantasmal and the Kernel Library.  The Kernel
      Library provides services like inheritance, security and events
      to a MUDLib, while Phantasmal provides services like rooms,
      mobiles, containers, recurrent events and basic activities to a
      MUD.  They're a powerful combination, but the Kernel Library can
      also be used separately. </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to GurbaLib? </h3>

    <p> GurbaLib is assessed here mainly based on its web page (now
      apparently defunct).  To the extent that web page is outdated,
      so is this assessment.  Note that GurbaLib has not been in
      development for some time. </p>

    <p> GurbaLib has a large set of game features that Phantasmal does
      not have.  They're not always polished and perfect, but they
      exist.  Some of them, Phantasmal is likely never to have.  Some
      features implemented by GurbaLib but not Phantasmal include:
      wearable and wieldable objects; FTP Daemon and IMUD3 support;
      Actions and Triggers; Message Boards; Races; ANSI colors; Player
      and Site Banning; Vendors; Guilds; Aliases; Skill System. </p>

    <p> The features on that list that Phantasmal will never implement
      are the ones that will be left to individual MUDs.  For
      instance, Phantasmal will probably never have a guild system or
      a class system, but certain Phantasmal-based MUDs will probably
      choose to build such a thing into the game. </p>

    <p> Obviously, GurbaLib as described is more suitable for a
      stereotypical MUD than Phantasmal.  Phantasmal aims to address
      some of those points, but will take more development time to
      catch up.  Phantasmal <i>does</i> have a few points for which it
      can claim superiority -- it can rebuild in-place, either
      individual objects or all at once.  It has a genuinely excellent
      help system.  Its localization is extensive and GurbaLib's is
      basically nonexistent.  Phantasmal has a good security model and
      a well thought-out design, both failing of Gurba's.  However,
      for stereotypical MUD use Phantasmal simply isn't equal. </p>

    <p> GurbaLib isn't based on the Kernel MUDLib, and runs on
      a modified DGD 1.1.  This makes it problematic to follow
      current experimental DGD development.  That may not be a
      problem for you, though, if you don't have or want
      LWOs, atomicity, or other fairly recent features. </p>

    <p> As a standard, out-of-box LPMUD, GurbaLib is probably the best
      currently available.  It isn't as flexible as Phantasmal, nor
      does it show off many of DGD's features (like rebuild-in-place),
      but it has a decent game already built.  GurbaLib is almost
      certainly the best overall choice if you're building a very
      Diku-like MUD on DGD. </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to 2.4.5? </h3>

    <p> The 2.4.5 MUDLib is ugly and nasty inside, it hasn't
      been updated to newer DGD versions and it is very poorly
      suited to demonstrating DGD's impressive functionality.
      Nonetheless it is surprisingly prevalent.  That's because
      it allows you to simply unpack-and-go to get a very
      basic MUD set up, as no other available MUDLib does.
      Being already usable as a game, it often wins over other
      MUDLibs -- they have substantial start-up effort. </p>

    <p> 2.4.5 isn't really comparable to Phantasmal proper, though it
      might be comparable to the test game in Phantasmal's bundled
      package.  Most existing 2.4.5 MUDs started using it because it
      was the only thing available, and continued using it because
      it's painful to switch codebases.  Phantasmal will need to exist
      another decade before it could hope to be such an entrenched
      solution.  I hope it never becomes one. </p>

    <p> Currently 2.4.5 has wearable and wieldable items, combat, food
      and drink, and other general gameplay elements over Phantasmal.
      Phantasmal has localization, OLC, full recompilation and help
      system over 2.4.5.  Even when Phantasmal has extensive gameplay
      features, it still will not replace 2.4.5's biggest advantage,
      the fact that 2.4.5 has been around for a ridiculously long
      time. </p>

    <h3> What about non-DGD MUDLibs? </h3>

    <p> Probably the best non-DGD competition is the Lima MUDLib for
      MudOS.  It's cleaner and structured better than TMI-2, and is
      more modern and powerful than Nightmare.  Lima provides a better
      and cleaner example of a stereotype LPMUD than 2.4.5 or
      GurbaLib.  It obviously doesn't have some of DGD's features like
      atomic functions or statedumps, but is overall a quite
      acceptable alternative in most respects.  It's probably a much
      better choice if what you want is an LPMUD like all the other
      ones out there. </p>

    <p> You could also look at the LDMUD server, but I don't know much
      about it. </p>

    <h3> Any Other MUDLibs Out There? </h3>

    <p> There are a few miscellaneous things like the adaptation of
      LambdaMOO to DGD and Inferno which are in entirely different
      categories.  They don't have enough in common with anything
      mentioned here to really compete with them. </p>

    <p> There are also three SourceForge MUDLibs in early development.
      None of them have released much anything yet, but we can all
      wait eagerly to hear from them.  They are
      <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/aexmud">Aexeon</a>,
      <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/macrocosm">Macrocosm</a>,
      and <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/whedimer">Whedimer</a>.

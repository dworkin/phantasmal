    <h2> How does Phantasmal compare to other MUDLibs? </h2>

    <font size="4">

    <p> That's a fair question.  Naturally this page is quite biased,
      and more information should be sought before you're fully
      satisfied.  The DGD mailing list is an excellent resource for
      this kind of question.  For objectivity, I definitely recommend
      the DGD list over my own personal
      opinion as author of Phantasmal :-) </p>

    <p> My current opinion is that the competition is between
      Melville and Phantasmal if you're building most of the game,
      and between 2.4.5 and GurbaLib if you need something that's
      pretty much already a MUD. </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to Melville? </h3>

    <p> Melville and Phantasmal both provide player logins, objects,
      rooms, soulDs and basic descriptions.  They both provide basic chat
      facilities, including a ChannelD. </p>

    <p> Melville also provides in-MUD mail and
      bulletin boards where you can post and read messages.
      Its most compelling feature for most users, though,
      is the fact that its code is quite simple.
      Melville doesn't do much extra for you, but its
      functionality is reasonably obvious, and
      its structure reflects that.  Developers have been
      using it as a very good tutorial for a very long time
      -- it's one of the very oldest DGD MUDLibs. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal is designed for more expansion.
      It has a robust and well-populated
      help system, significantly more extensive
      OLC (online creation) facilities, several well-defined file
      formats for loading objects, extensive localization,
      and the ability to recompile the MUD on the fly.  It has
      mobiles, and daemons managing its various objects.  Its objects
      do fun tricks of various sorts including height, weight and
      volume.
      It's also
      based on the Kernel MUDLib, giving it a very stable and
      secure base to work from.  As this description implies, the
      latest versions
      contain many more features than Melville, despite a few specific 
      Melville features that they don't have (yet?).  Those features
      are also better documented, with online help and web tutorials
      available for almost everything.
    </p>

    <p> Phantasmal is also in more active development and the
      level of testing and robustness is now quite comparable
      to Melville's.
      Looking at a feature comparison, it's all over but the
      shouting.  However, it remains to be seen if developers
      will begin actually creating MUDs based on Phantasmal
      or if Melville's compelling simplicity will continue to
      win it converts.  After all, most DGD developers are here
      to write a MUDLib anyway, so what's a few more features to
      debug?
    </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to the Kernel MUDLib? </h3>

    <p> Phantasmal is built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and provides
      services on top of it.  The existing Kernel MUDLib commands
      are provided with slightly different names but the same
      syntax and functionality.  The Kernel MUDLib is significantly
      worse than Phantasmal for providing a stereotypical MUD, but
      is also cleaner, much more secure and better written.
      Phantasmal aspires to address these problems once full basic
      functionality is in place. </p>

    <p> If you want to build on the Kernel MUDLib, Phantasmal makes
      a fine example of how to do so.  You could also take
      components piecemeal -- both Phantasmal and the
      Kernel MUDLib are public domain, so either can be used
      or relicensed in any way whatsoever.  Jay Shaffstall, for
      instance, took Phantasmal's UNQ and Help systems for use
      in an unrelated MUDLib. </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to GurbaLib? </h3>

    <p> GurbaLib is assessed here mainly based on its web page
      (see elsewhere).  To the extent that web page is outdated, so
      is this assessment.  Note that GurbaLib has not
      been in development for some time. </p>

    <p> GurbaLib has a large set of game features which are not
      necessarily polished (but have at least been written) that
      Phantasmal does not have.  Some of them, Phantasmal is likely
      never to have.  Some features implemented by GurbaLib but not
      Phantasmal include: wearable and wieldable
      objects;  FTP Daemon and IMUD3 support;
      Actions and Triggers;
      Message Boards;  Races;
      ANSI colors;  Player and Site Banning;
      Vendors;  Guilds;  Aliases;
      Skill System. </p>

    <p> Obviously, GurbaLib as described is more suitable for a
      stereotypical MUD than Phantasmal.  Phantasmal aims to address
      some of those points, but will take significant development to
      catch up.  Phantasmal also has a few points for which it can claim
      superiority -- Phantasmal can rebuild in-place, for instance.
      It has a genuinely excellent help system.
      Its localization is extensive and GurbaLib's is
      basically nonexistent.  However, for general MUD use Phantasmal
      simply isn't equal. </p>

    <p> GurbaLib isn't based on the Kernel MUDLib, and runs on
      a modified DGD 1.1.  This makes it problematic to follow
      current experimental DGD development.  That may not be a
      problem for you, though, if you don't have or want
      LWOs, atomicity, etc.  And since Phantasmal follows the
      latest experimental versions of DGD so closely, the upgrade
      headache may be just as bad as GurbaLib's lack of
      new features. </p>

    <p> As an overall MUD, GurbaLib with its modified DGD 1.1 is
      probably the best currently available.  It isn't as flexible
      as Phantasmal, nor does it show off many of DGD's features
      (like rebuild-in-place), but it has a decent
      game already built.  Phantasmal may one day catch up in that
      respect but GurbaLib is still likely to be a better overall
      choice if you're building a more stereotypical LPC MUD. </p>

    <h3> How does Phantasmal compare to 2.4.5? </h3>

    <p> The 2.4.5 MUDLib is ugly and nasty inside, it hasn't
      been updated to newer DGD versions and it is very poorly
      suited to demonstrating DGD's impressive functionality.
      Nonetheless it is surprisingly prevalent.  That's because
      it allows you to simply unpack-and-go to get a very
      basic MUD set up, as no other available MUDLib does.
      Being already usable as a game, it often wins over other
      MUDLibs -- they have substantial start-up effort. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal has no aspirations to unseat 2.4.5.  Phantasmal
      is already architecturally superior, but will probably never
      be an unpack-and-go Fantasy MUD.  Such a solution
      contributes objectionably to the prevalence of stock
      areas and I choose not to add to the problem. </p>

    <p> Currently 2.4.5 has wearable and wieldable items, combat,
      food and drink, and other general gameplay elements
      over Phantasmal.  Phantasmal
      has localization, OLC, full recompilation and help system over
      2.4.5.  Even when Phantasmal has extensive gameplay features,
      it still will not replace 2.4.5's biggest advantage, the fact
      that 2.4.5 will unpack into a stereotypical LPC MUD.
      Phantasmal isn't meant to. </p>

    <h3> Any Other MUDLibs Out There? </h3>

    <p> There are a few miscellaneous things like the adaptation of
      LambdaMOO to DGD and Inferno which are in entirely different
      categories.  They don't have enough in common with anything
      mentioned here to really compete with them. </p>

    <p> There are also three SourceForge MUDLibs in early development.
      None of them have released much anything yet, but we can all
      wait eagerly to hear from them.  They are
      <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/aexmud">Aexeon</a>,
      <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/macrocosm">Macrocosm</a>,
      and <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/whedimer">Whedimer</a>.
    </p>

    <p> There's also the Skotos stuff, which isn't available at all
      to hobbyists.  But if you want to put together a commercial
      DGD MUD without paying $100,000 a year (the current license
      price directly from Dworkin), you'll definitely need to talk
      to Skotos, and they may throw in the use of their stuff.
      They have a game application process already.  Check out their
      <a href="http://www.skotos.net">site</a>. </p>

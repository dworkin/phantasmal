<h2> How does Phantasmal compare to other MUDLibs? </h2>

<p>
  That's a fair question.  Naturally this page is quite biased, and
  more information should be sought before you're fully satisfied.
  The DGD mailing list is an excellent resource for this kind of
  question and I recommend it over my own personal opinion as author
  of Phantasmal :-)
</p>

<p>
  For DGD, my current opinion is that the competition is between
  Melville and Phantasmal if you're building most of the game, and
  between 2.4.5 and GurbaLib if you need something that's pretty much
  already a MUD.
</p>

<h3> How does Phantasmal compare to Melville? </h3>

<p>
  Melville and Phantasmal both provide player logins, objects, rooms,
  soulDs and basic descriptions.  They both provide basic chat
  facilities, including a ChannelD.
</p>

<p>
  Melville also provides in-MUD mail and bulletin boards where you can
  post and read messages.  Its most compelling feature for most users,
  though, is the fact that its code is quite simple.  Melville doesn't
  do much extra for you, but its functionality is straightforward, and
  its structure reflects that.  Developers have been using it as a
  very good tutorial for a very long time -- it's one of the oldest
  DGD MUDLibs.
</p>

<p>
  Phantasmal is designed for more expansion.  It has a robust and
  well-populated help system, extensive OLC (online creation)
  facilities, several well-defined file formats for loading objects,
  extensive localization, and the ability to recompile the MUD on the
  fly.  It has mobiles, and daemons managing its various objects.
  It's also based on the Kernel MUDLib, giving it a very stable and
  secure base to work from.  Recent versions contain many more
  features than Melville, despite a few specific Melville features
  that they don't have.
</p>

<p>
  Phantasmal is also in active development, which is both good and bad
  -- Melville changes year by year, if that.  Phantasmal may be
  significantly restructured in six months, requiring more effort to
  keep up.  Phantasmal changes fundamental functions far more often
  since it continues to add new functionality.  Melville has been
  entirely static for years, other than security patches.  But
  Phantasmal is careful to maintain a level of testing and robustness
  comparable to Melville's.
</p>

<p>
  Looking at a feature comparison, it's all over but the shouting.  It
  remains to be seen, though, if developers will begin actually
  creating MUDs based on Phantasmal...  Melville's compelling
  simplicity continues to win it converts, and Phantasmal is
  sufficiently different from other MUDs to be intimidating to new
  administrators.  For the moment, neither of them are the basis of
  any known successful MUDs, though a few of Phantasmal's components
  have been used in Jay Shaffstall's 'Electric Sheep' MUD.
</p>

<h3> How does Phantasmal compare to the Kernel MUDLib? </h3>

<p>
  Phantasmal is built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and provides
  services on top of it.  The Kernel MUDLib inheritance and security
  services are provided nearly unaltered.  The Kernel MUDLib is
  significantly worse than Phantasmal for providing a stereotypical
  MUD, but it's also cleaner, slightly more secure and more tightly
  written.  It isn't possible to change at Phantasmal's current rate
  and still maintain the extremely high code standards of the Kernel
  Library, but Phantasmal is improving on all these counts.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to build on the Kernel MUDLib, Phantasmal makes a fine
  example of how to do so.  You could also take Phantasmal components
  to use in your own library.  Both Phantasmal and the Kernel MUDLib
  are public domain, so either one can be used or relicensed in any
  way whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
  Much as the Kernel Library provides a base to build a MUDLib on,
  Phantasmal provides a base to build a MUD on.  Some objects, like
  the User object, even have mostly the same interface in Phantasmal
  as in the Kernel Library.  The Kernel Library provides services like
  inheritance, security and events to a MUDLib, while Phantasmal
  provides services like rooms, mobiles, containers, recurrent events
  and basic activities to a MUD.  They're powerful in combination, but
  the Kernel Library can also be used separately.
</p>

<p>
  For more information about building a MUD on top of the Kernel
  Library, check out <a href="DGD/Kernel">this section</a> of my main
  DGD site.
</p>

<h3> How does Phantasmal compare to GurbaLib? </h3>

<p>
  GurbaLib is assessed here mainly based on its <a
  href="http://gurba.sytes.net/~erlends/gurba.html"> web page </a>.
  To the extent that web page is outdated, so is this assessment.
  Note that GurbaLib has not been in development for some time, and
  its creator isn't planning to do any more work on it.
</p>

<p>
  GurbaLib has a large set of game features that Phantasmal does not
  have.  They're not always polished and perfect, but they exist.
  Many features (guilds, classes) will never be provided by Phantasmal
  proper, but may be provided by games like Seas of Night on top of
  Phantasmal.  Some features, such as IMUD3 support, can't be
  implemented on top of vanilla DGD so Phantasmal may never have them.
  Features implemented by GurbaLib but not Phantasmal include:
  wearable and wieldable objects; FTP Daemon and IMUD3 support;
  Actions and Triggers; Message Boards; Races; ANSI colors; Player and
  Site Banning; Vendors; Guilds; Aliases; Skill System.
</p>

<p>
  Obviously, GurbaLib as described is more suitable for a
  stereotypical MUD than Phantasmal is.  Phantasmal aims to address
  some of those points, but will take more development time to catch
  up.  Phantasmal <i>does</i> have areas in which it can claim
  superiority.  Phantasmal can rebuild in-place, and has a genuinely
  excellent help system.  Its localization is extensive and GurbaLib's
  is basically nonexistent.  Phantasmal has a good security model and
  a well thought-out design, both areas where Gurba does poorly.
  However, for stereotypical MUD use Phantasmal simply isn't up to
  Gurba's feature list, and that's that.
</p>

<p>
  GurbaLib isn't based on the Kernel MUDLib, and runs on a modified
  DGD 1.1.  This makes it problematic to follow current experimental
  DGD development.  That may not be a problem for you if you don't
  want LWOs, atomicity, and other features from the last few years of
  DGD development.
</p>

<p>
  As a standard out-of-box LPMUD, GurbaLib is probably the best
  currently available.  It isn't as flexible as Phantasmal, nor does
  it show off many of DGD's features like rebuild-in-place, but it has
  a decent game already built.  It's a fine reason to never again
  consider using 2.4.5.
</p>


<h3> How does Phantasmal compare to 2.4.5? </h3>

<p>
  The 2.4.5 MUDLib is ugly and nasty inside, it hasn't been updated to
  newer DGD versions and it is very poorly suited to demonstrating
  DGD's impressive functionality.  Nonetheless it is surprisingly
  prevalent.  That's because it allows you to simply unpack-and-go to
  get a very basic MUD set up, as no other available MUDLib does.
  Since it's already usable as a game, it often wins over MUDLibs that
  have substantial start-up effort.  It's also because it's old, old,
  old, so a lot of MUDs used it when there were no other choices.
</p>

<p>
  2.4.5 isn't really comparable to Phantasmal.  Most existing 2.4.5
  MUDs started using it because it was the only thing available (or
  the most compatible with whatever non-DGD driver they ported from)
  and continued using it because it's painful to switch codebases.
  Phantasmal will need to exist another decade before it can hope to
  be such an entrenched solution.
</p>

<p>
  Currently 2.4.5 has wearable and wieldable items, combat, food and
  drink, and other general gameplay elements over Phantasmal.
  Phantasmal has localization, OLC, full recompilation and help system
  over 2.4.5.  Even when Phantasmal has extensive gameplay features,
  it still will not replace 2.4.5's biggest advantage, the fact that
  2.4.5 has been around for a ridiculously long time and is the basis
  of many existing MUDs.
</p>

<h3> What is &quot;Seas of Night?&quot; </h3>

<p>
  Seas of Night is a test game, distributed with Bundled Phantasmal
  and in Phantasmal's CVS repository.  It's an example of how to build
  an actual game on top of the facilities that Phantasmal gives.  When
  you're comparing features between 2.4.5, GurbaLib, Lima and so on,
  Seas of Night is probably a better comparison than Phantasmal is...
  So I'll mention Seas of Night where it's relevant, and where it adds
  features that aren't part of Phantasmal proper.
</p>

<h3> What about non-DGD MUDLibs? </h3>

<p>
  You could also look at the LDMUD server, but there don't seem to be
  any overwhelmingly good MUDLibs.  And if you're going to build your
  own MUDLib from scratch anyway, why not use DGD?  It's a better
  server.
</p>

<p>
  Everything on Amylaar seems to be pretty outdated.  I'd go for MudOS
  if you're looking at non-DGD platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Probably the best non-DGD competition is the Lima MUDLib for MudOS.
  It's cleaner and structured better than TMI-2, and is more modern
  and powerful than Nightmare, LDMUD or Amylaar.  Lima provides a
  better example of a stereotype LPMUD than 2.4.5 or GurbaLib.  It
  obviously doesn't have some of DGD's features like atomic functions
  or statedumps, but is overall a quite acceptable alternative in most
  respects.  It's probably the best choice if what you want is an
  LPMUD like all the other ones out there, but easier to maintain than
  2.4.5.
</p>

<h3> What About Skotos? </h3>

<p>
  As of this writing, Skotos has not yet released their open-source
  offering, SkotOS 2.0.  Until they do so, their library remains
  powerful but exclusive, and it's difficult to get permission to
  build with it.  No significant documentation is publicly available.
</p>

<p>
  When SkotOS 2.0 comes out, that may be a whole other kettle of fish.
</p>

<h3> Any Other DGD MUDLibs Out There? </h3>

<p>
  There are a few miscellaneous things like Inferno, and the
  adaptation of LambdaMOO to DGD.  They're in entirely different
  categories.  They don't have enough in common with anything
  mentioned here to really compete with them.
</p>

<p>
  There are several SourceForge MUDLibs in early development, and
  probably more than aren't on SourceForge.  None of them have
  released much anything yet, but we can all wait eagerly to hear from
  them.  Until they've released code, it's hard to judge them.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://herator.lysator.liu.se/index_en.html">Herator
  </a> MUD Library hasn't publicly published their code, though there
  are a few interesting files that can be downloaded when their
  Subversion repository is up.  I don't know what their schedule is or
  how they plan to publish.  Their pages don't say.  They seem to be
  using the LGPL license for their library.

<h1>Setting Up a Phantasmal-Based MUD</h1>

<p>Everything in this section of the site is talking about writing
your own game on top of Phantasmal, possibly from somebody else's
example. When this section refers to "setting up" a
Phantasmal-based MUD, that's what it means. To install the basic
stuff on your computer, use the INSTALL file that came with
Phantasmal, <b>not</b> this. Just so we're clear.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is more of a standard library for MUDs than a full
MUD. It ships with enough of a game to show you the edge of what's
possible, but mostly you'll need to build your own game on top of
the facilities that it offers. For a more extensive example of
building on top of Phantasmal, you can download the testgame called
Seas of Night. It's part of the Bundled Release. It's also
available separately from Phantasmal's CVS repository in the
'testgame' module.</p>

<p>Setting up a Phantasmal-based MUD requires a lot of writing and
modifying LPC code. If you're not already very familiar with DGD
and LPC, you should become so. DGD documentation is available
<a href="../DGD/index.html">from Phantasmal's SourceForge pages</a>
and LPC documentation is available <a href=
"../DGD/LPC/index.html">in an LPC textbook</a> I'm working on.</p>

<p style="font-size: 75%">Everything in this section of the site is
talking about writing your own game on top of Phantasmal, possibly from
somebody else's example. When this section refers to "setting up" a
Phantasmal-based MUD, that's what it means. To install the basic stuff
on your computer, use the INSTALL file that came with Phantasmal,
<b>not</b> this. Just so we're clear.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is more of a standard library for MUDs than a full MUD. It
ships with enough of a game to show you the edge of what's possible, but
mostly you'll need to build your own game on top of the facilities that
it offers. For a more extensive example of building on top of
Phantasmal, you can download the testgame called Seas of Night. It's
part of the Bundled Release. It's also available separately from
Phantasmal's CVS repository in the 'testgame' module.</p>

<p>Setting up a Phantasmal-based MUD requires a lot of writing and
modifying LPC code. If you're not already very familiar with DGD and
LPC, you should become so. DGD documentation is available <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD">from Phantasmal's SourceForge pages</a>
and LPC documentation is available <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD/LPC/">in an LPC textbook</a> I'm working
on.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Setting Up a Phantasmal-Based MUD </h3>

    <p>
      Phantasmal is more of a standard library for MUDs than a full
      MUD.  It ships with enough of a game to show you the edge of
      what's possible, but mostly you'll need to build your game on
      top of the facilities that it offers.  You can download the
      testgame, Seas of Night, for a more extensive example of
      building on top of Phantasmal.  It comes with the Bundled
      Release, and is available separately from Phantasmal's CVS
      pages.

      Setting up a Phantasmal-based MUD is mainly a matter of writing
      and modifying LPC code.  If you're not already very familiar
      with DGD and LPC, you should become so.  DGD documentation is
      available <a href="http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD"> from
      Phantasmal's home pages </a>, and LPC documentation is available
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD/LPC/"> in an LPC textbook
      </a> I'm working on.

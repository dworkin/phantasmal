    <h3 align="center"> Files You Need for a Phantasmal-Based Game </h3>

    <p>
      You'll need a /usr/game directory.  Most everything that plays
      with Phantasmal will go under it somewhere.  The files below are
      the absolute bare minimum, the farthest you can strip back a
      Phantasmal-based MUD without cutting into Phantasmal itself.
    </p>

    <h3> InitD </h3>

    <p>
      When DGD starts up, it hands off control to the Kernel Library,
      which hands off control to Phantasmal, which hands off control
      to you.  It seems complicated, but you can ignore most of it.
      When you start things up, the create() function of
      /usr/game/initd will get called, so if you want to do things on
      startup, you should make sure that function exists.
    </p>

    <h3> Gameconfig.h </h3>

    <p>
      You'll need a GameConfig.h, which many files include and many
      files use.  Phantasmal doesn't need most of the symbols in it,
      but <i>does</i> use GAME_INITD.

  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Using the distrib_builder Script </h3>

  <p>
    Whether you use the Bundled release, the regular release or CVS,
    you'll need to decide whether you want to work on everything in
    one lump or use the distrib_builder script.  The distrib_builder
    script takes a DGD directory, a Phantasmal directory, and
    (optionally) a game directory and puts them together into a
    Phantasmal Game Bundle, such as the Bundled release of Phantasmal.
    Since putting together a Phantasmal package requires a lot of
    copying and testing, you can save yourself a lot of work by using
    the distrib_builder script.  You can either use it once to set up
    your Bundle, or you can use it constantly for testing.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you decide to use the distrib_builder script constantly for
    testing, you'll do your editing in your subdirectories (mudlib and
    your specific game's directory - mostly your specific game's
    directory) and then run the distrib_builder script every time you
    want a testable MUD bundle.  <i>Please</i> remember that changes
    made in your game bundle directory will be <i>deleted</i> when you
    copy over the new bundle, so <i>don't</i> do a lot of work there
    and then lose it by copying over all the old versions...
  </p>

  <h3> How to Use the Script </h3>

  <p>
    You'll probably want a directory where all your Phantasmal-based
    code lives.  It's the directory you were in when you first did a
    CVS checkout of the Phantasmal code, if you're using the CVS
    version.  We'll refer to it as &quot;code&quot; throughout
    this section.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your Phantasmal directory will be immediately under the code
    directory.  You'll also want to check out the 'tools' module from
    CVS, which contains the Perl script you'll be running.  If you're
    starting with 'Seas of Night' rather than plain Phantasmal, you'll
    also want to check out the 'testgame' module, which contains Seas
    of Night.  So, your code directory will contain directories called
    'phantasmal', 'tools', and 'testgame'.  Change into the 'tools'
    directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your checkout was successful, there will be a file called
    'distrib_builder.pl' in that directory (among others).  Make sure
    you have Perl installed on your system, and then run the script.
    You can run it by typing 'perl distrib_builder.pl', or (in Unix
    only) by executing the file directly, as a command.  This starts
    the script.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have put the appropriate things in the appropriate places,
    the distrib_builder script will find your installations of DGD and
    Phantasmal, and ask if you want to use the appropriate directory
    for each.  If distrib_builder can't find DGD or Phantasmal, or if
    you tell it not to use any of the installations it finds, you can
    then tell it a directory to check.  That directory <i>must</i>
    contain a valid DGD or Phantasmal installation.  If it doesn't,
    distrib_builder will complain and will refuse to use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the testgame module is present, distrib_builder will ask you if
    you want to use it.  If it isn't checked out, distrib_builder will
    ask you if you want to use the built-in game in your Phantasmal
    directory (by asking if you want to use your Phantasmal directory
    as the game directory).  The choice is yours.  Either should work
    fine, though you'll get a different game from testgame and
    phantasmal - they're different from each other, and intentionally
    so.
  </p>

  <p>
    The distrib_builder script will put the game bundle into its own
    directory under your code directory.  If there is already a bundle
    there, the script will ask if you wish to delete it.  It is
    <i>highly</i> recommended that you do so to avoid stale files.  If
    you don't wish to delete the game bundle and want to cancel the
    script's action, you should hit &lt;CTRL&gt;-C immediately - if
    the script is allowed to complete, it will overwrite many of the
    files in your game bundle, which is pretty certainly <i>not</i>
    what you want if you plan to keep it.

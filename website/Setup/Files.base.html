    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Files You Need for a Phantasmal-Based
      Game </h3>

    <p>
      You'll need a <b>/usr/game</b> directory.  Files that interface
      with Phantasmal go under it.
    </p>

    <h3> Gameconfig.h </h3>

    <p>
      You'll need an /include/gameconfig.h file.  Phantasmal will
      include it, and use its GAME_INITD definition to find your
      game's Init object.  A common value for GAME_INITD is
      &quot;/usr/game/initd&quot;.  Note the lack of a &quot;.c&quot;
      on the end.  That's because it's an object name, not a filename.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's standard practice to put similar definitions into
      gameconfig.h, constants that give filenames or object names for
      important game modules.  However, GAME_INITD is the only one
      that's absolutely mandatory (or at least, mandatory without
      changes to Phantasmal proper).
    </p>

    <h3> GAME_INITD </h3>

    <p>
      When DGD starts up, it hands off control to the Kernel Library.
      That hands off control to Phantasmal, which hands off control to
      your game.  It seems complicated, but you can ignore most of it.
      Just pretend that Phantasmal, the Kernel and DGD are all one
      thing &mdash; from your point of view, they are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your GAME_INITD object is the one specified by gameconfig.h.
      Usually, that will be /usr/game/initd, which means the code is
      in /usr/game/initd.c.  It should have a function with the
      signature <tt> &quot;static void create(void)&quot; </tt>.  When
      you start your MUD server, the create() function of the
      GAME_INITD will get called.  So if you want to do things on
      startup, you should make sure the create() function exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      The create() function is called with unlimited ticks and stack
      space.  That means it can take as much processor time or stack
      space as it wants -- functions that get called later on have to
      be much more careful.  So create() is a good place to load large
      files, create large data structures and otherwise do
      preprocessing.  Be careful, though.  If the create() function
      fails, so does the startup of the whole MUD.  And if create()
      runs forever, the MUD will hang without ever letting anybody
      connect.  So avoid infinite loops!
    </p>

    <p>
      Your create() function can configure the various Phantasmal
      daemons and services.  For instance, common ones to configure
      are SoulD and HelpD.  If you want to configure a heart
      beat function or one or more special AUTO objects, create() is
      the place to do that, too.  Your GAME_INITD has privileges that
      no other object in your game does, such as setting ConfigD's
      path_special object.  See the API documentation on specific
      daemons for details of how to configure them, or look at a good
      example like Seas of Night.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most important things for the GAME_INITD to do is to
      register a driver object with Phantasmal.  This uses ConfigD's
      set_game_driver() function, which takes a single object pointer
      as an argument.  The driver object is how Phantasmal will send
      signals, events and various other input to your game.
    </p>

    <h3> The Driver Object </h3>

    <p>
      The object you passed to set_game_driver() is now your game
      driver object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Phantasmal will call various functions on your driver object
      when events (like new connections) happen.  The driver object
      must define functions with the correct names for Phantasmal to
      call.  The functions include new_user_connection,
      get_welcome_message, get_suspended_message, and
      get_shutdown_message.  See the API documentation for
      /usr/game/sys/gamedriver for details.  Your driver object does
      not have to use that object name.  Your driver only required to
      be a valid DGD object that defines functions with the correct
      names.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally when a new user connects, Phantasmal will display a
      welcome message.  To determine the message, Phantasmal will call
      your driver's get_welcome_message function with the new
      connection object.  You may call query_ip_name and
      query_ip_number on the object to determine its origin, and
      return a reasonable welcome message.  If you return nil, the
      connection will be rejected.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Phantasmal is in the process of shutting down, the function
      get_shutdown_message will be called instead.
      Get_shutdown_message also takes a connection object as its only
      argument.  Normally you should inform the user that their
      connection will not be accepted, since Phantasmal will normally
      reject the connection under these circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
      In certain circumstances, Phantasmal will turn off new incoming
      connections.  For instance, it does this when recompiling the
      itself in-place.  Usually the MUD will be suspended for no more
      than a few seconds at a time.  A new incoming connection during
      those seconds will receive a message determined by calling
      get_suspended_message on your driver object.  This function
      takes a single argument, a new connection object.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the new connection is allowed (that is, if
      get_welcome_message does not return nil) and the user types a
      line ending with a newline, then that line will be passed as a
      string to your driver's new_user_connection function.  If that
      function returns nil, the connection is aborted.  If it returns
      a valid DGD object, the connection is allowed.  Any object
      returned should inherit from the PHANTASMAL_USER object, which
      will allow the connection to be properly set up.  The object you
      return from your driver's new_user_connection function is called
      a User Object.
    </p>

    <h3> The User Object </h3>

    <p>
      Phantasmal will currently do login and password confirmation for
      you, using a standard system.  This may change in the future.
      For now, it's true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your User object's code should start by including
      &lt;config.h&gt;.  That defines the symbol PHANTASMAL_USER.
      Your User object must inherit from PHANTASMAL_USER, and it may
      not be private inheritance.  That's because Phantasmal will need
      to call functions from PHANTASMAL_USER, and your User object
      isn't allowed to prevent it from doing so.  At least, if it does
      then things will go badly wrong...
    </p>

    <p>
      After a successful login, Phantasmal will pass new commands to
      the process_command() function of the User Object.  Functions
      like message() and send_phrase() may be used to pass information
      back across the network connection to be viewed by the human
      user.  See the API documentation for the /usr/game/obj/user
      object for details on what functions your User object may call,
      and what functions will be automatically called upon it.  Note
      that your User object doesn't need to be called
      /usr/game/obj/user.  It can be located at any path, as long as
      your User object inherits from the PHANTASMAL_USER library.
    </p>

@@TITLE Interface Files@@

<h3>Files You Need for a Phantasmal-Based Game</h3>

<p>You'll need a <b>/usr/game</b> directory. Files that interface
with Phantasmal go under it. So do other things, potentially. These
files interface fairly directly and are basically mandatory. They
do <i>not</i> include files necessary to interface with various
optional Phantasmal daemons.</p>

<h3>Gameconfig.h</h3>

<p>You'll need an /include/gameconfig.h file. Phantasmal will
include it, and use its GAME_INITD definition to find your game's
Init object. A common value for GAME_INITD is "/usr/game/initd".
Note the lack of a ".c" on the end. That's because it's an object
name, not a filename.</p>

<p>It's standard practice to put similar definitions into
gameconfig.h, constants that give filenames or object names for
important game modules. However, GAME_INITD is the only one that's
absolutely mandatory (or at least, mandatory without changes to
Phantasmal proper).</p>

<h3>version.h</h3>

<p>The file "/include/version.h" isn't strictly required in most
cases, but the bundling script expects it. It should define a
variable called GAME_VERSION which should be a string like "My
Game, v. 1.7" which tells both what the game is and what the
current version is. Remember to update it for each game release (if
you release to the public, or otherwise wish to track
versions).</p>

<h3>GAME_INITD</h3>

<p>When DGD starts up, it hands off control to the Kernel Library.
That hands off control to Phantasmal, which hands off control to
your game. It seems complicated, but you can ignore most of it.
Just pretend that Phantasmal, the Kernel and DGD are all one thing
&mdash; from your point of view, they are.</p>

<p>Your GAME_INITD object is the one specified by gameconfig.h.
Usually, that will be /usr/game/initd, which means the code is in
/usr/game/initd.c. It should have a function with the signature
<tt>"static void create(void)"</tt> . When you start your MUD
server, the create() function of the GAME_INITD will get called. So
if you want to do things on startup, you should make sure the
create() function exists.</p>

<p>The create() function is called with unlimited ticks and stack
space. That means it can take as much processor time or stack space
as it wants -- functions that get called later on have to be much
more careful. So create() is a good place to load large files,
create large data structures and otherwise do preprocessing. Be
careful, though. If the create() function fails, so does the
startup of the whole MUD. And if create() runs forever, the MUD
will hang without ever letting anybody connect. So avoid infinite
loops!</p>

<p>Your create() function can configure the various Phantasmal
daemons and services. For instance, common ones to configure are
SoulD and HelpD. If you want to configure a heart beat function or
one or more special AUTO objects, create() is the place to do that,
too. Your GAME_INITD has privileges that no other object in your
game does, such as setting ConfigD's path_special object. See the
API documentation on specific daemons for details of how to
configure them, or look at a good example like Seas of Night.</p>

<p>One of the most important things for the GAME_INITD to do is to
register a driver object with Phantasmal. This uses ConfigD's
set_game_driver() function, which takes a single object pointer as
an argument. The driver object is how Phantasmal will send signals,
events and various other input to your game.</p>

<h3>The Driver Object</h3>

<p>The object you passed to set_game_driver() is now your game
driver object.</p>

<p>Phantasmal will call various functions on your driver object
when events (like new connections) happen. The driver object must
define functions with the correct names for Phantasmal to call. The
functions include new_user_connection, get_welcome_message,
get_suspended_message, and get_shutdown_message. See the API
documentation for /usr/game/sys/gamedriver for details. Your driver
object does not have to use that object name. Your driver only
required to be a valid DGD object that defines functions with the
correct names.</p>

<p>Normally when a new user connects, Phantasmal will display a
welcome message. To determine the message, Phantasmal will call
your driver's get_welcome_message function with the new connection
object. You may call query_ip_name and query_ip_number on the
object to determine its origin, and return a reasonable welcome
message. If you return nil, the connection will be rejected.</p>

<p>If Phantasmal is in the process of shutting down, the function
get_shutdown_message will be called instead. Get_shutdown_message
also takes a connection object as its only argument. Normally you
should inform the user that their connection will not be accepted,
since Phantasmal will normally reject the connection under these
circumstances.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, Phantasmal will turn off new incoming
connections. For instance, it does this when recompiling the itself
in-place. Usually the MUD will be suspended for no more than a few
seconds at a time. A new incoming connection during those seconds
will receive a message determined by calling get_suspended_message
on your driver object. This function takes a single argument, a new
connection object.</p>

<p>If the new connection is allowed (that is, if
get_welcome_message does not return nil) and the user types a line
ending with a newline, then that line will be passed as a string to
your driver's new_user_connection function. If that function
returns nil, the connection is aborted. If it returns a valid DGD
object, the connection is allowed. Any object returned should
inherit from the PHANTASMAL_USER object, which will allow the
connection to be properly set up. The object you return from your
driver's new_user_connection function is called a User Object.</p>

<h3>The User Object</h3>

<p>Phantasmal will currently do login and password confirmation for
you, using a standard system. This may change in the future. For
now, it's true.</p>

<p>Your User object's code should start by including
&lt;config.h&gt;. That defines the symbol PHANTASMAL_USER. Your
User object must inherit from PHANTASMAL_USER, and it may not be
private inheritance. That's because Phantasmal will need to call
functions from PHANTASMAL_USER, and your User object isn't allowed
to prevent it from doing so. At least, if it does then things will
go badly wrong...</p>

<p>After a successful login, Phantasmal will pass new commands to
the process_command() function of the User Object. Functions like
message() and send_phrase() may be used to pass information back
across the network connection to be viewed by the human user. See
the API documentation for the /usr/game/obj/user object for details
on what functions your User object may call, and what functions
will be automatically called upon it. Note that your User object
doesn't need to be called /usr/game/obj/user. It can be located at
any path, as long as your User object inherits from the
PHANTASMAL_USER library.</p>

<h2>Package Files</h2>

<p>Files in this category don't interface with Phantasmal, exactly,
but you should still have them.</p>

<h3>Game.dgd</h3>

<p>Depending on your game, this may be called mygame.dgd or
test.dgd or game.dgd or anything else you like. However, you should
supply such a .dgd file and make sure it has reasonable settings
for object swapping. If you use a start script and an install
script (like the testgame module does), then be sure to set the
directory entry to "RUN INSTALL SCRIPT FIRST" or something like it,
so that DGD will object if you try to start the MUD without using
the install script first.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>A README file, perhaps an INSTALL file, the license for your
code... These are all good things to have. You should include
them.</p>

<h3>Bundled directory</h3>

<p>If your game is going to be capable of being bundled with DGD
and Phantasmal for easy distribution, you should include a
"bundled" subdirectory with files to copy into the top-level files.
I include a README and an INSTALL file there (note that top-level
files by those names will be deleted during copyover!), as well as
scripts to install and run the MUD. You may do the same, or include
any other files you like.</p>

<h3>Users directory</h3>

<p>Your game should have a /usr/game/users directory. This is where
files for information about game users will be stored. Please bear
this in mind, and grant access to the /usr/game directory
carefully, if at all, to your builders.</p>

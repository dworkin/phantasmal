<h3 style="text-align: center">Using the distrib_builder Script</h3>

<p>Whether you use the Bundled release, the regular release or CVS,
you'll need to decide whether you want to work on everything in one lump
or use the distrib_builder script. The distrib_builder script takes a
DGD directory, a Phantasmal directory, and (optionally) a game directory
and puts them together into a Phantasmal Game Bundle, such as the
Bundled release of Phantasmal. Since putting together a Phantasmal
package requires a lot of copying and testing, you can save yourself a
lot of work by using the distrib_builder script. You can either use it
once to set up your Bundle, or you can use it constantly for
testing.</p>

<p>If you decide to use the distrib_builder script constantly for
testing, you'll do your editing in your subdirectories (mudlib and your
specific game's directory - mostly your specific game's directory) and
then run the distrib_builder script every time you want a testable MUD
bundle. <i>Please</i> remember that changes made in your game bundle
directory will be <i>deleted</i> when you copy over the new bundle, so
<i>don't</i> do a lot of work there and then lose it by copying over all
the old versions...</p>

<h3>How to Use the Script</h3>

<p>You'll probably want a directory where all your Phantasmal-based code
lives. It's the directory you were in when you first did a CVS checkout
of the Phantasmal code, if you're using the CVS version. We'll refer to
it as "code" throughout this section.</p>

<p>Your Phantasmal directory will be immediately under the code
directory. You'll also want to check out the 'tools' module from CVS,
which contains the Perl script you'll be running. If you're starting
with 'Seas of Night' rather than plain Phantasmal, you'll also want to
check out the 'testgame' module, which contains Seas of Night. So, your
code directory will contain directories called 'phantasmal', 'tools',
and 'testgame'. Change into the 'tools' directory.</p>

<p>If your checkout was successful, there will be a file called
'distrib_builder.pl' in that directory (among others). Make sure you
have Perl installed on your system, and then run the script. You can run
it by typing 'perl distrib_builder.pl', or (in Unix only) by executing
the file directly, as a command. This starts the script.</p>

<p>If you have put the appropriate things in the appropriate places, the
distrib_builder script will find your installations of DGD and
Phantasmal, and ask if you want to use the appropriate directory for
each. If distrib_builder can't find DGD or Phantasmal, or if you tell it
not to use any of the installations it finds, you can then tell it a
directory to check. That directory <i>must</i> contain a valid DGD or
Phantasmal installation. If it doesn't, distrib_builder will complain
and will refuse to use it.</p>

<p>If the testgame module is present, distrib_builder will ask you if
you want to use it. If it isn't checked out, distrib_builder will ask
you if you want to use the built-in game in your Phantasmal directory
(by asking if you want to use your Phantasmal directory as the game
directory). The choice is yours. Either should work fine, though you'll
get a different game from testgame and phantasmal - they're different
from each other, and intentionally so.</p>

<p>The distrib_builder script will put the game bundle into its own
directory under your code directory. If there is already a bundle there,
the script will ask if you wish to delete it. It is <i>highly</i>
recommended that you do so to avoid stale files. If you don't wish to
delete the game bundle and want to cancel the script's action, you
should hit &lt;CTRL&gt;-C immediately - if the script is allowed to
complete, it will overwrite many of the files in your game bundle, which
is pretty certainly <i>not</i> what you want if you plan to keep it.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Administrator Directories and
      Privileges </h3>

    <p>
      Since &quot;wizard&quot; may be a class in your MUD and
      &quot;Immortal&quot; may be an in-character thing too, we like
      to call them &quot;Administrators&quot;.  However, no matter
      what you call them, you'd like to be able to give them different
      levels of power.  That's where those directories can help you.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Implementor or Head Admin is probably going to need ultimate
      cosmic power in your MUD.  You'll want to give him or her full
      access to all directories.  To put it in Phantasmal's terms,
      you'll want to &quot;%grant headadmin / full&quot;, which is how
      an existing head admin awards that power from the command line.
      If you give somebody that kind of power, the MUD will let them
      shut down or reboot the MUD.  It'll let them create and destroy
      any object in the game.  It'll let them crash the MUD in ways
      you can't repair.  It'll let them delegate that power to anybody
      they feel like.  About the only thing they can't do is alter the
      Kernel Library or other non-Phantasmal files on your machine.
      You'd better <i>totally</i> trust somebody before you give them
      this level of power.
    </p>

    <p>
      A coder customizing Phantasmal for you (not just your game), or
      an admin that needs to debug it, will need write access to
      /usr/common.  That will let them change the laws of physics in
      your MUD, the nature of objects, and the ways time and space are
      managed.  This can cause ugly, ugly bugs and you should be
      careful who you give access to.  You don't want to let anybody
      do this to your running MUD except your head Implementor.  He
      should only use that access to fix serious bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
      A high-ranking admin, a coder or a Head Builder will probably
      need full access to your game, but not necessarily to
      Phantasmal.  That means you have <i>some</i> security against
      them, but they can still do anything they want to the
      player-visible bits.  You'll want to give them at least write
      access to /usr/game, and maybe full access.  Write access lets
      them put stuff there, while full access lets them delegate power
      to it.  This will let them change the laws of physics on your
      MUD to some extent, and write very powerful scripts and
      functions, but they still can't alter any of the
      previously-mentioned stuff directly.  This is also the access
      needed to add new rooms and areas to the MUD, and remove
      existing areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new admin will automatically get full access (including
      delegation) to their own directory.  This lets them build
      interesting things in isolation, but not to hook them up to your
      running MUD.  A probationary builder needs this level of access,
      and probably no more.  A normal builder will only need this
      level of access when Phantasmal is more polished, and the head
      builder can then hook their stuff up to the running MUD, or copy
      it over into game directories.

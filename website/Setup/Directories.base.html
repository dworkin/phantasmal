<h3>Directory Structure in a Phantasmal-based Game</h3>

<p>The idea is that /usr/game is where your game's rules are kept.
That's the part that <i>you</i> supply, the details of your MUD's
specific world. Phantasmal doesn't need to know what you name your
skills or classes (if any), what you name your commands or exactly
what your users see. Phantasmal (the part in /usr/common and
/usr/System) just keeps track of zones, rooms, exits and NPCs, and
supplies you a standard library of functions to play with. You use
what you want and leave the rest alone. But most especially, you
concentrate on what makes your game special, unique and different,
and let Phantasmal quibble about the basics of getting one object
to fit inside another and what file format is best for separating
English strings from French.</p>

<p>For MUDs with more than one staff member, you'll probably want
different amounts of privilege. Phantasmal doesn't really do that
for you, yet. The idea is that you can put each staff member's
stuff in a separate directory, and then link zones into the main
MUD when they work correctly. That's not fully spelled out yet,
though. However, to let that work, and to support the Kernel
Library's idea of how permissions and security work, each staff
member should get their own account and their own directory. That
directory should be called /usr/bobo for an immortal named "bobo",
for instance.</p>

<p>Note that one <i>more</i> reason not to change /usr/common or
/usr/System is so that you can easily use new versions of
Phantasmal. If you make it easy to upgrade, you'll get new features
for free whenever Phantasmal adds them.</p>

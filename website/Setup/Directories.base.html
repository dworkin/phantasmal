    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Directory Structure in a
      Phantasmal-based Game </h3>

    <p>
      When you're building your MUD, you'd like to change /usr/game a
      lot.  You'd like to change stuff in /usr/common and /usr/System
      very little, if at all, if you can manage.  And you should
      never, never change stuff in /kernel.  There's no reason to do
      it, and you'll break compatibility and security if you try.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is that /usr/game is where your game's rules are kept.
      That's the part that <i>you</i> supply, the details of your
      MUD's specific world.  Phantasmal doesn't need to know what you
      name your skills or classes (if any), what you name your
      commands or exactly what your users see.  Phantasmal just keeps
      track of zones, rooms, exits and NPCs, and supplies you a
      standard library of functions to play with.  You use what you
      want and leave the rest alone.  But most especially, you
      concentrate on what makes your game special, unique and
      different, and let Phantasmal quibble about the basics of
      getting one object to fit inside another and what file format is
      best for separating English strings from French.
    </p>

    <p>
      For MUDs with more than one staff member, you'll probably want
      different amounts of privilege.  Phantasmal doesn't really do
      that for you, yet.  The idea is that you can put each staff
      member's stuff in a separate directory, and then link zones into
      the main MUD when they work correctly.  That's not fully spelled
      out yet, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that one reason not to change /usr/common or /usr/System is
      so that you can easily use new versions of Phantasmal.  If you
      make it easy to upgrade, you'll get new features for free
      whenever Phantasmal adds them.

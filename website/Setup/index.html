    <h3 align="center"> Setting Up a Phantasmal-Based MUD </h3>

    <p>
      First you'll need to have Phantasmal installed and working.  You
      can do that with either the bundled version or the regular one,
      but either way you need a Phantasmal test game up and running,
      such as the one that comes with it.  Look at files with names
      like &quot;INSTALL&quot; if you haven't already read them all.
      They're important.  The bundled distribution should be easier --
      download, unpack, run a script.  Use it if this is your first
      time doing this stuff.

    <h3 align="center"> Transitions </h3>

    <p>
      Phantasmal has only just changed over to having a /usr/game
      directory.  Please bear with us in this time of transition.  The
      /data directory is a holdover from the old way of doing things,
      and we'll be getting rid of that when we can.  In the mean time,
      do what you can, or alter Phantasmal to suit yourself, or use
      something else.  Phantasmal is getting easier to use, but it's
      never going to be as easy as Melville.  Phantasmal does a lot
      more for you than Melville does, and that's the price you pay
      for good security and more capabilities.

<h3>Getting Started &mdash; Modifying the Default Setup</h3>

<p>First you'll need to have Phantasmal installed and working. You
can do that with Bundled Phantasmal, plain Phantasmal, or the CVS
version of Phantasmal. But no matter how you do it, you need a
Phantasmal test game usable, just to make sure Phantasmal's
working. Look at files with names like "INSTALL" if you haven't
already read them. They're important. The bundled distribution
should be easiest -- download, unpack, run a script. Use it if this
is your first time doing this stuff.</p>

<p>If you start from the Phantasmal Bundled release, you'll be
starting with an existing test game, one called Seas of Night. You
can also get the same game as 'testgame' in CVS Phantasmal. If you
start from the non-bundled Phantasmal release (or CVS without
testgame), you'll be getting much less 'game'. You'll need to
decide how much of a clean start you're looking for. The Bundled
Release is easier to learn from, but it may not be the cleanest way
in the long run.</p>

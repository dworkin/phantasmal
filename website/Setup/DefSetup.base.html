      Modifying the Default Setup </h3>

    <p>
      First you'll need to have Phantasmal installed and working.  You
      can do that with either the bundled version or the regular one,
      but either way you need a Phantasmal test game up and running,
      such as the one that comes with it.  Look at files with names
      like &quot;INSTALL&quot; if you haven't already read them all.
      They're important.  The bundled distribution should be easiest --
      download, unpack, run a script.  Use it if this is your first
      time doing this stuff.

    <p>
      If you start from the Phantasmal Bundled release, you'll be
      starting with an existing test game, one called Seas of Night.
      If you start from the non-bundled Phantasmal release, you'll be
      getting much less of a game.  You'll need to decide how much of
      a clean start you're looking for.  The Bundled Release is easier
      to learn from and gives you more of a game.  But may not be the
      cleanest way in the long run.

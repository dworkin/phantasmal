    <p>
      When you're building your MUD, you'd like to change stuff in
      /data and /usr/game a lot.  You'd like to change stuff in
      /usr/common very little.  And you'd like to not change stuff in
      /usr/System at all, if you can manage.  And you should never,
      never change stuff in /kernel.  There's no reason to do it, and
      you'll break compatibility and security if you try.
    </p>

    <p>
      The /data directory doesn't have much in it any more, and it'll
      keep having less and less there.  That's intentional.
      Everything is moving under the /usr directories, because the
      Kernel Library doesn't give you any file security for stuff in
      /data.

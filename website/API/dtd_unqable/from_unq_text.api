	Anybody

DESCRIPTION
	Parse the object from UNQ data.  For more information about
	parsed UNQ format, see basic_unq_parse in the basic_unq_parser

	from_unq in the given object, so you should override this
	method or that one (or both).

	This function isn't access-protected.  You should access-protect
	your version of this and all other inherited functions, including
	upgraded() and destructed().

RETURN VALUE

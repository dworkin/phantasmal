NAME
	mobile_from_dtd_unq - static function, used for partial parsing
	of mobiles from DTD-parsed UNQ

PROTOTYPE
	mixed mobile_from_dtd_unq(mixed *unq)

CALLED BY
	System, Common, Game

DESCRIPTION
	This implements parsing of common fields for mobiles from a
	DTD UNQ description.  A subtype can parse out only the specific
	fields it recognizes, then pass the resulting UNQ to this
	function for further parsing.  See the animal_mobile for a
	simple example.

	If there is a 'data' field in the UNQ data, its value will be
	passed back as the return value.  If there is no such value,
	nil will be returned.

	You should access-protect your version of this and all other
	inherited functions, including upgraded() and destructed().

RETURN VALUE
	The data field from the UNQ object, or nil.

ERRORS
	Unrecognized fields or malformed UNQ will cause errors.

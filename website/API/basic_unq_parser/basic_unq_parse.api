NAME
	basic_unq_parse - convert an UNQ file to parsed UNQ data

PROTOTYPE
	mixed *basic_unq_parse(string text_block)

CALLED BY
	Anybody

DESCRIPTION
	The block is parsed into UNQ and returned as an array.  The
	array will consist of an even number of elements, paired off
	as label and block.  Unlabelled blocks will have a label of
	'nil'.  The blocks will consist of either a single string or
	an array.  If an array, the array will be in the same format
	described here, with an even number of elements alternating
	labels and blocks.

	This UNQ parser will handle backslash escaping, including
	control characters.

RETURN VALUE
	The UNQ data described above, or nil if parsing fails.

ERRORS
	Errors will be caught and logged if parsing fails, but no
	errors will occur in the calling function's scope.

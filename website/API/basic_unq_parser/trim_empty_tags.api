NAME
	trim_empty_tags - remove tag/block pairs with only whitespace

PROTOTYPE
	mixed *trim_empty_tags(mixed *unq_data)

CALLED BY
	Anybody

DESCRIPTION
	Trim empty tags out of the supplied block of UNQ data and
	return it.  Empty tags are those with nil labels, or all-whitespace
	labels, and also have all-whitespace block bodies.  This
	function is not recursive, and won't descend into UNQ block bodies
	to trim out empty tags inside them.

	Many UNQ formats allow unlabelled whitespace but ignore it.  This
	function can automate that process.

RETURN VALUE
	The UNQ data described above.

ERRORS
	Errors will occur if malformed UNQ is passed in.

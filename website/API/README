The .api files in these directories are designed to be used either
standalone or with the apidoc.pl script in the tools directory.  By
running that script from the top-level API directory, you can generate
the API documentation from the Phantasmal web pages in an output
directory called 'html'.

The generated files are actually .base.html files, which can be turned
into fully-formatted HTML pages by the pagebuild script, also in the
tools directory.

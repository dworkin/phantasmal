    <h3 align="center"> Phantasmal's API for Games </h3>

    <p>
      Phantasmal exports a lot of capabilities.  Many of them can be
      called from /usr/game, which is where most of your game code is
      supposed to live.  If you're modifying stuff outside of
      /usr/game, in fact, you're modifying Phantasmal, so you're
      building something nonstandard and not really supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      On these pages, we'll document the APIs that you can call from
      anywhere under /usr/game, and possibly elsewhere.  There are a
      lot more internal Phantasmal APIs, which should probably be
      documented eventually, but we're not going to put those right
      here.  At least, not yet.

<h1>Phantasmal's API for Games</h1>

<p>Phantasmal exports a lot of capabilities. Many of them can be
called from /usr/game, which is where your game-specific code is
supposed to live.</p>

<p>On these pages we'll document the APIs that you can call from
anywhere under /usr/game, and possibly elsewhere. There are a lot
of internal Phantasmal APIs which should probably be documented
eventually... But we're not going to put those here. At least, not
yet.</p>

<p>We may not document each and every thing that you can call or
clone from /usr/game. For instance, there are internal bookkeeping
structures which you could easily make your own sets of. There's no
particular reason for you to use them and no reason that
Phantasmal's set would be especially useful. So we don't document
those. This API documentation is specifically for APIs we intend to
export for the use of /usr/game or of builders on your game.</p>

    <h3 class="center"> Phantasmal's API for Games </h3>

    <p>
      Phantasmal exports a lot of capabilities.  Many of them can be
      called from /usr/game, which is where your game-specific code is
      supposed to live.
    </p>

    <p>
      On these pages we'll document the APIs that you can call from
      anywhere under /usr/game, and possibly elsewhere.  There are a
      lot of internal Phantasmal APIs which should probably be
      documented eventually...  But we're not going to put those here.
      At least, not yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may not document each and every thing that you can call or
      clone from /usr/game.  For instance, there are internal
      bookkeeping structures which you could easily make your own sets
      of.  There's no particular reason for you to use them and no
      reason that Phantasmal's set would be especially useful.  So we
      don't document those.  This API documentation is specifically
      for APIs we intend to export for the use of /usr/game or of
      builders on your game.

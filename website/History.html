<h3 style="text-align: center"> A Brief History of Phantasmal </h3>

<p> I've done a number of MUD projects before Phantasmal, and
  a great many TCP/IP servers in C.  I had switched to a C/Perl
  hybrid and was trying to figure out how to safely interrupt
  Perl code after it had overrun its processor allotment and
  gotten itself all tangled up.  I could control its operations,
  functions and memory usage with the excellent Sandbox
  module, but the processor thing was eluding me.  I'd worked
  out a solution involving an external Perl process which
  could be fully killed and restarted if anything went badly
  wrong, but I had no way to limit the maximum latency... </p>

<p> And then, during a random web search, it hit me.  DGD.
  A server that already <i>did</i> everything I wanted.
  It looked good.  The feature list was beautiful.  The
  additional stuff it did like recompile-in-place and
  atomic functions was awe-inspiring.  It was very actively
  maintained.  It had an intelligent author and the code
  was lean, svelte and secure. </p>

<p> On June 18th, I started building an experimental DGD-based
  MUD to replace my all-custom C-and-perl hybrid MUD (called
  &quot;Black Oyster&quot;).  It was my first work on DGD. </p>

<p> I dug deeper into DGD.  There wasn't much documentation.
  &quot;Read
  the mailing list&quot; was pretty much what it boiled down
  to.  I did.  Then I arranged salient bits into an early
  prototype web site.  And I kept building. </p>

<p> After awhile, I realized that not only was there no good
  MUDLib, people had been asking for one for <i>years</i>, and
  nobody was seriously working on one.  So I cobbled some stuff
  together, built a new public domain ObjectD, released it, and
  added a simple MUDLib on top.  Thus, on February 8, 2002 was
  Phantasmal 0.001 released.  I follow Linus Torvalds' lead on
  object numbers -- start very, very small, with the assumption that
  you can always have a version 1.0 when it's bug-free :-) </p>

<p> Early on, it lived in my personal BitKeeper repository and
  I'd periodically make releases FTPable from my personal
  machine.  I didn't bother to keep statistics, and I don't
  know if anybody bothered to download the early releases.
  It was more learning code for folks on the DGD mailing list,
  and that was plenty for me. </p>

<p> On March 12th, about a month later, I put it up on
  SourceForge.  Development had been pretty wild at the beginning
  and Phantasmal version 0.001 through 0.005 were all before I moved
  to SourceForge.  You can find them there now, but the listed
  downloads are all people that downloaded them as a historical
  curiosity or because some later release didn't work :-) </p>

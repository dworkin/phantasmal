<h3 style="text-align: center"> Developing With Phantasmal </h3>

<h4 style="text-align: center"> Documentation </h4>

<p> Maybe you're helping to add features to Phantasmal.  Maybe
  you're developing your own MUDLib and you're starting from
  Phantasmal.  Both work pretty much exactly the same way, and
  either way this document has some tips for you. </p>

<p> First off, you <i>need</i> to read the documentation.  I'm
  aware there's a lot of it out there, at least compared to
  similar Open Source projects.  I consider that a good thing.
  This web site (
  <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">
    http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net</a>), the DGD-specific
  sister site (
  <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD">
    http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD </a>), those are
  obvious.  Also, read the documentation directory within
  Phantasmal itself.  You'll find it in /doc/design and
  /doc/api.  It's often out-of-date, but it documents
  several things that are simply not mentioned anywhere
  else.  Feel free to submit improvements and updates to it,
  you're helping the larger community by doing so. </p>

<p> The SETUP text file in Phantasmal's root directory contains a
  bit about its overall architecture, and you'll get a bit in
  README and INSTALL as well.  Make sure to look through them.
  These files are prominently placed.  That's because Phantasmal
  aims at developers rather than &quot;end-users&quot; who will
  use the MUD as supplied.  We don't want a lot of stock MUDLibs,
  so try to be creative :-) </p>

<p> The final sources of documentation are the community itself.
  Look to the DGD mailing list and the Phantasmal Sourceforge
  forums.  I try to fold the information from the list and forums
  into the web site, but I'm only human.  Nothing beats the
  original source for detail and elaboration.  And speaking of
  &quot;the original source&quot;, remember that the DGD community
  is still small.  That means there are limits to what you can
  find within it, but it also means that anybody you can find is
  happy to answer questions.  I love to do so (I can steal my
  answers back and put them on the web site).  Steve Schmidt the
  Melville author (aka mobydick), is also quite pleasant and
  polite.  He's still active on the DGD mailing list.  If you've
  got a question related to Phantasmal or Melville, you'll find
  the DGD Mailing List is an appreciative forum. </p>

<p> In the extended DGD community is Skotos -- they keep Dworkin
  fed by paying him money.  They keep DGD humming along and they
  occasionally contribute to the mailing list.  They frequently
  write new <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>.
  You can find a little &quot;Phantasmal's Best Of&quot; for those
  articles <a href="Innsmouth/Articles.html">here</a>. </p>

<h4 style="text-align: center"> The Source Tree </h4>

<p> After you've read the documentation, it's time to grab some
  sources and play with them.  Before you start developing a
  MUDLib or DGD itself, make sure you can use the regular
  code-drops.  That means making an experimental version of DGD
  from 1.2.50 and a bunch of patches.  Then grab the latest
  release of Phantasmal from SourceForge.  There's a lot of
  documentation on how to do that on the DGD site and in the
  INSTALL text file in Phantasmal.  Alternately, skip all that and
  grab the bundled version, but it's harder to do SourceForge
  development for Phantasmal that way. </p>

<p> There's a choice you're going to have to make if you're
  developing your own MUDLib -- will you keep up with mainstream
  Phantasmal, or will you branch off at some point and do stuff on
  your own?  Phantasmal is in the public domain so you can legally
  do either, or you can do a hybrid of both.  If you're keeping up
  with Phantasmal or taking a hybrid approach then you'll need to
  keep a Phantasmal source tree around.  Then you can keep it up
  to date with regular diffs and patching.  Features that you want
  to keep, you can fold right in.  Anything that conflicts with
  your own work, you'll need to adapt or discard. </p>

<p> So get the latest CVS version of Phantasmal and keep it
  well-updated.  Once you've set up the repository, make sure to
  run &quot;cvs update -Pd&quot; regularly.  Those options will
  prune away empty directories, which is usually a good thing, but
  can occasionally be irritating. </p>

<p> There are a lot of other things that may be useful for your
  project.  To see my recommendations for development, check out
  the document for <a href="SFDevelopment.html">SourceForge
  Phantasmal Development</a>. </p>

<p> This last bit is just a matter of courtesy, but I'd love
  to know how you're doing with Phantasmal.  Let me know
  what parts you like, what parts you hate, and where you
  think I was obviously smoking something illegal with my
  head up various of my orifices.  If you have problems
  that you think might be caused by what I wrote instead
  of what you wrote, or especially problems you fix, let
  me know about it.  I'll put you on the Credits page if
  you ask, or if I happen to think about it :-) </p>

<p> And bear in mind -- more than anything else, development
  is <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/comics/sf20030303.gif">
    a state of mind</a>. </p>

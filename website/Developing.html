    <font size="4">

    <h4 align="center"> Documentation </h4>

    <p> Maybe you're helping to add features to Phantasmal.  Maybe
      you're developing your own MUDLib and you're starting from
      Phantasmal.  Both work pretty much exactly the same way, and
      either way this document has some tips for you. </p>

    <p> First off, you <i>need</i> to read the documentation.  I'm
      aware there's a lot of it out there, at least compared to
      similar Open Source projects.  I consider that a good thing.
      This web site (
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">
	http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net</a>), the DGD-specific
      sister site (
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD">
	http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD </a>), those are
      obvious.  Also, read the documentation directory within
      Phantasmal itself.  You'll find it in /doc/design and
      /doc/api.  It's often out-of-date, but it documents
      several things that are simply not mentioned anywhere
      else.  Feel free to submit improvements and updates to it,
      you're helping the larger community by doing so. </p>

    <p> The SETUP text file in Phantasmal's root directory
      contains a bit about its overall architecture, and
      you'll get a bit in README and INSTALL as well.  Make
      sure to look through them.  These files are prominently
      placed specifically because Phantasmal aims at
      developers rather than &quot;end-users&quot; who will
      use the MUD as supplied. </p>

    <p> The final sources of documentation are that community
      itself -- the DGD mailing list, the Phantasmal Sourceforge
      forums.  While I try to fold the information from these
      sources into the other web sites and text files, nothing beats
      the original source for detail and elaboration.  And speaking
      of &quot;the original source&quot;, remember that the DGD
      community is still small.  That means there are limits to what
      you can find within it, but it also means that basically
      anybody you can still find is happy to answer questions.  I
      love to do so (I can steal my answers back and put them on the
      web site), and Steve, the Melville author, is also quite
      pleasant and polite, and is still active on the DGD mailing
      list.  If you've got a question related to MUDLibs generally
      or to Phantasmal or Melville specifically you'll find the DGD
      Mailing List is an appreciative forum. </p>

    <p> In the extended DGD community is Skotos -- they keep
      Dworkin fed, they keep DGD humming along and they occasionally
      contribute to the mailing list.  They frequently write
      new <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>.
      You can find a little &quot;Phantasmal's Best Of&quot; for
      those articles <a href="Innsmouth/Articles.html">here</a>. </p>

    <h4 align="center"> The Source Tree </h4>

    <p> After you've read the documentation, it's time to grab
      some sources and play with them.  Before you start
      developing a MUDLib or DGD itself, make sure you can use
      the regular code-drops.  That means making an experimental
      version of DGD from 1.2 and a massive number of patches at
      the moment, and grabbing the latest release number of
      Phantasmal from SourceForge.  There's a lot of documentation
      on how to do that on the DGD site and in the INSTALL text
      file in Phantasmal. </p>

    <p> There's a choice you're going to have to make if you're
      developing your own MUDLib -- will you keep up with
      mainstream Phantasmal, or will you branch off at some
      point and do stuff on your own?  Phantasmal is in the
      public domain so you can legally do either, or you can
      do a hybrid of both.  If you're keeping up with Phantasmal
      or taking a hybrid approach, you'll need to keep a
      Phantasmal source tree around and see how the diffs work.
      Features that you want to keep, you can fold right in.
      Anything that conflicts with your own work, you'll need
      to adapt or discard. </p>

    <p> To do that, you'll want to get the latest CVS version of
      Phantasmal and keep it well-updated.  Once you've set up the
      repository, make sure to run &quot;cvs update -Pd&quot;
      regularly, though you'll note that any empty directories not
      in CVS you have will go away when you do -- that pesky
      &quot;-d&quot; option prunes empty directories.  You'll still
      want to update periodically, and if the directory deletion
      bothers you, you can always put an empty
      &quot;.cvsignore&quot; file into the directory or something
      similar to keep it from going away. </p>

    <p> There are a lot of other things that may be useful for
      a clean project.  You may want to do some or all of
      them.  To see my version of those things, check out
      the document for <a href="SFDevelopment.html">SourceForge
	Phantasmal Development</a>, especially the things
      about adding new types of objects, new commands and so
      on. </p>

    <p> There can be problems with using the Win32 native CVS
      client.  As a non-Windows-user I'm just quoting another
      developer on this, but try the Cygnus CVS version as an
      alternative if you're having troubles.  Check out the
      PROBLEMS text file that comes with Phantasmal for a more
      complete description of how this problem manifests. </p>

    <p> This last bit is just a matter of courtesy, but I'd love
      to know how you're doing with Phantasmal.  Let me know
      what parts you like, what parts you hate, and where you
      think I was obviously smoking something illegal with my
      head up various of my orifices.  If you have problems
      that you think might be caused by what I wrote instead
      of what you wrote, or especially problems you fix, let
      me know about it.  I'll put you on the Credits page if
      you ask, or if I happen to think about it :-) </p>

    <p> And bear in mind -- more than anything else, development
      is <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/comics/sf20030303.gif">
	a state of mind</a>. </p>

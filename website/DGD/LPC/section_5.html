    <h1> <a name="SEC4.3" href="index.html#SEC4.3">Chapter 5: LPC/Library
	Interface</a> </h1>

    <p>
      So far, we've dwelt almost entirely on the LPC language
      and the constructs within it that DGD supports or encourages.
      However, to actually <i>do</i> anything in DGD, you need
      an interface to standard libraries and an interface to
      outside events.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of this writing, there are a reasonable variety of libraries
      (aka MUD libraries or mudlibs) available for DGD, including the
      Kernel Library, Phantasmal, Melville, GurbaLib, 2.4.5, Inferno,
      BBLib and other small or obscure libraries.  There are also
      libraries that exist but aren't generally available such as
      Skotos' libraries and the DGD libraries that support Yahoo Chat.
      There may be more, unreleased and unknown, waiting in the
      wings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each and every one of these libraries exists on top of another
      interface.  Phantasmal, BBLib and Skotos' libraries all build on
      the Kernel Library.  The Kernel Library, Melville and 2.4.5 all
      work directly on top of DGD's interface.  This section will
      discuss DGD's direct interface, the lowest level of interface
      available to a library.  The Kernel Library, a very different
      but very valuable resource, will be discussed in chapter 6.

    <h1> <a name="SEC5.0" href="index.html#SEC5.0">Chapter 5: LPC/Library
	Interface</a> </h1>

    <p>
      So far, we've dwelt on the LPC language and the parts of it that
      DGD supports or encourages.  But to actually <i>do</i> anything
      in DGD, you need an interface to standard libraries and an
      interface to outside events.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a reasonable variety of libraries (aka MUD libraries
      or mudlibs) available for DGD, including the Kernel Library,
      Phantasmal, Melville, GurbaLib, 2.4.5, Inferno, BBLib and
      others.  There are also libraries that aren't generally
      available.  Skotos' libraries and the libraries for Yahoo Chat
      are examples.  There are probably more, unreleased and unknown,
      waiting in the wings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of these libraries exists on top of another interface.
      Phantasmal, BBLib and Skotos' libraries all build on the Kernel
      Library.  Melville and 2.4.5 work directly on top of DGD's
      interface. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter will discuss DGD's direct interface,
      the lowest level of interface available to a library.  The
      Kernel Library, a very different but very valuable resource,
      will be discussed in chapter 6.
    </p>

    <p>
      The latest updates on DGD configuration files and the interface
      to the driver object can be found in DGD's &quot;doc&quot;
      directory, in a file called &quot;Introduction&quot;.  If there
      is any conflict between what you read here and that file in your
      copy of DGD, that file is correct.  Some details change from
      version to version of DGD, and their Introduction file will give
      the details.
    </p>

    <h2> <a name="SEC5.1" href="index.html#SEC5.1">
	5.1 DGD's Configuration File </a> </h2>

    <p>
      Every time you run DGD, you need to tell it a configuration
      file.  You can also optionally give it a statedump, but that
      won't be covered until later.  If your DGD driver binary is
      called &quot;driver&quot; and your configuration file was called
      &quot;mud.dgd&quot;, you'd type &quot;./driver mud.dgd&quot;, at
      least under Unix.  On a Windows system, you'd just say
      &quot;driver mud.dgd&quot;.  More likely you'd need to give a
      pathname, like &quot;driver ..\mud.dgd&quot;, but we're assuming
      here that you know the basics of command lines and pathnames.
      If you don't, maybe you should find a hobby other than running a
      MUD -- or just learn to use your OS's command line, it's not
      that difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      That configuration file is pretty complicated and arcane looking.
      Let's examine one, shall we?
    </p>

    <p> <pre>
telnet_port     = 8888;                 /* telnet port number */
binary_port     = 8889;                 /* binary port number */
directory       = "/code/phantasmal/testgame";  /* Replace w/ your absolute
                                                 path! */
users           = 40;                   /* max # of users */
editors         = 40;                   /* max # of editor sessions */
ed_tmpfile      = "tmp/ed";             /* proto editor tmpfile */
swap_file       = "tmp/swap";           /* swap file */
swap_size       = 4096;                 /* # sectors in swap file */
cache_size      = 100;                  /* # sectors in swap cache */
sector_size     = 512;                  /* swap sector size */
swap_fragment   = 32;                   /* fragment to swap out */
static_chunk    = 64512;                /* static memory chunk */
dynamic_chunk   = 261120;               /* dynamic memory chunk */
dump_file       = "tmp/dump";           /* dump file */

typechecking    = 2;                    /* highest level of typechecking */
include_file    = "/include/std.h";     /* standard include file */
include_dirs    = ({ "/include", "~/include" }); /* directories to search */
auto_object     = "/kernel/lib/auto";   /* auto inherited object */
driver_object   = "/kernel/sys/driver"; /* driver object */
create          = "_F_create";          /* name of create function */
    </pre>
  </p>

    <h3> <a name="SEC5.1.1" href="index.html#SEC5.1.1">
	5.1.1 Network and Directories </a> </h3>

    <p>
      Note that text surrounded by <b>/* */</b> are comments, just
      like in LPC.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first entries are the telnet_port and binary_port entries.
      Either can be a single entry, like above, or an array like
      the include_dirs entry is above.  For instance, if you wanted
      three binary ports, you could say something like:
    <pre>
binary_port = ({ 8889, 8890, 9725 })
    </pre>
    Versions of DGD before the late 1.2 series would only allow a
    single telnet port and a single binary port.  No standard
    version of DGD allows outgoing network connections, and none
    is ever expected to, for security reasons.  You can find
    a patch to make your personal version allow outgoing connections
    if you look around on the internet for a bit.  You're taking
    your security in your own hands if you do this, though.
  </p>

    <p>
      The directory entry is an absolute path to the place to find
      the library's code.  An absolute path means it starts with
      a slash or backslash, not dots or a tilde.  On Unix systems,
      use slashes.  On Windows systems, use backslashes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Swap_file is the name of the swap file that DGD will use for
      your objects when they're not in the active set in RAM (if you
      don't know what this means, don't worry).  The swap file of a
      running game can get big.  You can control just <i>how</i> big
      with the swap_sectors and sector_size entries in this file.
      Usually it stays pretty small for a test program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dump_file is where DGD will put your statedump when your
      library requests one.  Statedumps are a way of saving and
      restoring an entire running MUD all at once.
    </p>

    <h3> <a name="SEC5.1.2" href="index.html#SEC5.1.2">
	5.1.2 Resource Limits </a> </h3>

    <p>
      The users entry is how many simultaneous users your MUD
      supports.  The sky's the limit, but bear in mind that you
      can increase this later if you need to.  Also bear in mind
      that your current hardware will only be powerful enough
      to support a certain number of people well.  Would you
      rather have fifty people gush about how incredible your MUD
      is, or five hundred talk about how slow and buggy it is?
    </p>

    <p>
      &quot;Editors&quot; is how many people can be simultaneously
      editing files.  DGD has a built-in editor that few people would
      want to use.  This is how many instances can be running at once.
      The ed_tmpfile entry is the filename that editor temp files
      will use when people are mid-edit.
    </p>

    <h3> <a name="SEC5.1.3" href="index.html#SEC5.1.3">
	5.1.3 Memory and Swapping </a> </h3>

    <p>
      Swap_size is the total number of sectors in the swap file, and
      sector_size is how big one of those sectors is.  Every object
      (except Light-Weight Objects, LWOs, which we talk about later)
      in LPC takes some number of sectors.  If it takes less than some
      whole number of sectors, the number gets rounded up.  So if an
      LPC object requires 2 sectors plus five bytes, it'll get rounded
      up to three sectors.  If your sector_size is very small, you
      won't waste much memory but swapping will be slower.  If the
      sector_size is large then you'll find that DGD swaps things to
      and from the disk faster, but you waste more memory.  The usual
      default sector_size is 512 bytes, and it works pretty well for
      most simple applications.  Larger applications that swap massive
      volumes of data should consider increasing the size, though that
      can actually worsen the problem in some cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      The swap_size is simpler to choose than sector_size.  You'll
      find yourself having to increase it periodically as your game
      gets bigger and you start running out of memory or sectors.  In
      some cases, the MUD running very slowly can be a symptom of too
      small a swap_size, so try increasing it every so often to see if
      it helps performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cache_size is how many of those sectors stay in RAM.  The
      bigger this is, the faster your library runs and the more of
      your memory (as opposed to disk space) it takes up.  You'll need
      to decide how much memory you want to devote to your running
      game.  Making this bigger than swap_size is pretty pointless.
      Making them equal just means that everything runs in memory
      instead of on disk, so DGD effectively stops being disk-based.
      Since DGD understands what it's doing better than your OS's
      virtual memory system, you should only make DGD fully
      memory-based for libraries that can hold everything in available
      RAM all at once.  Do everybody a favor -- don't do this on the
      same machine you use for your desktop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several (or many) times a second, DGD will swap some objects
      from memory to disk.  That way, it uses less of your RAM on LPC
      objects it isn't currently playing with.  It dumps the stuff you
      haven't been using recently first, and it chooses some fraction
      to dump out to the disk.  It will only do this if more than
      cache_size entries are currently in memory.  The swap_fragment
      is the denominator of the fraction.  That means that if
      swap_fragment is 50, DGD will dump 1/50th of your objects to the
      disk when it swaps.  So if you had 500 objects in memory and you
      didn't load any more in, you might have 500, then 490, then 481,
      then 462, and so on, as DGD dumps 1/50th of each new number of
      objects.  DGD swaps objects out at the end of each thread of
      execution.  We'll cover what that means in a later chapter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The static_chunk and dynamic_chunk tell DGD how much memory to
      use in a way that's pretty difficult to understand.  Unless you
      start running out of memory, I wouldn't recommend touching
      these.  Consulting with the author of DGD or the DGD mailing
      list would be appropriate if you're doing a really large
      application and you need the app to be very carefully memory
      tuned.
    </p>

    <h3> <a name="SEC5.1.4" href="index.html#SEC5.1.4">
	5.1.4 LPC and Interface </a> </h3>

    <p>
      The typechecking determines how carefully DGD checks your LPC
      code for correctness and questionable behavior.  A typechecking
      value of 2 is the strictest, and the default for most libraries.
      It's highly recommended that your library leave it on that
      setting so DGD can catch more of your bugs for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you reduce it to 1, the values &quot;nil&quot; and
      &quot;0&quot; stop being different from each other, just like in
      many other LPC dialects.  If you reduce typechecking to 0,
      function typechecking mostly goes away and &quot;nil&quot; is
      still the same thing as &quot;0&quot;.
    </p>

    <p>
      The include_file is automatically included by every LPC program
      as it's compiled.  This is a way for you to add standard
      #defines and things that every file will have automatically
      defined.  Be careful what you put in this file because there
      are some things you can't put before an &quot;inherit&quot;
      statement, and you'd like to be able to use inheritance
      in at least <i>some</i> LPC stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
      The include_dirs are a list of directories that will be
      automatically searched for LPC include files.  If you use C or
      C++ for anything, this is like the include directories that you
      put in the command line or the project settings.  This tells DGD
      where you're going to put all your header files.  You can use a
      tilde in these paths to mean the user's home directory.  Note
      that this is the user's home in the DGD directories, not the
      home directories of the person installing DGD in the first
      place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The auto_object is automatically inherited by every other object
      in the game except the Driver.  This is one of your big ways to
      interface with DGD.  The auto_object entry tells DGD where to
      find this object.  The path is relative to the base directory
      you gave in the &quot;directory&quot; entry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The driver_object gets called by DGD to notify your library of
      external events.  It's the only object that doesn't inherit from
      the auto object (other than the auto object itself).  Section
      5.2 gives the details of when and how the driver is called.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an object is initialized, a create function is called.  The
      name of this function is given by the create entry in this file.
      If the create function doesn't exist, it doesn't get called.
      You can put a create function in the auto object, which
      guarantees it exists, but make sure you understand about
      nomask functions and how regular functions can be masked before
      you do this.
    </p>

    <p>
      The array_size entry gives the maximum number of objects that
      can be in an array or mapping.  Since DGD will store the entire
      array or mapping in a single in-memory object which will be
      swapped all at once, it's in your best interests to keep this
      number reasonable.  There are <i>still</i> some ways you can
      make unreasonably large objects that get swapped all at once,
      but this helps keep simple bugs from destroying your library's
      performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The objects entry tells DGD the maximum number of objects you
      want to allow.  If you want to make this much above 64,000
      you'll need to change some compile options within the DGD code,
      though they're pretty easy to modify.  This total only counts
      regular DGD objects, not arrays, mappings or Light-Weight
      Objects, so this really doesn't limit you very much.  Again,
      this exists to keep simple bugs from utterly destroying your
      performance in ways that are very difficult to track down.
    </p>

    <p>
      DGD allows you to make a function call with a built-in time
      delay.  After the delay is up, the call happens.  This is called
      a call_out.  The number of these that can be stacked up and
      waiting to happen is given by the call_outs entry.
      Multiprocessor and versions of DGD after the late 1.2 series
      don't necessarily limit the number of call_outs.  This entry may
      not make any difference for those versions of DGD.
    </p>

    <h2> <a name="SEC5.2" href="index.html#SEC5.2">
	5.2 DGD Library API </a> </h2>

    <p>
      A library under DGD is basically a set of LPC programs that
      respond to events of various kinds, especially network events.
      The library needs to receive these events from DGD, and to
      request services from DGD in response.  For instance, DGD might
      tell the library that a new incoming connection has been
      attempted, and the library would need to tell DGD to accept the
      connection and send a banner and login prompt.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Driver object accepts notification of various internal and
      external events.  DGD calls different functions on the Driver to
      let it know that specific things have occurred.  The Auto object
      modifies how the library can request services from DGD, and what
      is or isn't allowed.
    </p>

    <h3> <a name="SEC5.2.1" href="index.html#SEC5.2.1">
	The Auto Object </a> </h3>

    <p>
      Only the Auto object and the Driver object are guaranteed access
      to DGD's standard functions in their original form.  In most DGD
      libraries, the Auto object will override some of these functions
      and substitute new ones with the same names so that the
      underlying version is masked.  For instance, the Kernel Library
      uses this to supply a new get_dir function, one that returns
      a list of compiled objects in the directory along with the
      file names, sizes and modification times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some libraries use this trick for security.  For instance, the
      Kernel Library carefully checks all calls to read and write
      files so that only users with the correct permissions can
      perform those operations.  The Kernel Library also overrides the
      create() function to do extra bookkeeping and keep track of
      owners and creators for LPC objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Auto object also allows the library to add convenience
      functions.  The Melville library supplies an input_to()
      function, which allows an object to set what function will
      handle the next network input to arrive.  Melville also supplies
      simple string handling functions and other basic standard
      library functions which the DGD driver doesn't have by default.
    </p>

    <h3> <a name="SEC5.2.2" href="index.html#SEC5.2.2">
	The Driver </a> </h3>

    <p>
      (Note: big chunks of this section are based on the standard DGD
      documentation.  The copyright to that documentation is held by
      Felix Croes, the author of DGD.  The material is used with
      permission)
      </p>

    <p>
      The Driver is notified by DGD when various events occur,
      and it's also called by DGD to query certain information.
      It needs to define a lot of functions, which do many and
      various things.  Those functions are:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>void initialize(void)</dt>
      <dd>
	This function is called when the system starts up originally,
	or after a reboot, but not after restoring from a statedump.
      </dd>

      <dt>void restored(void)</dt>
      <dd>
	This function is called when the system is restored from
	a statedump.
      </dd>

      <dt>string path_read(string path)</dt>
      <dd>
	Used to translate a path for the built-in editor read command.
	If this function returns nil, the file can't be read.
      </dd>

      <dt>string path_write(string path)</dt>
      <dd>
	Used to translate a path for the built-in editor write command.
	If this function returns nil, the file can't be written to.
      </dd>

      <dt>object call_object(string objname)</dt>
      <dd>
	When a call_other(object,...) happens, including with the
	object.call() syntax, DGD calls this function in the Driver to
	find &quot;object&quot;, the object whose function is being
	called.  You can call compile_object() from call_object().
	That may be a good idea if the object isn't already compiled.
      </dd>

      <dt>object inherit_program(string file, string program, int priv)</dt>
      <dd>
	When one program inherits another, DGD calls inherit_program
	in the Driver to find the LPC object for the program being
	inherited from.  If priv is 1, it's private inheritance.
	Otherwise, it's normal inheritance.  &quot;File&quot; is the
	one choosing to inherit, and &quot;program&quot; is the one
	being inherited.  You can call compile_object() from
	inherit_program().  That's probably a good idea if
	&quot;program&quot; hasn't already been compiled.
      </dd>

      <dt>string path_include(string file, string path)</dt>
      <dd>
	An &quot;include&quot; statement in an LPC file will
	substitute the text of the included file directly, so nothing
	needs to be compiled (unlike call_object or inherit_program
	above).  However, the Driver can still choose what file will
	be included.  When the file is included, DGD will call the
	Driver's path_include function, and the returned string is the
	path of the file that will be included.  If nil is returned,
	no file will be included and a compile error will occur.  If a
	path to a file that doesn't exist is returned, pretty much the
	same thing will happen.
      </dd>

      <dt>void recompile(object obj)</dt>
      <dd>
	This function is called by DGD to indicate to the Driver that
	the parent class of an object is out of date.  If the Driver
	responds by actually recompiling the object then it will
	use the new version of the parent class, and will again be
	up-to-date.  See the section on inheritance for further
	details.  This is a pretty complicated subject if you want
	to do it well.
      </dd>

      <dt>object telnet_connect(int port)</dt>
      <dd>
	Note: this didn't take a &quot;port&quot; parameter in older
	versions of DGD.<br/> This function should create and return a
	User object for the new connection on the given telnet port.
	&quot;Port&quot; will be an offset into the array of telnet
	ports, so if there's only a single telnet port it will always
	have a value of zero.  If nil is returned, the new connection
	will be rejected.  See <a href="#SEC5.2.3">section 5.2.3</a>
	for details on creating a User object.
      </dd>

      <dt>object binary_connect(int port)</dt>
      <dd>
	Note: this didn't take a &quot;port&quot; parameter in older
	versions of DGD.<br/> This function should create and return a
	User object for the new connection on the given binary port.
	&quot;Port&quot; will be an offset into the array of binary
	ports, so if there's only a single binary port it will always
	have a value of zero.  If nil is returned, the new connection
	will be rejected.  See <a href="#SEC5.2.3">section 5.2.3</a>
	for details on creating a User object.
      </dd>

      <dt>void interrupt(void)</dt>
      <dd>
	This function is called if DGD receives a kill signal, for
	instance if the computer's user shuts it down from the command
	line or the Windows Task Manager.  Normally, it will shut down
	the system and perhaps dump state.  Sometimes a forcible
	shutdown happens as a result of a bug, so it may be useful to
	save additional debugging information when this occurs.
      </dd>

      <dt>void compile_error(string file, int line, string err)</dt>
      <dd>
	DGD calls this function in the driver to let it know that a
	compile error has occurred.  Usually this is a syntax error of
	some kind, or a type error.  Several of these can happen in
	sequence for a single LPC file being compiled before a runtime
	error results from the failed compilation.  &quot;File&quot;
	is the file being compiled, &quot;line&quot; is the line
	number in that file where the error occurred, and
	&quot;err&quot; is a human-readable description of what the
	error was.
      </dd>

      <dt>void runtime_error(string error, int caught, int ticks)</dt>
      <dd>
	The driver receives this function call when a runtime error of
	some kind occurs in normal, non-atomic code.  This may be a
	failed function call, a lack of ticks or stack space, an
	explicit error signalled with the error() function, or many
	other possible problems.  If the error is caught by a
	<b>catch</b> construct, &quot;caught&quot; will be equal to 1
	plus an index into the return value of call_trace() indicating
	the frame in which the error was caught.  &quot;Error&quot; is
	a human-readable description of the error that occurred.
	&quot;Ticks&quot; tells how many ticks of processor time were
	available when the error occurred.  Note that runtime_error is
	called with unlimited processor time and stack space, so don't
	worry about it being called when a function runs out of ticks
	-- that will work just fine.
      </dd>

      <dt>void atomic_error(string error, int atom, int ticks)</dt>
      <dd>
	This function is essentially the same as runtime_error,
	but is called when the error occurs in atomic code.  &quot;Atom&quot;
	is an index into the return value of call_trace() indicating the
	frame in which the atomic code begins.  Atomic_error, like
	runtime_error, is called with unlimited stack space and processor
	ticks.<br/>
	Note that atomic_error, since it is called atomically, may not
	write to files or network connections.
      </dd>

      <dt>int compile_rlimits(string objname)</dt>
      <dd>
	If an LPC program uses the rlimits() construct, DGD will call
	this function on the Driver with that object's name.  If the
	compile_rlimits function returns nonzero then that object is
	allowed to use rlimits() without restriction.  If
	compile_rlimits returns 0 then every time the object tries to
	use rlimits(), DGD will query the Driver with runtime_rlimits
	to make sure it's okay.
      </dd>

      <dt>int runtime_rlimits(object obj, int stack, int ticks)</dt>
      <dd>
	DGD calls this function of the Driver to see if the supplied
	object is permitted to use rlimits() with the given arguments.
	A value less than zero for stack or ticks means unlimited,
	while a value of zero means no change.  A positive value will
	set the limit to that value.  If runtime_rlimits returns 0,
	the usage is illegal and will abort with an error.  A nonzero
	return value means the rlimits call is legal.
      </dd>

      <dt>void remove_program(string objname, int timestamp, int index)</dt>
      <dd>
	Whenever a master object is removed, DGD calls this function
	on the Driver object.  The object has already been destructed
	by the time this function is called, so find_object() on
	objname will fail or return a different issue.  The index is a
	unique number for each issue of the object, so if multiple
	versions are compiled with the same name, each one will still
	have a different index for this call.<br/> It's very important
	to track object removal because when a master object is
	destructed, all of its clones and child objects are destructed
	as well.  Since this code should <i>really</i> never be
	allowed to fail, it's called with unlimited stack and processor
	time.  It's also called from inside a catch{} statement.<br/>
	It's important to track object inheritance, but doing so well
	can be very complex.  Read about Object Inheritance for details.

	The User Object </a> </h3>

    <p>
      The User object, like the Driver, defines specific functions.
      DGD will call those functions to notify the user object that
      certain things have happened.  The User object must be a regular
      DGD object, created with clone_object() or compile_object().  It
      may not be a Light-Weight Object created with new_object().
    </p>

    <p>
      DGD calls the following functions on a User object:

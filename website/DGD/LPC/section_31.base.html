<h2><a name="SEC3.1" href="index.html#SEC3.1" id="SEC3.1">3.1 Basic
programming concepts</a></h2>

<p>We begin with he basic programming principles and the structure
of LPC and the LPC environment.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.1.1" href="index.html#SEC3.1.1" id=
"SEC3.1.1">What is programming?</a></h3>

<p>This is a very philosophical question. This book will answer it
very practically instead. Programming basically is the art of
identifying a problem and putting the solution into symbols a
computer can understand. A good programmer has a highly developed
ability to see how a given problem can be split into smaller
problems. He has several solutions to each of those small problems.
He knows which particular solution he should pick to make the
result as effective as possible for the exact problem he is
solving, and the exact way he is solving it.</p>

<p>A programmer, as the previous passage suggests, actually tells
the computer how to solve a problem. A computer can not come up
with a solution to a problem itself. However, it's a lot quicker
than you are, so problems that you can solve but would take you
several lifetimes are handled quickly by the computer.</p>

<p>What you need to learn is that special way of thinking that
allows you to do this 'subdividing' where you see the steps needed
to get from the beginning state to the solved state. You also need
to learn the methods that make up these steps. This tutorial won't
teach you 'how to program', it will only teach you the language
used to write the program.</p>

<p>Who'll teach you programming then, if you don't already know how
to? Other administrators, if you're working on somebody's else's
game, and of course yourself. Hard work is the primary way that
people learn to program. But since you'll need to put many hours
into it, there are worse ways than a MUD to learn what you need to
know.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.1.2" href="index.html#SEC3.1.2" id=
"SEC3.1.2">Compiled/Interpreted code</a></h3>

<p>Programs are nothing but files full of instructions for the
computer. To program is to write lists of instructions in such a
way that the computer reaches a predefined goal and accomplishes a
task. Usually a program is compiled - translated - into a low-level
code expressed in binary symbols (high and low electrical states in
computer memory) which the computer understands with ease. The
actual language you use to program is merely a convenient
go-between, a compromise which both you and the computer can
understand. The reason you compile code is that the translation
step is fairly complicated and time-consuming. You'd rather just do
that once and then store the result, using it directly over and
over again.</p>

<p>LPC however, isn't usually compiled -- it's interpreted. The
instructions are read and translated to the computer one by one,
executed and forgotten. That's not 100% true. In fact, the driver
translates the LPC code into an intermediate simple instruction
code. When you run an LPC program, the instruction set is traced,
line by line as described above, causing the computer to execute a
predefined set of actions defined by the instructions.</p>

<p>The difference between having interpreted and compiled code is
that while the compiled code is quicker, the interpreted version is
much esier to modify. If you want to change something in the
compiled version you have to make the change in the source code,
then recompile and store the new version, then try it out. With
interpreted code you just make the change in the source and run it.
With LPC you need to instruct the driver to destroy the old object
instruction set as well -- more about that later.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.1.3" href="index.html#SEC3.1.3" id=
"SEC3.1.3">Programs</a></h3>

<p>Programs are described above as files containing instructions to
the computer. LPC programs are just programs written in the LPC
language. These files should be named something ending in the
letters <tt>`.c'</tt> (e.g. <tt>`test.c'</tt>) so that the driver
knows that it's dealing with an LPC program. Program names can be
any string of printable characters less than or equal to 32
characters in length, beginning with a letter. However, in practice
it is recommended that you limit yourself to less than 16 letter
strings containing only lowercase letters. If you want the name to
contain two or more words, separate them with the <tt>`_'</tt>
character (e.g. <tt>`my_file_name.c'</tt>). If you're really
cautious, you can limit yourself to MS-DOS 8.3 filenames, those
with no more than eight characters before the dot, no more than one
dot and no more than three characters after the dot.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.1.4" href="index.html#SEC3.1.4" id=
"SEC3.1.4">Objects</a></h3>

<p>An <b>object</b> in LPC is simply a copy of an existing and
loaded program in computer memory. When a program is loaded into
memory to produce a <b>master object</b> the code is compiled to
produce the instruction list. A new chunk of memory is associated
with it for internal <b>global variables</b> (described later).
When a copy, a <b>clone</b> of this program is made, a special
reference called an <b>object pointer</b> is created. That pointer
is given a reference to the master code instruction list and a
unique chunk of memory. If you clone the object another time, a new
pointer is created and a new chunk of memory allocated. When an
object is destroyed its associated memory is freed for use by other
objects, but the instruction list is kept untouched. An object is
<i>always</i> cloned from the master object. If you want to change
the program you must update the master object to instruct the
driver that a new list of instructions is to be compiled from the
source code.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.1.5" href="index.html#SEC3.1.5" id=
"SEC3.1.5">Object makeup</a></h3>

<p>An object is comprised of things called <b>functions</b> and
<b>variables</b>. A function is a set of instructions you can
reference by a name. A variable is a kind of data container for use
by the functions. Some functions are already defined by the driver.
They are called <b>external functions</b>, or <b>efuns</b>. DGD
calls them <b>kernel functions</b>, or <b>kfuns</b> Functions
defined in LPC code are called <b>local functions</b>, or
<b>lfuns</b>. To confuse matters further there is a set of
functions that count as efuns, but are written in LPC. These
functions are sometimes called <b>simulated efuns</b> or
<b>sfuns</b>. DGD calls them <b>auto functions</b> or <b>afuns</b>.
Luckily, you don't really need to remember any of that.</p>

<p>A kernel function is a function that is implemented by the
driver. Usually that means that it's impossible to create in LPC.
Take for example the function <code>write_file()</code> that allows
you to write bytes to a file. It's impossible to make that up from
other functions in LPC, so it has to be in the driver. This kfun is
available in <i>all</i> LPC programs under DGD, though it may be
masked by the AUTO object to appear different or behave
differently.</p>

<p>The function <code>add_exit()</code> adds an exit in a room. It
is only available in specific object types, rooms in this case. It
is written in LPC. It's a good example of a local function. Lfuns
are usually part of the makeup of the environment in which the
objects are used, and they often operate on mudlib or domain data.
<code>Add_exit()</code>, for instance, is aware of directions and
travel costs, a very limited and specific concept.</p>

<p>The function <code>creator()</code> is a good example of the
third case. It's a function that is available in every object. It
returns information about who created a certain object. This
information is specific to the environment since it deals with such
notions as code localization, and mainly because the driver doesn't
directly export such a function. This kind of function is easy to
write in LPC but must be available in all objects, as if it were a
kernel function. The AUTO object is inherited by every other object
except the Driver LPC object. For reasons that are explained later,
this means that public functions of the AUTO object are available
from every other object. This is what gives the name "AUTO
functions", or afuns. This functionality is perfectly transparent
to you; you just use them as you use any other kernel function.</p>

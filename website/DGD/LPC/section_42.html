      This chapter will teach you what you need to know in order to
      actually produce code in the game environment. It will avoid the
      more complicated or inessential subjects, leaving them for
      chapter three.  This chapter contains more about the mudlib and
      the workings of the driver, knowledge necessary to produce

      This section explains several functions.  They will be repeated
      in their correct context later, but are mentioned here as
      background for discussion.

    <p>
      To present things on the screen for the player to read,
      the <code>message()</code> function is called on that player's
      user object.  Different mudlibs supply the user object in
      different ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two special characters that are often used to format
      text, <tt>tab</tt> and <tt>newline</tt>.  They are written as
      <code>\t</code> and <code>\n</code> respectively within DGD
      strings.  The <tt>tab</tt> character inserts 8 space characters
      and <tt>newline</tt> breaks the line.
    </p>

    <pre>
void message(string text);
e.g.
    user->message(&quot;Hello there!\n&quot;);
    user->message(&quot;\tThis is an indented string.\n&quot;);
    user->message(&quot;This is a string\non several lines\n\tpartly\nindented.\n&quot;);

    /* The result is:

	LPC revisited</a></h2>

    <p>
      Let's go through more of the LPC constructs that we didn't
      finish in the LPC Basics section.  Now that you know the
      basics and can use them for simple scripts, it's time to
      find out more of what LPC can do.
    </p>


    <h3><a name="SEC4.2.1" href="index.html#SEC4.2.1">
	Function calls</a></h3>

    <p>
      There are two kinds of function calls, internal and
      external. We've only discussed internal calls so far.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="SEC4.2.1.1" href="index.html#SEC4.2.1.1">
	Making object-internal function calls</a></h4>

    <p>
      <a name="IDX57"></a>

      Making an internal function call is as simple as writing the
      function name and putting any arguments within parentheses
      afterwards. The argument list is simply a list of expressions,
      or nothing.  A function call is an expression if it returns a
      value.  A function call followed by a <code>;</code> is a
      statement.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;function&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;);
e.g.
    pi = atan(1.0) * 4;
    </pre>


    <h4><a name="SEC4.2.1.2" href="index.html#SEC4.2.1.2">
	Making single object-external function calls</a></h4>

    <p>
      <a name="IDX58"></a>

      An external call is a call from one object into another. In
      order to do that you need an object reference to the object you
      want to call.  We haven't discussed exactly how you acquire an
      object reference yet, but assume for the moment that it already
      is done for you.  Object references (the same thing as object
      pointers) can be stored in variables of type
      <code>object</code>.
    </p>

    <pre>
mixed &lt;object reference/object path&gt;-&gt;&lt;function&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;);
mixed call_other(&lt;ob ref/ob path&gt;, &quot;&lt;function&gt;&quot;, &lt;arg list&gt;);
e.g.
    /*
     * Assume that I want to call the function 'compute_pi' in the
     * object &quot;/d/Mydom/thewiz/math_ob&quot;, and that I also have the
     * proper object pointer to it stored in the variable 'math_ob'
     */
    pi = math_ob-&gt;compute_pi(1.0);
    pi = &quot;/d/Mydom/thewiz/math_ob&quot;-&gt;compute_pi(1.0);
    pi = call_other(math_ob, &quot;compute_pi&quot;, 1.0);
    pi = call_other(&quot;/d/Mydom/thewiz/math_ob&quot;, &quot;compute_pi&quot;, 1.0);
    </pre>

    <p>
      Note that you can either use the <code>call_other</code>
      function or just use the -&gt; notation.  One is syntactic sugar
      for the other.  The behavior is identical either way.  Note
      that if you use the <code>call_other()</code> form, you need
      to put quotes around the function name since you're actually
      supplying any string -- which can be a variable, or the
      result of a computation:
    <pre>
pi = call_other(math_ob, &quot;computer&quot; + &quot;_pi&quot;, 1.0);
    </pre>
  </p>

    <p>
      If the object you call hasn't been loaded into memory yet, it
      will be.  If it has a <code>create()</code> function that hasn't
      been called, that function will be called (note that the
      <code>create()</code> function may have a different name if DGD
      is configured differently).  If an external call is made to a
      function that doesn't exist in the object you call, nil will be
      silently returned without any error messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you use an object path (a string) instead of an object
      reference, the <b>master object</b> will be called.  The master
      object can contain data just like any of the clones, and is
      often a good place to store a central copy of information that
      all clones want to use without each one needing its own copy.
    </p>


    <h3><a name="SEC4.2.2" href="index.html#SEC4.2.2">
	Inheriting object classes</a></h3>

    <p>
      Assume that you want to code a door.  Doing that means that you
      have to create functionality that allows the opening and closing
      of a passage between two rooms. Perhaps you want to be able to
      lock and unlock the door, and perhaps you want the door to be
      transparent.  All of this must be taken care of in your code.
      Furthermore, you have to copy the same code and make small
      variations in description and use <i>every time</i> you want to
      make a new door.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while you'll get rather tired of this, particularly
      because you'll find that other wizards have created doors of
      their own that work almost - but not quite - the same way your
      does, rendering some of your nifty objects and features useless
      anywhere but in your domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The object oriented way of thinking is that instead of doing
      things over and over, you create a basic door object that can do
      all the things you want any door to be able to do. Then you just
      inherit this generic door into a specialized door object where
      you configure exactly what <i>it</i> should be able to do from
      the list of available options in the <b>parent</b> door.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is even possible to inherit several different objects in
      order to combine the functionality of several object types into
      one.  Be aware that if a class's parent objects define functions
      with the same names, they will clash.  It may not be easy to fix
      this problem, so avoid inheriting from more than one parent
      until you're reasonably sure what you're doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The syntax for inheriting objects is very simple. In the top of
      the file you write this:
    </p>

    <pre>
inherit &quot;&lt;file path&gt;&quot;;
e.g.
	inherit &quot;/std/door&quot;;
	inherit &quot;/usr/common/object&quot;;
    </pre>

    <p>
	
      Note that this is <i>not</i> a preprocessor command, it is a
      statement, so it does <i>not</i> have a <code>#</code> in front
      of it.  It also ends with a <code>;</code>.  As you see you may
      specify that it's a <tt>.c</tt> file if you wish, but that's not
      required.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>child</b> object (the one that declares the inheritance,
      as above) will inherit all inheritable functions and variables.
      If a child object has a function with the same name as a
      function in the parent, the child's function will <b>mask</b>
      the parent's.  When the function is called by an external call
      to the child, the child function will be executed.  To call the
      parent function from the child, call the function name with the
      scope operator, <code>::</code>, before it.

    <pre>
void my_func()
{
    /* 
     * This function exists in the parent, and I need to
     * call it from here.
     */
    ::my_func();        /* Call my_func() in the parent. */
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      It is not possible to call a masked function in the parent by an
      external call -- only from within the object itself. If an
      object inherits an object that has inherited another object,
      e.g. C inherits B that inherits A, then masked functions in A
      are available in B.  If B masks that function then C will get
      B's version when it calls the function with the scope operator.
      If B doesn't mask the function then C would get A's version
      instead.
    </p>

    <h3><a name="SEC4.2.3" href="index.html#SEC4.2.3">
	Type identification</a></h3>

      Due to the fact that all variables are initialized to 0 or nil,
      and that many functions return 0 or nil when failing, it's
      desirable to be able to determine what value you actually have
      received.  Also, if you use the <code>mixed</code> type it's
      essential to be able to test what the variable contains at any
      specific time. For this purpose there's a special function
      called <code>type_of()</code>.  It uses constants listed in the
      header file &lt;type.h&gt;.
    </p>

    <pre>
#include &lt;type.h&gt;

    </pre>


<h3><a name="SEC60" href="index.html#SEC60">Type qualifiers</a></h3>

<p>
The very types you assign variables and function can have qualifiers
changing the way they work. It's very important to keep them in mind
and use the proper qualifier at the proper time. Most work differently
when applied to variables rather than functions, so a bit of confusion
about how they work usually is quite common among the programmers. Try
to get this straight now and you'll have no problems later

</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="lpc.html#SEC61">static (variable)</a>: The static variable qualifier
<li><a href="lpc.html#SEC62">static (function)</a>: The static function qualifier
<li><a href="lpc.html#SEC63">private</a>: The private function/variable qualifier
<li><a href="lpc.html#SEC64">nomask</a>: The nomask function/variable qualifier
<li><a href="lpc.html#SEC65">public</a>: The public function/variable qualifier
<li><a href="lpc.html#SEC66">varargs</a>: The varargs function qualifier
</ul>



<h4><a name="SEC61" href="index.html#SEC61">The static variable qualifier</a></h4>
<p>
<a name="IDX66"></a>

</p>
<p>
This is a problematic qualifier in the respect that it works differently
even for variables depending on where they are! Global variables, to
begin with, are (as you know) variables that are defined in the top of
the file <i>outside</i> any function. These variables are available in all
functions i.e. their <b>scope</b> is object-wide, not just limited to one
function.

</p>
<p>
It is possible to save all global variables in an object with a special
efun (described later). However, if the global variable is declared as
<code>static</code>, it is <i>not</i> saved along with the rest.

</p>

<pre>
static string   TempName;        /* A non-saved global var. */
</pre>



<h4><a name="SEC62" href="index.html#SEC62">The static function qualifier</a></h4>
<p>
<a name="IDX67"></a>

</p>
<p>
A function that is declared <code>static</code> can not be called using
external calls, only internal. This makes the function 'invisible' and
inaccessable for other objects.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC63" href="index.html#SEC63">The private function/variable qualifier</a></h4>
<p>
<a name="IDX68"></a>

</p>
<p>
A variable or function that has been declared as <code>private</code> will not be
inherited down to another object. They can only be accessed within
the object that defines it.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC64" href="index.html#SEC64">The nomask function/variable qualifier</a></h4>
<p>
<a name="IDX69"></a>

</p>
<p>
Functions and variables that are declared as <code>nomask</code> can not be
masked in any way, neither by shadowing nor inheriting. If you try you
will be given an error message.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC65" href="index.html#SEC65">The public function/variable qualifier</a></h4>
<p>
<a name="IDX70"></a>

</p>
<p>
This is the default qualifier for all functions. It means there is no
limits other than those which the language imposes on accessing, saving
and masking.

</p>


<h4><a name="SEC66" href="index.html#SEC66">The varargs function qualifier</a></h4>
<p>
<a name="IDX71"></a>

</p>
<p>
Sometimes you want a function to be able to receive a variable amount
of arguments. There's two ways of doing this and it can be discussed
if it's correct to put both explanations in this chapter, but it's
sort of logical to do so and not too hard to find.

</p>
<p>
A function that is defined <code>varargs</code> will be able to receive a
variable amount of arguments. The variables that aren't specified
at the call will be set to 0.

</p>

<pre>
varargs void
myfun(int a, string str, float c);
{
}
</pre>

<p>
The call <code>myfun(1);</code> will set <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>, <code>str</code> and 
<code>c</code> to <code>0</code>. Make sure you test the potentially unused variables
before you try to use them so that they do contain a value you can use.

</p>
<p>
There's another way as well. You can specify default values to the
variables that you're uncertain about. Then you don't have to declare
the function <code>varargs</code> and you will have proper default values
in the unused argument variables as well.

</p>

<pre>
void
myfun(int a, string str = &quot;pelle&quot;, float c = 3.0);
{
}
</pre>

<p>
This function must be called with at least one argument, the first, as
it wasn't given a default value. The call <code>myfun(1, &quot;apa&quot;);</code> will
set <code>a</code> to <code>1</code>, <code>str</code> to <code>&quot;apa&quot;</code> and <code>c</code> to 
<code>3.0</code>.

</p>


<h3><a name="SEC68" href="index.html#SEC68">switch/case part 2</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="IDX73"></a>
<a name="IDX74"></a>

</p>
<p>
The LPC switch statement is very intelligent, it can also use ranges in
integers:

</p>

<pre>
public void
wheel_of_fortune()
{
    int i;

    i = random(10);     /* Get a random number 0 - 9
                           Strictly speaking, this local variable isn't
                           necessary, it's just there to demonstrate the
                           use and make things clearer. I could have 
                           switched on 'random(10)' directly instead if
                           I had wanted to. */

    switch (i)
    {
    case 0..4:
        write(&quot;Try again, sucker!\n&quot;);
        break;

    case 5..6:
        write(&quot;Congrats, third prize!\n&quot;);
        break;

    case 7..8:
        write(&quot;Yes! Second prize!\n&quot;);
        break;

    case 9:
        write(&quot;WOOOOPS! You did it!\n&quot;);
        break;

    default:
        write(&quot;Someone has tinkered with the wheel... Call 911!\n&quot;);
        break;
    }
}
</pre>



<h3><a name="SEC69" href="index.html#SEC69">catch/throw: Error handling during runtime</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="IDX75"></a>

</p>
<p>
It happens now and then that you need to make function calls you know 
<i>might</i> result in a runtime error. For example you might try to
clone an object (described later) or read a file. If the files aren't
there or your privileges are wrong you will get a runtime error and
execution will stop. In these circumstances it is desireable to be able
to intercept the error and either display some kind of message or
perform other actions instead. The special LPC function operator
<code>catch()</code> will do this for you. It returns 1 (true) if an error
occurs during evaluation of the given function and 0 (false) otherwise.

</p>

<pre>
int catch(function)
e.g.
    if (catch(tail(&quot;/d/Relic/fatty/hidden_donut_map&quot;)))
    {
        write(&quot;Sorry, not possible to read that file.\n&quot;);
        return;
    }
</pre>

<p>
<a name="IDX76"></a>
It's also possible to cause error interrupts. This is particularly useful
when you want to notify the user of an unplanned for event that occured
during execution. Typically you want to do this in the 'default' case of a
switch statement, unless (naturally) you use default as a sort of catch-it-all
position. In any case <code>throw()</code> will generate a runtime error
with the message you specify. A <code>catch()</code> statement issued prior to
calling the function that uses <code>throw()</code> will naturally intercept the
error as usual.

</p>

<pre>
throw(mixed info)
e.g.
    if (test &lt; 5)
        throw(&quot;The variable 'test' is less than 5\n&quot;);
</pre>



<h3><a name="SEC70" href="index.html#SEC70">Array &amp; Mapping references</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="IDX77"></a>
<a name="IDX78"></a>

</p>
<p>
In comp sci terms, arrays and mappings are used as <b>reference by pointer</b>
and the other types as <b>reference by value</b>. This means that arrays and
mappings, unlike other variables, aren't copied every time they are moved
around. Instead, what is moved is a reference to the original array or
mapping. What does this mean then?

</p>
<p>
Well... simply this:

</p>

<pre>
object *arr, *copy_arr;

arr = ({ 1, 2, 3, 4 });    /* An array */

copy_arr = arr;	             /* Assume (wrongly) that a copy_arr becomes
                                a copy of arr. */

/* Change the first value (1) into 5. */
copy_arr[0] = 5;
</pre>

<p>
... Now... this far down the code it's logical to assume that the first
value of <code>copy_arr</code> is 5 while the first value or <code>arr</code> is 1.
That's not so however, because what got copied into <code>copy_arr</code> was
not the array itself, but a reference to the same array as <code>arr</code>.
This means that your operation later where you changed an element,
changed that element in the original array which both variables refer
to.  <code>copy_arr</code> and <code>arr</code> will both seem to have changed,
while in fact it was only the original array that both refered to that
changed.

</p>
<p>
Exactly the same thing will happen if you use mappings since they work
the same way in this respect.

</p>
<p>
So... how do you get around this then? I mean... most times you really want
to work on a copy and not the original array or mapping. The solution is
very simple actually. You just make sure that the copy is created from
another array or mapping instead.

</p>

<pre>
              _ This is just an empty array
             /
copy_arr = ({ }) + arr;
                    \_ This is the one we want to make unique
</pre>

<p>
In this example <code>copy_arr</code> becomes the sum of the empty array and
the <code>arr</code> array created as an entirely new array. This leaves
the original unchanged, just as we wanted. You can do exactly the same
thing with mappings. It doesn't matter if you add the empty array or
mapping first or last, just as long as you do it.

</p>

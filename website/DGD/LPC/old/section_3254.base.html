    <h2><a name="SEC3.2" href="index.html#SEC3.2">3.2 Basic LPC</a></h2>

    <p>
      LPC is similar to the language C, although some differences
      exist.  Experienced coders will find it is basically a
      simplified C with some new convenient types and new functions.
      Some inconsistancies exist but, as with C, they're not a problem
      if you're aware of them.
    </p>


    <h3><a name="SEC3.2.1" href="index.html#SEC3.2.1">Comments</a></h3>

    <p>
      Comments may seem like an odd thing to start with, but they're
      everywhere so you need to be able to recognize them from the
      very start.  They're also important, so you need to know how to
      write them from the very start.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some LPC dialects, there are two kinds of comments:

    <pre>
&lt;code&gt; // This is a comment stretching to the end of the line.
       // NOT SUPPORTED BY DGD!

&lt;code&gt; /* This is an enclosed comment */ &lt;more code&gt;
    </pre>

    The first type of comment starts off with the <code>//</code>
    characters and then stretches all the way to the end of the line.
    If you want more lines of comments, you'll have to start off those
    as well with new <code>//</code> characters.  This is like
    C++ single-line comments, and DGD does <i>not</i> support them!
  </p>

    <p>
      The second type has a definite length.  Those comments start
      with <code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. They are
      useful when you have to write something that will stretch over
      several lines.  You only have to write the comment symbol at
      then beginning and end, and not for every line in between.
      These are just like standard C comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the <code>/* */</code> comment can <i>not</i>
      be nested.  It is <i>not</i> correct to write something like
      this:

    <pre>
/* A comment
   /* A nested comment */
   the first continues
 */
    </pre>

    What will happen is that the comment will end with the first
    <code>*/</code> found, leaving the text <code>the first continues
    */</code> to be interpreted as if it was LPC code.  That's not
    valid LPC code, so instead you'll get an error.
  </p>


    <h3><a name="SEC3.2.2" href="index.html#SEC3.2.2">Data Types</a></h3>

    <p>
      An object holds information in <b>variables</b>.  Variables
      are a sort of virtual container that holds information.
      It's called a variable because the information is allowed to
      change later.  Most objects process information with
      <b>functions</b>.  Functions can use and return data of various kinds.
    </p>

    <p>
      In principle only one kind of data type is needed, a sort of
      general container that would hold anything you wanted it to.
      LPC calls this type 'mixed'.  Usually, though, it's much more
      useful if you can distinguish between different types of
      information.  Knowing what's in a variable can be a very good
      thing.  It <i>greatly</i> improves on the time it takes to write
      and debug an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      In LPC it is possible to use only data of type 'mixed'.  In the
      first versions of the language, that was the only data type
      available.  With modern LPC, however, it's better to avoid mixed
      variables when you can.
    </p>

    <p>
      LPC lets you declare variables of these types:

    <dl compact>
      <dt><tt>void</tt>
      <dd>
	Void is only used as the return type of functions that don't
	return any data at all.  You'll never declare a variable of
	type void, though you'll use it like other types.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>int</tt>
      <dd>
	Integers (LPC calls them 'int' for short) are whole numbers,
	normally between -2147483648 and 2147483647.  For instance 3,
	17, -32, and 999 are all perfectly good integers.  You can
	write integers in a couple of different ways, such as in
	hexadecimal (base 16), but they're still the same data type
	underneath, they're just written differently.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>float</tt>
      <dd>
        <p>
	Fractional numbers, usually approximately between
	1.17549435e-38 and 3.40282347e+38.  For instance 1.3, -348.4,
	2.0 and 4.53e+4 are floating-point numbers (LPC calls them
	'float').  In case you're not familiar with Scientific
	Notation for numbers, 4.53e+4 is the same as 4.53 x 10^4, 4.53
	* 10000, or 45300.
	</p>

	<p>
	LPC doesn't recognized numbers like <code>1.</code> or
	<code>.4711</code> as floats.  You have to specify both an
	integer and a decimal part for every number, even if they're
	zero for the number you're typing.  LPC's just funny that way.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>string</tt>
      <dd>
	Strings are simply a series of printable characters.  They're
	written with the characters in double quotes.  For instance
	&quot;x&quot;, &quot;the string&quot;, &quot;Another long
	string with the number 5 in it&quot;. Strings can contain
	special characters like newline (written as &quot;\n&quot;) to
	end a line. A lot of LPC operators can handle strings
	directly, unlike in C.  For instance, you can put two of them
	together with <code>+</code>.  This makes strings much easier
	to use.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>mapping</tt>
      <dd>
	Mappings are another handy LPC feature.  A mapping is simply a
	list of associated values. Assume you want to remember the
	ages of people.  Say that Olle is 23, Peter is 54 and Anna is
	15.  In LPC you can turn this into the mapping <code>([
	"Olle":23, "Peter":54, "Anna":15 ])</code>.  The value to the
	right has been associated to the key to the left. You can then
	find the value by looking for the key.  DGD lets you do
	intersections and unions and other operations on mappings.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>object</tt>
      <dd>
	Object pointers are references to LPC programs that have been
	loaded into memory.  The object pointer may point to an original
	object, or to a clone.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>Array</tt>
      <dd>
	All of the above can appear in arrays, indicated by a
	<code>*</code> in front of the variable name in the
	declaration.

	Arrays in LPC are more like lists than arrays in C.  LPC and
	DGD let you do unions and intersections and other array
	operations that most languages don't.
      </dd>

      <dt><tt>mixed</tt>
      <dd>
	Type mixed is a general descriptor covering all the others, a
	sort of jack-of-all-trades type.  An object of any other type
	may be stored within a mixed type.

	But when a regular type can be used, it should. Don't use
	mixed just because you don't want to remember the type's name.
	The type system is there to catch errors for you.  Let it.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      There's also a special value called <code>nil</code>, which is
      not really any of the types above.  A string, mapping, array or
      mixed variable that isn't initialized has a value of nil.  A
      freshly-allocated array is often allocated to nil.  You can do
      some tricks like assigning nil to an entry in a mapping to
      remove it.  Nil is like an undefined value, or a zero for things
      that aren't necessarily numbers.  You'll see more of it in
      examples later on.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need to know the limits of integers, characters or
      floating-point numbers, you can check DGD's
      <tt>include/limits.h</tt> and <tt>include/float.h</tt> files.
      They list limits of the various data types.  Bear in mind that
      DGD can easily be compiled with different integer and floating
      point limits, so it's good to make your code check the sizes.
      They may be different next time your program runs!
    </p>


    <h3><a name="SEC3.2.3" href="index.html#SEC3.2.3">
	Variable declarations</a></h3>

    <p>
      A variable is a string of letters identifying an information
      container, a place to store data. The container is given a name
      consisting of 32 characters or less, starting with a letter.  No
      special character other than the '_' used to separate words is
      ever used. Variables should always be given names that reflect
      how they are used. You declare variables like this:

    <pre>
&lt;data type&gt; &lt;variable name&gt;, &lt;another variable&gt;, ..., &lt;last variable&gt;;
e.g.
    int        counter;
    float      height, weight;
    mapping    age_map;
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Variables must be declared at the beginning of a block,
      immediately after the first <code>{</code> and before any other
      statements. Global variables, variables that are available in
      all functions througout the program, should be declared at the
      top of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Variables are initially set to 0 or to nil, and not necessarily
      to the obvious 'empty' values.  Mappings, arrays and strings
      will all be set to nil and not to <code>([])</code>,
      <code>({})</code> or <code>""</code> as you might expect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arrays and mappings should be initalized to their empty values
      (<code>({})</code> and <code>([])</code> respectively) before
      being used.  You can't add a value to a mapping that's set to
      nil, for instance, and you'll get a runtime error if you try.
    </p>


    <h3><a name="SEC3.2.4" href="index.html#SEC3.2.4">
	Function declarations</a></h3>

    <p>
      A function's declaration must state what kind of data type it
      returns, if any.  A function name is a label much like a
      variable name, consisting of 32 characters or less and starting
      with a letter.  No special characters other than <code>_</code>
      should be used to separate words. Use function names that
      clearly reflect on what they do. A function declaration looks
      like this:

    <pre>
/*
 * Function name: &lt;Function name&gt;
 * Description:   &lt;What it does &gt;
 * Arguments:     <A list of the arguments and what they contain>
 * Returns:       &lt;What the function returns&gt;
 */
&lt;return type&gt;
&lt;function name&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;)
{
   &lt;code expressions&gt;
}
    </pre>
    The beginning comment, while optional, is highly recommended.
    Even if you don't use precisely this form of comment, you should
    state what the function does and what it expects to be given as
    input.  Here is an example function:
    <pre>
/*
 * Function name: compute_diam
 * Description:   Compute the diameter of a circle given the 
 *                circumference.
 * Variables:     circumference - the circle's circumference
 *                pi - a famous irrational constant
 * Returns:       The circle's diameter
 */
float compute_diam(float circumference, float pi)
{
    float rval;

    /* Circumference = pi * diameter, so
       diameter = circumference / pi */

    rval = circumference / pi;

    return rval;
}
</pre>
  </p>

    <p>
      The argument list is a comma-separated list of data types.  It
      specifies what kinds of data will be sent to the function and
      assigns names to this data for later use.  The data recieved
      will <i>only</i> be usable inside the function, unless you
      explicitly send it elsewhere.  The function's argument names are
      valid only within that function itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      (In order to save space and improve on legibility in the text,
      I won't put a header on every example function).
    </p>

    <p>
      A function that doesn't return anything should be declared as
      <code>void</code>.  For instance:
    <pre>
void write_stuff(string mess)
{
    write_file("/usr/Bob/myfile.txt", mess);
}
    </pre>
  </p>

    <h3><a name="SEC3.2.5" href="index.html#SEC3.2.5">
	Statements and Expressions</a></h3>

    <p>
      We need to define what a <b>statement</b> and what an
      <b>expression</b> are in order to proceed.
    </p>


    <h4><a name="SEC3.2.5.1" href="index.html#SEC3.2.5.1">
	Statements</a></h4>

    <p>
      <a name="IDX10"></a>
      <a name="IDX11"></a>

      A statement is sort of a full sentence of instructions, made up
      from one or more expressions. Statements usually cover no more
      than a single line of code. Sometimes it's necessary to break it
      up though if it becomes too long simply to improve on legibility
      -- a little like avoiding long run-on sentences.  For most
      statements you simply break the line between two words, but if
      you are in the middle of a string you need to add a backslash
      (<code>\</code>) at the end of the line in order for the
      gamedriver to understand what's going on.

    </p>

    <pre>
DRIVER->message("This is an example of \
a broken string.\n");
    </pre>

    <p>
      However, breaking a statement with backslash is extremely ugly
      and makes the code hard to read.  It's usually possible to break
      the line naturally at the end of a string, or between two
      operators of some kind, or even just split the string in half
      and add the two parts together with the <code>+</code>
      operator. The only time the backslash really is necessary is in
      <code>#define</code>-statements, which we'll mention later.
    </p>

<pre>
DRIVER->message("This is a better way of " +
                "breaking a string.\n");
</pre>

    <p>
      Statements in LPC almost always end with <code>;</code>.  It's
      considered good practice to put a newline there as well.
      That is to say, you shouldn't put multiple statements on the same
      line if you can help it.  Keeping them separate makes them easier
      to read.
    </p>


    <h4><a name="SEC3.2.5.2" href="index.html#SEC3.2.5.2">
	Expressions</a></h4>

    <p>
      An expression is an instruction or set of instructions that
      results in a value.  A variable is an
      expression since it yields its contents as a result.  <code>a +
      b</code> is a valid expression, because <code>a</code> and
      <code>b</code> are variables (expressions) and <code>+</code> is
      an operator that takes two expressions to make another
      expression.  <code>a = b + c;</code> is a full statement ending
      in a <code>;</code>.  Because the <code>=</code> operator
      returns a value, <code>a = b + c</code> is an expression, but
      when you add a <code>;</code>, it becomes a statement.  It's
      like when you add a period to the end of a bunch of words and
      suddenly you have a sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Function calls are valid expressions. They are written simply as
      the name followed by a set of parentheses with the arguments
      that the functions uses listed inside.  Take the simple function
      <code>max()</code> for example, that returns the maximum of the
      two floating-point arguments.  To determine the maximum of
      <code>4.0</code> and <code>10.0</code>, you would write
      <code>max(4.0, 10.0)</code> as the expression.  The result of
      the function call must be stored or used in an expression, or it
      is lost.  That's fine if you're calling the function because of
      some other effect it has, such as <code>write_file()</code>.
    </p>


    <h4><a name="SEC3.2.5.3" href="index.html#SEC3.2.5.3">
	The block statement</a></h4>
    <p>
      <a name="IDX12"></a>

      There are a lot of statements such as conditional statements
      that in certain circumstances execute only <i>one</i> specified
      statement and no more.  Suppose you want to have several
      statements executed and not just one? Well, there's a special
      statement called <b>block</b> statement that will allow you to
      do that. A block is defined as starting with a <code>{</code>
      and ending with a <code>}</code>. Within that block you may have
      as many statements of any kind (including variable definitions)
      as you like.  The block statement shouldn't end with a
      <code>;</code>, though usually it doesn't matter if you
      accidentally put one there.  Example:
    <pre>
if(my_var < 3)
{
  statement_one();
  statement_two();
  statement_three();
}
    </pre>
  </p>


    <h4><a name="SEC3.2.5.4" href="index.html#SEC3.2.5.4">
	The ';' statement</a></h4>

    <p>
      As stated <code>;</code> is mostly used to terminate statements.
      However it's also a statement in its own right.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>;</code> on it's own will simply be a null statement
      causing nothing to happen. This is useful when you have
      test-clauses and loops (described later) that perform their
      intended purpose within the test or loop clause and aren't
      actually intended to do anything else.  Just remember that
      anywhere you're allowed to have a statement, you can just
      put a <code>;</code> as a statement that does nothing.
    </p>

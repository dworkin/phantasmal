  Conditions</a></h1>

  <p>This tutorial was produced in good faith for use by people who
  like to program muds for their own pleasure. That means that I
  won't charge for using or distributing it provided that this
  <em>is</em> the purpose it's being used for.</p>

  <p>Specifically, I want to make sure that those who run
  commercial muds don't provide this manual as an aid to further
  their monetary aims. If they want it they can either pay me a lot
  of money for it or produce one of their own.</p>

  <p>Please read the copyright statement in the printed section of
  this manual to get the full text. The gist of it, however, is
  exactly what I just related here.</p>

  <p><i>Angelbob's Addendum:</i> I agree with what he said, though
  I don't personally care whether my stuff is used commercially.
  However, the copyright stands as written -- I'm only allowed to
  redistribute a modified version under Ronny Wikh's terms, and I
  wouldn't dream of violating them. The full copyright is
  reproduced below.</p>

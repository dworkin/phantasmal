<h2>DGD's Swapping Behavior</h2>

<p>DGD calls itself a "disk-based" server. That means that DGD will
swap out objects after they've been unused for awhile. It uses a
standard LRU (Least Recently Used) metric to determine which
objects should be removed from memory. This swapping is entirely
transparent from the point of view of the LPC code. All LPC code
executes as though every object was in RAM at all times, and
objects will be pulled into memory as they are referenced.</p>

<h3>The Configuration File</h3>

<p>DGD's configuration file contains a parameter called
swap_fragment. That's the fraction of all objects that should be
removed from memory. For instance, if swap_fragment is equal to 20,
then one-twentieth of all objects will be swapped out at the end of
every execution round. A smaller swap_fragment will cause DGD to
use less memory at a time, but will also mean more disk access
happens after each execution round as objects are written to
disk.</p>

<p>Objects are stored on disk as sectors. The sector_size parameter
tells DGD how large a single sector is, in bytes. Every object
takes up a multiple of the sector size in the swap file. So if the
sector size were 1024, no object could take less than one kilobyte
to store in the swap file. An object with 3217 bytes of data would
wind up actually taking 4096 bytes in the swap file, or four
sectors. A small sector size can save some space that way, though a
very small sector size (like, say, 64 bytes) will require the DGD
server to use up a lot of processor time and memory in managing so
many sectors.</p>

<p>The swap_cache config parameter says how many sectors can be in
RAM at once. If this is large, DGD runs fast. If it's small, DGD
takes less memory.</p>

<h3>Transparency</h3>

<p>All of this nifty swapping stuff Just Happens(tm). That is, you
should never, as a programmer, specifically need to request it.
Objects are swapped out at the end of execution rounds according to
the swap_fragment configuration parameter, and they're swapped in
when you use them. It should never be necessary to explicitly
request a swap-in for an object - just call a function of the
object, even if that function doesn't exist, and the object will be
swapped in.</p>

<p>If you ever wish to explicitly request a swap-out, there's a
kfun called swapout() which will swap <i>every</i> object out. The
function will take effect at the end of the execution round that
requested it.</p>

<p>An object is swapped back into memory when one of its functions
is called. Just the first sector will be swapped in when status()
is called on the object. Note that calling find_object() does not
swap the object in. Only operations that access the object's
individual information need to do so.</p>

<p>When an object is swapped out, it will only be written out if it
changes. Having large objects that change frequently can make for
much slower swapping. Consider separating the highly-changeable
parts of the objects into smaller DGD objects that will swap
separately.</p>

<h3>Memory Use</h3>

<p>You'll find that the in-RAM memory use of your library, measured
in sectors, is driven by several things. Roughly in order of
importance, those things are: 1) the number of rooms and portable
items in your world. 2) The time your MUD has been running &mdash;
DGD is disk-based, so content is loaded as it is visited. 3) The
number of active, moving users. Active users will continue to load
content by seeing and using it. It would otherwise be swapped out.
And 4) the aggressiveness of your cleanup routines, including
things like swapping. The more aggressively you clean up, the
shorter the time that 'transient' memory (memory that is used
briefly and discarded) will take up space after it is used.</p>

<h3>Disabling Swapping</h3>

<p>If you experience very high usage by your MUD of your machine's
CPU, but DGD's usage of ticks doesn't account for it, then DGD's
housekeeping tasks, especially swapping, may account for the
difference. If your MUD can fit entirely in RAM, you can find out
if swapping is your problem by temporarily turning off swapping and
only using RAM.</p>

<p>In your DGD configuration file, set swap_fragment to 0. That
will turn off ordinary swapping, but not certain operations where
all objects are swapped out to make room for larger contiguous
blocks of static memory. By setting static_chunk to 0 as well, you
can entirely eliminate all swapping in your application.</p>

<p>Remember to turn swapping back on afterward!</p>

<h3>Massive Numbers of Objects</h3>

<p>For lots of objects, you'll have to first increase the maximum
number of objects and maximum number of sectors in the DGD
configuration file. Both are quite small initially. DGD was
initially designed to run in as little as a single megabyte of
memory, so its starting configuration isn't appropriate for large
MUDs. You'll have to change the file a bit.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is essentially no penalty for have a very large
maximum number of objects, at least if you have the disk space to
permit it and the RAM to hold the ones that are currently in
memory.</p>

<p>The maximum number of possible objects depends on your operating
system and your version of DGD. But remember that your swapfile
will have to be no larger than the largest file your operating
system supports. That can be as small as 2GB or smaller for some
operating systems. Also, with the default data type for object
numbers, you can't have more than 4 billion objects total. You can
change that limit, but it would require significant effort.</p>

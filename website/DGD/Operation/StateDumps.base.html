<h2>DGD's State Dumps</h2>

<p>Statedumps provide a way to dump DGD's memory space to disk,
much as the swapfile does, and restore it at a later time. All
program state is maintained. Pointers continue to work, call_out()
statements are still scheduled, objects that are previously
un-upgraded remain that way until recompiled in the standard DGD
way. The only difference after a statedump is that network
connections are broken (of course), and that you can alter the code
of the DGD server, perhaps by upgrading versions or changing the
configuration file. Statedumps are almost invariably forward
compatible to new stable DGD versions, and there are several other
upgrades you can make, such as increasing the maximum number of
objects, which will be transparently caught and permitted with an
old statedump file.</p>

<p>A statedump makes the old save_object() and restore_object()
functions redundant for saving your MUD's state as a whole, though
they can occasionally be useful for saving an individual object or
three. Like with save_object(), the resulting statedump file can
contain security-sensitive information, so it should ideally be
stored where only highly-privileged code can read it.</p>

<p>Statedumps are a highly-necessary part of <a href=
"../LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistence</a> in a MUD Library.
Skotos Tech's Castle Marrach used them since early development,
keeping a 'virtual uptime' from 1999 into 2004 and beyond.</p>

<p>Statedumps, like shutdowns and object recompilation, take place
immediately after the thread that requested them has ended. The
thread that would otherwise immediately follow will occur, but not
until after the server has been restarted with the just-saved
statedump.</p>

<p>Statedumps are able to handle DGD's normal policy of having
<a href="Swapping.html">far more LPC data than there is available
memory</a>. Normally, a swapfile will be written incrementally as
objects are swapped out. You can tell DGD when to put the finishing
touches on it, declare it done, and that becomes your statedump.
Your swapfile will then begin writing out (what will be) the next
incremental statedump. By telling DGD approximately how often
you'll be dumping state, you make it much easier for the server to
write the statedump in a timely way when you request it &mdash;
nearly all the work has been done in advance. However, it can be
very difficult to guarantee the time taken to write a statedump for
a large MUD, depending on what objects have or have not been
swapped out recently.</p>

<p>Statedumps are, generally speaking, the fastest way to do
backups in DGD. You should use them regularly for that purpose, in
case your game crashes. Castle Marrach's statedump, circa 2004, was
nearly 2GB in size. Its statedump usually took only a few seconds,
only occasionally going into the 10-20 seconds range. That's not a
lot of time required, so backing up (say) every hour won't cause
your MUD a lot of lag.</p>

<h3>Restoring</h3>

<p>When you restore from a statedump, all your previous objects are
exactly where they were. However, your network connections, if any,
have been closed. You should destruct them if it's necessary to do
so explicitly. See the Kernel Library's code for details, or use
the Kernel Library to make even that part of restoration fully
transparent.</p>

<h3>Cleanup</h3>

<p>A certain amount of object fragmentation is removed and other
cleanup tasks done when objects are swapped out. For that reason,
it's often good to make sure that DGD is permitted to do at least
some <a href="Swapping.html">swapping</a> rather than running your
game entirely in RAM.</p>

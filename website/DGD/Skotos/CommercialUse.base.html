<h2>Licensing DGD Commercially</h2>

<p>Licensing DGD from Dworkin, at this point, costs about
$100,000.00 US per year. No, that's not a misprint. Yes, it's well
out of hobbyist range. You can get a cheaper price if you're a
nonprofit organization, or under some similar conditions, but it's
still not particularly cheap. Before you send horrendous angry mail
to Dworkin about how greedy he is, <i>please</i> read further. He
originally licensed at a much lower cost, and it didn't work <i>at
all</i>. He has already tried the approach you're going to suggest.
No, I'm not thrilled with the current situation either.</p>

<p>You can potentially get a much lower price through Skotos,
depending on whether you compete with them, whether you're willing
to contribute code back to them, and how they choose to work with
you. The basic license agreement that they have involves
(involved?) paying $75,000, or $25,000 per year &mdash; still well
below the cost to directly license DGD through Felix. Their
license-discounting scheme is at best semi-public, but some
licensing agreements that they've had in the past are known.</p>

<p>In any case, Skotos has been willing to deal in the past, so if
you think you're not far off being able to pay the license fee, or
mostly noncompeting, or otherwise an "almost" case, talking to
Christopher Allen could be a wise move.</p>

<h3>Other Licensing Conditions</h3>

<p>Skotos may consider licensing to you cheaper if you don't
compete with their business. Their business is games, and more
specifically MUDs, so your MUD probably <i>does</i> compete with
their business. They're unlikely to give you a seriously cheap DGD
license for a commercial MUD. However, they might choose to work
with you directly, which is an entirely different agreement.</p>

<p>Skotos has, in the past, been willing to give very cheap use of
DGD to those who work with their libraries and contribute code
back. They also have an in-house plan for developing games which
will run on Skotos servers, using DGD commercially. The idea is
that the DGD license is supplied free, because Skotos is the one
using it. The developer (you) will be paid a royalty based on the
number of subscribers your game draws to Skotos' site, as measured
by the amount of time and the number of people that your game has
at any given time. If your game is sufficiently popular, you get
royalties. Those are split between the implementor(s) and head
builder(s) in a prearranged way. If you're using licensed
intellectual property like Chaosium's Lovecraft Country in your
game, the royalties are proportionally lower.</p>

<p>Your chances of becoming rich off their royalty payments is
very, very low. However, it's a way to develop a commercial MUD,
running on commercial servers, for nothing out-of-pocket to you.
They are offering a free-but-unlikely chance to get rich at no
charge, so you can think of it as a free lottery ticket they've
just given you. Unfortunately, unlike a lottery ticket, you'll need
to write a MUD and run it for awhile before they see if your
numbers match :-)</p>

<p>Note that any changes you make to the underlying Skotos lib, or
that builds in a non-game-specific way on top of it, will need to
be submitted back to Skotos for possible inclusion in the base
library. You may believe that that's unfair, and that if they're
not going to give you any guaranteed payments, they should get
nothing from you except whatever business you drum up. The Skotos
response is basically that 1) licensing DGD costs them a lot of
money, 2) running the servers costs them a lot of money, and 3)
your game doesn't make them a lot of money. If it did, you'd be
getting lots of royalties.</p>

<h3>Technical Capabilities</h3>

<p>The commercial version of DGD has a couple of nonstandard
capabilities, but they're basically outmatched by the network
patch, so it's nothing extraordinary. In general, free DGD has the
same feature set as commercial DGD.</p>

<h3>Why So Expensive?</h3>

<p>Before 1996 (yes, DGD is <i>old</i>), commercial licensing for
DGD cost $100 per month. To quote Dworkin:</p>
<pre>
Before 1996, a commercial license for DGD was $100 a month.  I
received hundreds of emails from interested people.  Upon learning the
terms for a commercial license, they would generally say, "gee,
that's $1200 per year.  Can we maybe work out some royalty deal?"
Others would say that the terms were fine, tell me that they'd already
started developing a new mudlib, and then they'd fade away.  Nobody,
out of all these hundreds, ever paid me a cent.  Meanwhile, I had my
own bills to pay.

I have come to see the response to the $100 a month license as
symptomatic for the text MUD "industry".  Almost everyone
who contacted me severely underestimated the difficulty of creating
your own MUD, didn't know how to run a business, and was unwilling to
invest $1200 for the first year to get their MUD running.

Then I got involved with ichat.  They were in the $100,000+ per year
licensing league.  Using DGD and 2 LPC programmers, they created ROOMS
and in 6 months they had 80% of the chat market.

Even if I were able at this point to live on DGD income through the
$100 per month market (which I doubt), I believe that, considering the
lack of professionalism of many people in that group, I would be
spending a lot of my time dealing with contract violations and
non-payment of fees, instead of programming.  I consider DGD to be a
professional, high-quality product.  I would much rather deal with
those in the $100,000/year league.

Subject: [DGD] SkotOS 2.0

Hey folks,

I promised you a summary of the SkotOS mudlib this weekend. I've had 
less time than I wished, so this is draft status and incomplete, but it 
is still by far the most comprehensive summary we've ever posted anywhere:

Please excuse the broken links at the top; I'm generating this through 
Doxygen without uploading the auxiliary files.

More later,
Zell

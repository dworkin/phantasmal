<h2>What is Known About the Skotos Libraries?</h2>

<p>Skotos' current libraries are closed-source. However, some
information has been released by the company about them. You can
find some of the information in the <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos articles</a>, especially Shannon
Appelcline's "Trials, Triumphs and Trivialities".</p>

<p>The Skotos library includes a web interface for administration
and creation. The basic library includes everything one might need
for the base of a next-generation mud. This includes true <a href=
"../LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistence</a>, and a more
extensive social expression mechanism than even MUSHes contain. The
base Skotos library does <i>not</i> have game-specific systems like
combat, though. Those are built individually, per-game.</p>

<p>There is also XML object import and export. You can see examples
of an <a href="../external/skotos_anvil.txt">anvil</a> and a
<a href="../external/skotos_rose.txt">rose</a> rendered as XML from
their Skotos LPC objects.</p>

<p>Skotos has provided an <a href="Intro_to_SAM.html">introduction
to their Skotos Active Markup syntax</a>. There's also a <a href=
"SAM_Quick_Summary.html">quick summary of all the tags</a> for
their markup.</p>

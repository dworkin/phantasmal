<h2>What is Known About the Skotos Libraries?</h2>

<p>Skotos' current libraries are closed-source. However, some
information has been released by the company about them. You can find
some of the information in the <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos
articles</a>, especially Shannon Appelcline's "Trials, Triumphs and
Trivialities".</p>

<p>The Skotos library includes a web interface for administration and
creation. The basic library includes everything one might need for the
base of a next-generation mud. This includes true <a href=
"../LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistence</a>, and a more extensive
social expression mechanism than even MUSHes contain. The base Skotos
library does <i>not</i> have game-specific systems like combat, though.
Those are built individually, per-game.</p>

<p>There is also XML object import and export. You can see examples of
an <a href="../external/skotos_anvil.txt">anvil</a> and a <a href=
"../external/skotos_rose.txt">rose</a> rendered as XML from their Skotos
LPC objects.</p>

<p>Skotos has provided an <a href="Intro_to_SAM.html">introduction to
their Skotos Active Markup syntax</a>. There's also a <a href=
"SAM_Quick_Summary.html">quick summary of all the tags</a> for their
markup.</p>

@@TITLE Quick SAM Summary@@

<h2>Quick Summary of the Skotos SAM System</h2>

<p>SAM (Skotos Active Markup) allows text in descriptions (see
Quick Summary: Description System) to be dynamic.</p>

<h3>OneOf</h3>

<p>The simplest SAM is the OneOf -- basically using a OneOf in your
text allows you to randomize the output.</p>
<pre>
   Look: [
      You are inside {a large|an oversize|a} tent.
   ]
   Output(s):
      &gt; look at tent
      You are inside a large tent.
      &gt; look at tent
      You are inside an oversize tent
      &gt; look at tent
      You are inside a tent.
      &gt;
</pre>

<h3>Output a Property</h3>

<p>You can also output the value of a property very easily.</p>
<pre>
   Look: [
      The gem is $(this.gemcolor).
   ]
   Output(s):
      &gt; look at gem
      The gem is blue.
      &gt; +setp gem "gemcolor green
      Setting 'gemcolor' in &lt;[Examples:complete:sam:gem]#4544&gt; to "green".
      &gt; look at gem
      The gem is green.
      &gt;
</pre>

<p>In the above example, $(this) refers to the object itself, the
gem itself. $(this.gemcolor) refers to the value of the property
"gemcolor" inside the gem.</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>$(this) is only one of many 'arguments' that SAM knows about
that is different depending on the circumstance that the SAM is
executed.</p>

<p>In almost every situation, the following arguments are
available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(actor) &ndash; The object executing the action, e.g.
  whomever is taking the sword</li>

  <li>$(action) &ndash; The name of the action currently executing,
  e.g. take</li>

  <li>$(this) &ndash; The object containing the SAM itself, e.g.
  the sword</li>

  <li>$(target) &ndash; The detail of the object that is the target
  of the action.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, in many situations, the following additional
arguments are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(verb) &ndash; The verb used in the action, e.g. 'polish' in
  "polish the sword with my cloth"</li>

  <li>$(dob) &ndash; The object that is the direct object of the
  action, e.g. the sword</li>

  <li>$(using) &ndash; the object that is the indirect object of
  the action, e.g. the cloth</li>
</ul>

<h3>References</h3>

<p>In addition to arguments, you can also reference specific
objects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(Full:Woe:Name) &ndash; the object with the woe name
  "Full:Woe:Name"</li>

  <li>$[${Full:Woe:Name}] &ndash; the object that is currently
  named "Full:Woe:Name", and if the object is renamed, the
  reference will change with it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Property References</h3>

<p>Once you have object defined, either by argument $this or by
reference $(Full:Woe:Name) or $[${Full:Woe:Name}], you can directly
output the value of properties that are in these objects into your
descriptions, just by adding a period followed by the property
name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(this.trait:variant)</li>

  <li>$(actor.trait:variant)</li>

  <li>$(Full:Woe:Name.trait:variant)</li>

  <li>$[${Full:Woe:Name.trait:variant}]</li>
</ul>

<p>Some commonly used properties that output text:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(this.base:possessive) &ndash; possessive pronoun e.g.
  'his'</li>

  <li>$(this.base:objective) &ndash; objective pronoun e.g.
  'him'</li>

  <li>$(this.base:pronoun) &ndash; basic pronoun e.g. 'he'</li>

  <li>$(this.base:light-category) &ndash; object's luminosity, e.g.
  "dark", "dim", or "bright"</li>

  <li>$(this.details:default:description:brief) &ndash; object's
  default brief description</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of use:</p>
<pre>
   Look: [
      $(this.base:pronoun) looks very fierce. A scar runs from
$(this.base:possessive) cheek to $(this.base:possessive) chin, which doesn't
seem to bother $(this.base:objective).
   ]
   Output:
      &gt; look at warrior
      She looks very fierce. A scar runs from her cheek to her chin, which
doesn't seem to bother her.
      &gt;

   Look: [
      You are in a $(this.base:light-category) room.
   ]
   Output:
      &gt; look
      You are in a dim room.
      &gt;
</pre>

<p>Some property references don't output text, but instead refer to
other objects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(this.base:environment) &ndash; object's environment</li>

  <li>$(this.base:worn-by) &ndash; object's wearer (same as
  wielded-by)</li>

  <li>$(this.base:wielded-by &ndash; object's wielder (same as
  worn-by)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not that useful to use directly, but in turn you can
then use properties with these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(this.base:environment.base:possessive) &ndash; object's
  environment possessive pronoun</li>

  <li>$(this.base:worn-by.base:pronoun) &ndash; object's wearer's
  basic pronoun</li>
</ul>

<p>Details of objects can be output:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$("this.details:default:descriptions:look") &ndash; the prime
  detail's look description</li>

  <li>$("this.details:lamp:descriptions:brief") &ndash; the lamp
  detail's brief description</li>
</ul>

<p>Some detail IDs have spaces in them. The way to refer to a SAM
reference with a space in it is to put it in quotes &ndash;
e.g.</p>

<ul>
  <li>$("this.details:exit west:descriptions:look") &ndash; the
  look description of exit west</li>
</ul>

<p>rather than</p>

<ul>
  <li>$(room.details:exit west:descriptions:look) &ndash; won't
  work</li>
</ul>

<h3>XHTML Tags</h3>

<p>There are some XHTML formatting tags that can be useful are are
available in SAM</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;br/&gt; &ndash; a line break, a single newline</li>

  <li>&lt;sbr&gt; &ndash; single break, inserts &lt;br/&gt; when
  used in a webpage, or a newline when used elsewhere.</li>

  <li>&lt;p/&gt; &ndash; a paragraph break, two newlines</li>

  <li>&lt;pre&gt;text&lt;/pre&gt; &ndash; will output the text in a
  monospace font, without formatting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Sam Tags</h3>

<p>There are various times when you need specific output that is
not easily available in a property, or the property is in the wrong
form. These SAM tags can be useful in these cases:</p>

<p>These are Sam Tags for describing things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;describe what="$(this)"/&gt; &ndash; This will output the
  brief of $(this) object, e.g. "a sword"</li>

  <li>&lt;describemany what="$(this.base:inventory)"/&gt; &ndash;
  Describe many will output multiple briefs, as if in an inventory,
  of the objects in $(this.base:inventory).</li>

  <li>&lt;describe-holder what="$(this)"/&gt; &ndash; Equivalent to
  &lt;describe what="$(foo.base:holder)"/&gt;'s except when the
  person's name ends in 's' or 'x' in which case it does the right
  thing and just adds the apostrophe without a trailing s.</li>

  <li>&lt;describe-poss what="$(this)"&gt; &ndash; Describes
  $(this) in the possessive form, e.g. "his sword"</li>

  <li>&lt;describe-prop this="$(this)" what="property:name"/&gt;
  &ndash; Adds "a" "the" "an" to the text of the property
  appropriately.</li>

  <li>*&lt;describe-view view="$(this)" cap/&gt; &ndash; Will give
  the full description of the object, including any visible
  inventory. e.g. "A tall orc, weilding his sword."</li>

  <li>&lt;capitalize what="lower"&gt; &ndash; will initial
  capitalize the text "lower" into "Lower"</li>

  <li>&lt;eaten what="$(this)"/&gt; &ndash; will output how much of
  the item has been consumed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these description Sam Tags have a variety of options,
see SamSystem for details, but one of the most useful ones is the
'cap' option, which will capitalize the output. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;describe what="$(this)"/&gt; &ndash; This will output the
  brief of $(this) object, e.g. "A sword"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client Sam</h3>

<p>The following SAM tags are useful for special features in the
Alice and Zealous clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&lt;atag tag="command"&gt; text that you want themed with the
  color in the 'command' theme &lt;/atag&gt;</li>

  <li>&lt;acmd tag="command" cmd="open west door"&gt;click here to
  open the west door.&lt;/acmd&gt;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simple If Comparison</h3>

<p>A simple if statement allows you to output one text if something
is true, a different text if false.</p>
<pre>
   Look: [
      A statue of a man. The statue's face {? this.trait:expression |appears
to be $(this.trait:expression) at you. |is expressionless. }
   ]
   Result(s):
      &gt; look at statue
      A statue of a man. The statue's face is expressionless.
      &gt; +setp statue "trait:expression smiling
      Setting 'trait:expression' in &lt;[Examples:complete:sam:statue]#4586&gt; to
"smiling".
      &gt; look at statue
      A statue of a man. The statue's face appears to be smiling at you.
      &gt;
</pre>

<p>In this example, if the property trait:expression doesn't exist
(i.e. false), then "is expressionless" is output. If it does exist
(true) then it is "appears to be smiling at you" will be
output.</p>

<h3>Other Comparisons</h3>

<p>There are quite a few kinds of comparisons you can do in
SAM:</p>
<pre>
BOOLEAN

    {? | $this.trait:variant |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? not | $this.trait:variant |
        true text output |
        false text output }
    {? equal | $this.trait:variant | ordinary |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? notequal | $this.trait:variant | ordinary |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? lessthen | $this.trait:variant | ordinary |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? lessthenorequal | $this.trait:variant | ordinary |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? greaterthen | $this.trait:variant | ordinary |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? greaterthenorequal | $this.trait:variant | ordinary |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? range | $this.trait:variant | lowervalue | uppervalue |
        true text output |
        false text output }
    
    Comment: range is exclusive, i.e. 
         {? range | 1 | 3 | 6 | true | false }"
            1   false
            2   false
            3   false
            3.1 true
            4   true
            5   true
            6   true
            6.1 false
            7   false
            8   false
            9   false


    {? when | $this.trait.variant |
        value1 | value1 equal $this.trait:variant |
        value2 | value2 equal $this.trait:variant |
        value3 | value2 equal $this.trait:variant |
        *      | any other value }
</pre>

<h3>Inline Merry</h3>

<p>You can put Merry scripts inside of of SAM as follows:</p>
<pre>
   Look: [
      You are on a road. There are $[this.stars_in_sky + this.moons_in_sky]
celestial bodies above you.
   ]
</pre>

<p>If the piece of Merry does not end in a semi-colon or a
right-brace, it is assumed to be a 'statement' rather than an
'expression'. This means the code needs to explicitly return a
value. For example,</p>
<pre>
   You are on a road. There are
     $[
         if (this.stars_in_sky &gt; 5) {
             return "lots of";
         }
         if (this.stars_in_sky &gt; 0) {
             return "a few";
         }
         return "no";
      ]
   stars in the sky.
</pre>

<h3>Inline Merry and Text</h3>

<p>It can often be useful in SAM to manipulate text, so there are
some very simple inline Merry functions that can perform this for
you.</p>

<p>Text related:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$[capitalize("this is a test")] &ndash; result: "This is a
  test"</li>

  <li>$[proper("This is a test")] &ndash; result: "This Is A
  Test"</li>

  <li>$[decapitalize("This Is A Test")] &ndash; result: "this Is A
  Test"</li>

  <li>$[upper_case("This Is A Test")] &ndash; result: "THIS IS A
  TEST"</li>

  <li>$[lower_case("this Is A Test")] &ndash; result: "this is a
  test"</li>
</ul>

<p>Number related:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$[desc_cardinal(128)] &ndash; result: "one hundred
  twenty-eight"</li>

  <li>$[desc_ordinal(128)] &ndash; result: "one hundred
  twenty-eighth"</li>

  <li>$[comma(1024)] &ndash; result: "1,024"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inline Merry and Comparisons</h3>

<p>You can combine arbitrary Merry expressions for tests to use in
comparisons, to make very sophisticated output. For example:</p>
<pre>
    {? | $[this.foo == "bar"] |
        true text output |
        false text output }

    {? | $[random(100)] |
        true one in 100 times. |
        false text output }

    {? | $[random(6)+random(6)+random(6)+3 == 18] |
        You rolled 3 sixes! |
        You didn't roll 3 sixes. }

    {? range | $[random(100)] | 25 | 75 |
        You rolled in the middle of the range. |
        You rolled outside the range. }
</pre>

<p>These can be quite sophisticated, for instance:</p>
<pre>
    {? | $[sizeof(Match($actor, "cigarette"))] |
    Actor has a cigarette. | Actor doesn't have cigarette. }
       Actor has a cigarette.
       Actor doesn't have a cigarette
</pre>

<h3>Common Inline Merry Uses</h3>

<p>There are many things you can do in SAM by using inline Merry,
but these are some of the most common:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$[Set($this, "my:property:name", 1);] &ndash; Sets the
  property my:property:name in object $this to 1.</li>

  <li>$[Set($this, "my:property:name", Get($this,
  "my:property:name) + 1); ] &ndash; Adds 1 to property
  my:property:name on object $this</li>
</ul>
<pre>
You look at &lt;describe what=$(this)&gt; and your surroundings change!
   $[      EmitIn(Get($actor, "base:environment"), Describe($actor) + "
looks at " + Describe($dbob) + " and disappears!\n", $actor);
         $actor."base:environment" =
${Examples:complete:desc:room-go-nowhere};
         $actor."base:proximity" =
NewNRef(${Examples:complete:desc:room-go-nowhere}, "floor");
         $actor."base:stancestring" = "lying";
         $actor."base:prepositionstring" = "on";
         EmitIn(Get($actor, "base:environment"), Describe($actor) + "
appears out of nowhere lying on the floor!\n", $actor);
   ]
</pre>

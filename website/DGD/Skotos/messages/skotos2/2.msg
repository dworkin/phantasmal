When the base and the three initial modules are done and far enough past 
alpha that bug reports won't irritate me. The base and HTTP are in 
alpha; Merry is nearly there, and I haven't begun writing code for SAM. 
I'd guess code could be released in a month, but probably not earlier. 
That one is tentatively called 1.9.8b.

1.9.9 has a whole lot more code in it and 2.0, which should feature most 
of the existing SkotOS 1.* code, is a truly massive undertaking. By then 
I hope to have a couple of other volunteers working on the project.

@@TITLE Introduction to SAM: Skotos Active Markup@@

<h2>The Problem of Dynamic Text</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>SkotOS is largely concerned with presenting text to users. In a
dynamic, interactive system such as ours, environments and
occurances are forever changing, yet they must be described in
consistent ways, even artistic ways, to the inhabitants of the
virtual world:</p>
<pre>
   You are kneeling next to Fred in a dingy hut.  Jane stands near the door.
A
   long, black sword lies at her feet. The rain pours down outside.
</pre>

<p>This is a description which is clearly associated with the hut
in which we are kneeling, yet refers to current occupants, items on
the floor, and the weather outside: the description mingles static
text with dynamic data. The system's ability to do this well is
absolutely vital to making the user's experience in the world a
good one.</p>

<h3>A Solution</h3>

<p>Since the program that serves the user with the description is
the same one in which the dynamic data resides, there is a simple
solution to the quandry above. Let the descriptive text contain
special codes that instruct the world server to calculate and embed
dynamic descriptions. This could be part of the description of a
statue you find in a room:</p>
<pre>
   "The statue appears to be $(this.expression) at you."
</pre>

<p>This statue is alive, it turns out, and can either frown at you
or smile, depending on whether or not you've kept up your
sacrifices to the local dark lord. Thus when a user looks at the
statue, the server knows to query the expression property of the
statue. The definition of this property in the statue includes some
logic that investigates the user staring at it, and sends back
either 'frowning' or 'smiling'.</p>

<p>This is the core of SAM: the developer writes static
descriptions that contain active markup. The markup is evaluated by
the server at each time the user actually observes the description.
The perceived description is populated with current data.</p>

<h3>SAM Everywhere</h3>

<p>Once we came up with this idea of marked-up text, a whole world
of possibilities opened up before us. We look further than
description; since web pages are essentially text, why not use this
same system to generate web pages on the fly, populated with
up-to-date world data:</p>
<pre>
   Welcome to Sir John's village status page!

   Johnsville currently has 612 inhabitants. The weather is cold
   and sunny. Thirty-one cows graze the fields. Alewife Christina
   made her latest batch of ale approximately nine hours ago.
</pre>

<p>The SAM in this case would underlie HTML rather than straight
text, but to the server there is no difference.</p>

<h3>More Power</h3>

<p>The more we play with SAM, the more its potential power became
apparant to us, and the more we added to it. Early on we decided to
add conditional functionality:</p>
<pre>
   This is a long black sword with intricate carvings.
   &lt;if val="$(greaterthan lhs='$looker.skill:weapon-lore' rhs='5')"&gt;
      &lt;true&gt;
         . You recognize the make as Alvatian.
      &lt;/true&gt;
      &lt;false&gt;
         It is nighttime.
      &lt;/false&gt;
   &lt;/if&gt;
</pre>

<p>where the user will only be told of the sword's make if he has
studied his weapon lore.</p>

<p>We also add iteration, e.g.</p>
<pre>
   Welcome to Sir John's cow status page! Here's who's grazing
   the fields today:
   &lt;for var="cow" val="$(Cows)"&gt;
      $(Cow.CapitalizedName) is grazing in $(Cow.Pasture) and is
      feeling $(Cow.Contendedness).
   &lt;/for&gt;
</pre>

<p>where $(Cows) is an array of, yes, cows, and the SAM within the
for loop is executed once for each element of this array. The
result is a list of cows, their whereabouts, and how happy they are
at the moment.</p>

<p>We've introduced new syntax here; readers may recognize it as
similar to HTML. It is in fact XML, a close relative, and it is the
syntactic model we have chosen to express SAM.</p>

<h3>Shortcuts for SAM</h3>

<p>As we used more and more SAM, the extra "text" in the shortcuts
required for XML often made reading descriptions more difficult. To
address this, we created SAM Shortcuts. These are alternative ways
to use SAM but with shorter tags, making it descriptions easier to
read.</p>

<p>For example, in the Black Sword example above, the following SAM
shortcut works exactly the same way:</p>
<pre>
   This is a long black sword with intricate carvings.
   {? greaterthen | $looker.skill:weapon-lore | 5 |
      . You recognize the make as Alvatian.|
      .}
</pre>

<p>Technically this is not XML markup, but internally SkotOS
converts this to XML.</p>

<h3>Existing Approaches</h3>

<p>(We need someone to write up how LPMuds and other MUDs have
tried to do this in the past)</p>

<h3>Problems Solved by Skotos SAM System</h3>

<p>(TBW)</p>

<h3>State of Development</h3>

<p>The SAM System is relatively mature and complete. Much of the
fundamental power of it was proven in Castle Marrach, and now is
being used more fully in various Skotos-Seven games, and is now
also used for dynamic web pages and for our web client.</p>

<h3>Open Issues in the SAM System</h3>

<p>There are very few major issues with SAM itself, due to its
maturity and several years of development. However, there are some
related systems that have weaknesses that affect SAM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right now brief/glance/look/examine descriptions (and their
  all/dark/dim/bright/superbright variants) are not actually
  socials, so they do not get as many arguments as do the social
  tags. Useful information that is lacking includes which verb was
  used, the distance the actor is from the detail being viewed,
  etc. As soon as these commands are converted to Merry, all of
  these useful arguments will be available to these descriptions as
  well.</li>

  <li>There are quite a few commands that are not converted to
  Merry yet, so can't be used with signal descriptions written in
  SAM.</li>

  <li>The combinables system may have impact on SAM tags, as not
  all 'objects' will be single objects anymore.</li>
</ul>

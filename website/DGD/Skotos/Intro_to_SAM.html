<h2>The Problem of Dynamic Text</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  SkotOS is largely concerned with presenting text to users. In a
  dynamic, interactive system such as ours, environments and
  occurances are forever changing, yet they must be described in
  consistent ways, even artistic ways, to the inhabitants of the
  virtual world:
</p>

<pre>
   You are kneeling next to Fred in a dingy hut.  Jane stands near the door.
A
   long, black sword lies at her feet. The rain pours down outside.
</pre>

<p>
  This is a description which is clearly associated with the hut in
  which we are kneeling, yet refers to current occupants, items on the
  floor, and the weather outside: the description mingles static text
  with dynamic data. The system's ability to do this well is
  absolutely vital to making the user's experience in the world a good
  one.
</p>

<h3>A Solution</h3>

<p>
  Since the program that serves the user with the description is the
  same one in which the dynamic data resides, there is a simple
  solution to the quandry above. Let the descriptive text contain
  special codes that instruct the world server to calculate and embed
  dynamic descriptions. This could be part of the description of a
  statue you find in a room:
</p>

<pre>
   "The statue appears to be $(this.expression) at you."
</pre>

<p>
  This statue is alive, it turns out, and can either frown at you or
  smile, depending on whether or not you've kept up your sacrifices to
  the local dark lord. Thus when a user looks at the statue, the
  server knows to query the expression property of the statue. The
  definition of this property in the statue includes some logic that
  investigates the user staring at it, and sends back either
  'frowning' or 'smiling'.
</p>

<p>
  This is the core of SAM: the developer writes static descriptions
  that contain active markup. The markup is evaluated by the server at
  each time the user actually observes the description. The perceived
  description is populated with current data.
</p>

<h3>SAM Everywhere</h3>

<p>
  Once we came up with this idea of marked-up text, a whole world of
  possibilities opened up before us. We look further than description;
  since web pages are essentially text, why not use this same system
  to generate web pages on the fly, populated with up-to-date world
  data:
</p>

<pre>
   Welcome to Sir John's village status page!

   Johnsville currently has 612 inhabitants. The weather is cold
   and sunny. Thirty-one cows graze the fields. Alewife Christina
   made her latest batch of ale approximately nine hours ago.
</pre>

<p>
  The SAM in this case would underlie HTML rather than straight text,
  but to the server there is no difference.
</p>

<h3>More Power</h3>

<p>
  The more we play with SAM, the more its potential power became
  apparant to us, and the more we added to it. Early on we decided to
  add conditional functionality:
</p>

<pre>
   This is a long black sword with intricate carvings.
   <if val="$(greaterthan lhs='$looker.skill:weapon-lore' rhs='5')">
      <true>
         . You recognize the make as Alvatian.
      </true>
      <false>
         It is nighttime.
      </false>
   </if>
</pre>

<p>
  where the user will only be told of the sword's make if he has studied his
  weapon lore.
</p>

<p>We also add iteration, e.g.</p>

<pre>
   Welcome to Sir John's cow status page! Here's who's grazing
   the fields today:
   <for var="cow" val="$(Cows)">
      $(Cow.CapitalizedName) is grazing in $(Cow.Pasture) and is
      feeling $(Cow.Contendedness).
   </for>
</pre>

<p>
  where $(Cows) is an array of, yes, cows, and the SAM within the for
  loop is executed once for each element of this array. The result is
  a list of cows, their whereabouts, and how happy they are at the
  moment.
</p>

<p>
  We've introduced new syntax here; readers may recognize it as
  similar to HTML. It is in fact XML, a close relative, and it is the
  syntactic model we have chosen to express SAM.
</p>

<h3>Shortcuts for SAM</h3>

<p>
  As we used more and more SAM, the extra "text" in the shortcuts
  required for XML often made reading descriptions more difficult. To
  address this, we created SAM Shortcuts. These are alternative ways
  to use SAM but with shorter tags, making it descriptions easier to
  read.
</p>

<p>
  For example, in the Black Sword example above, the following SAM
  shortcut works exactly the same way:
</p>

<pre>
   This is a long black sword with intricate carvings.
   {? greaterthen | $looker.skill:weapon-lore | 5 |
      . You recognize the make as Alvatian.|
      .}
</pre>

<p>
  Technically this is not XML markup, but internally SkotOS converts
  this to XML.
</p>

<h3>Existing Approaches</h3>

<p>
  (We need someone to write up how LPMuds and other MUDs have tried to
  do this in the past)
</p>

<h3>Problems Solved by Skotos SAM System</h3>

<p>
  (TBW)
</p>

<h3>State of Development</h3>

<p>
  The SAM System is relatively mature and complete. Much of the
  fundamental power of it was proven in Castle Marrach, and now is
  being used more fully in various Skotos-Seven games, and is now also
  used for dynamic web pages and for our web client.
</p>

<h3>Open Issues in the SAM System</h3>

<p>
  There are very few major issues with SAM itself, due to its maturity
  and several years of development. However, there are some related
  systems that have weaknesses that affect SAM:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Right now brief/glance/look/examine descriptions (and their
    all/dark/dim/bright/superbright variants) are not actually
    socials, so they do not get as many arguments as do the social
    tags. Useful information that is lacking includes which verb was
    used, the distance the actor is from the detail being viewed,
    etc. As soon as these commands are converted to Merry, all of
    these useful arguments will be available to these descriptions as
    well.
  </li>

  <li>
    There are quite a few commands that are not converted to Merry
    yet, so can't be used with signal descriptions written in SAM.
  </li>

  <li>
    The combinables system may have impact on SAM tags, as not all
    'objects' will be single objects anymore.
  </li>

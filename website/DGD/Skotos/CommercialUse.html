  <h2> Licensing DGD Commercially </h2>

  <p>
    Licensing DGD from Dworkin, at this point, costs about $100,000.00
    US per year.  No, that's not a misprint.  Yes, it's well out of
    hobbyist range.  You can get a cheaper price if you're a nonprofit
    organization, or under some similar conditions, but it's still not
    particularly cheap.  Before you send horrendous angry mail to
    Dworkin about how greedy he is, <i>please</i> read further.  He
    originally licensed at a much lower cost, and it didn't work <i>at
    all</i>.  He has already tried the approach you're going to
    suggest.  No, I'm not thrilled with the current situation either.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can potentially get a much lower price through Skotos,
    depending on whether you compete with them, whether you're willing
    to contribute code back to them, and how they choose to work with
    you.  The basic license agreement that they have involves
    (involved?) paying $75,000, or $25,000 per year &mdash; still well
    below the cost to directly license DGD through Felix.  Their
    license-discounting scheme is at best semi-public, but some
    licensing agreements that they've had in the past are known.
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case, Skotos has been willing to deal in the past, so if
    you think you're not far off being able to pay the license fee, or
    mostly noncompeting, or otherwise an &quot;almost&quot; case,
    talking to Christopher Allen could be a wise move.
  </p>

  <h3> Other Licensing Conditions </h3>

  <p>
    Skotos may consider licensing to you cheaper if you don't compete
    with their business.  Their business is games, and more
    specifically MUDs, so your MUD probably <i>does</i> compete with
    their business.  They're unlikely to give you a seriously cheap
    DGD license for a commercial MUD.  However, they might choose to
    work with you directly, which is an entirely different agreement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Skotos has, in the past, been willing to give very cheap use of
    DGD to those who work with their libraries and contribute code
    back.  They also have an in-house plan for developing games which
    will run on Skotos servers, using DGD commercially.  The idea is
    that the DGD license is supplied free, because Skotos is the one
    using it.  The developer (you) will be paid a royalty based on the
    number of subscribers your game draws to Skotos' site, as measured
    by the amount of time and the number of people that your game has
    at any given time.  If your game is sufficiently popular, you get
    royalties.  Those are split between the implementor(s) and head
    builder(s) in a prearranged way.  If you're using licensed
    intellectual property like Chaosium's Lovecraft Country in your
    game, the royalties are proportionally lower.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your chances of becoming rich off their royalty payments is very,
    very low.  However, it's a way to develop a commercial MUD,
    running on commercial servers, for nothing out-of-pocket to you.
    They are offering a free-but-unlikely chance to get rich at no
    charge, so you can think of it as a free lottery ticket they've
    just given you.  Unfortunately, unlike a lottery ticket, you'll
    need to write a MUD and run it for awhile before they see if your
    numbers match :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that any changes you make to the underlying Skotos lib, or
    that builds in a non-game-specific way on top of it, will need to
    be submitted back to Skotos for possible inclusion in the base
    library.  You may believe that that's unfair, and that if they're
    not going to give you any guaranteed payments, they should get
    nothing from you except whatever business you drum up.  The Skotos
    response is basically that 1) licensing DGD costs them a lot of
    money, 2) running the servers costs them a lot of money, and 3)
    your game doesn't make them a lot of money.  If it did, you'd be
    getting lots of royalties.
  </p>

  <h3> Technical Capabilities </h3>

  <p>
    The commercial version of DGD has a couple of nonstandard
    capabilities, but they're basically outmatched by the network
    patch, so it's nothing extraordinary.  In general, free DGD has
    the same feature set as commercial DGD.

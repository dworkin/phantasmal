  <h2> So What's This Skotos Thing? </h2>

  <p>
    Periodically, you'll see Skotos mentioned with regard to DGD.  You
    may find the sheer frequency of reference confusing, especially
    since they're not actually the vendors of DGD itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> is a company that makes
    commercial games, including commercial MUDs.  They do
    pay-for-play, with a single monthly fee for access to their entire
    set of offerings.  They also sublicense DGD for commercial use
    &mdash; if you want to make money off a DGD-based MUD, Skotos are
    the folks to talk to.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until SkotOS 2.0 (their open-source DGD-based offering) comes out,
    there's little or no code from Skotos that is open-source.  Since
    any DGD library is of the keenest interest to DGD programmers at
    this point.  It's not like we've got many libs to look at.  That
    makes us (well, me and a few others, certainly) quite keen to find
    out more about how Skotos' library works.
  </p>

  <p>
    Folks with a more commercial bent are also quite curious how their
    licensing scheme works.  You can find out a bit about becoming a
    developer for them on their web site.  You develop a game for use
    on their servers, and when enough people are playing it, you get
    paid a small royalty.  That royalty is split among the appropriate
    game creators in a prearranged way.

Before Skotos purchased a license from iChat/Acuity for DGD, we evaluated a
number of drivers and mudlibs, including Melville. We really liked DGD, but
no existing mud libs really fit the bill to take advantage of the power of
DGD. Instead, we decided to write our own. The lead designer is Par Winzell,
who worked extensively with Felix when DGD was originally licensed to
Acuity.

We have been developing one from scratch since February, and we hope to have
a public version of our Basic Lib available in October. It will be available
with a free non-commercial license similar to the current DGD license, or as
a license from us (along with DGD itself) for commercial purposes, or also
license the DGD driver alone. We also will be hosting commercial games under
an 'associate' program where we do the billing and our associates create the
games.

Among other features, the mud driver has a web interface for administration
and creation, and all objects are described in XML forms. The basic lib will
include everything you need for the base for a next-generation mud,
including true persistence, and a more extensive social expression mechanism
than I think ever has been written before (it will make the MUSH'ers
jealous). What it will not have is a game system -- you have to write your
own combat.

We will be notifying this list as we make more progress, or you can write to
us at <skotos@skotos.net>.

---

>From an email sent to MudDev list:

Just FYI, as it is a bit premature for us to say a whole lot more, but given
the context of the current conversation we thought it was appropriate to
preannounce.

We thought you should know that we have a started commercial company called
Skotos Tech that is building a commercial text-based mud system that will
have some graphic-enhancements. We have been in business since February,
have already acquired commercial rights to the proven DGD driver from the
former iChat, we have hired Mud-Dev member Par Winzell <zell@skotos.net>,
and we are in the process of building a new mud-lib on top of DGD that among
other things will make game development alot easier.

We believe that there are a number of things that a graphic mud can't do, in
particular, emotional context (try to get your UO character to bow
sarcastically,) game worlds of enormous size and vitality, game worlds where
all the players can play in the same "game" rather then autotomous instances
of the game, and where the game size and number of players is actually
relevant to the game play rather then being a nasty side affect. We plan to
focus on those advantages as that is one place that graphic muds, due to the
amount of time it takes to create unique graphics, can not compete.

We plan on recruiting a number of programmers and game designers in the fall
to work on three "flagship" muds, and we will also make our tools available
to independent "associates" that want to use our system to create their own
games under our quality-control standards and receive royalties. If things
progress as we hope, we'll have betas for our flagship muds next spring and
will release product to the public in September 2000. We also hope to have a
new basic mud-lib for DGD based on our work that we will make available for
non-commercial Muds that don't want to make commercial product but want to
play with our tools.

This list is probably not the right place to talk about business models, but
I am open to talking with others about our business model for doing commerci
al muds. We've done alot of research in this area but are quite open to
learning from others and sharing what we've learned so far.

The following is oriented toward explaining Skotos Tech to those that don't
know what MUDs are, but you might find it useful to understand what we are
up to.

About Skotos Tech
-----------------
Skotos Tech is an exciting new game company determined to bring an entirely
fresh paradigm to the world of online gaming. Quality stories will be the
key to the Skotos experience, not gory special effects. Through high-quality
graphically-enhanced text-based games, Skotos plans to create a virtual
community of gamers and storytellers from all over the world. Besides
providing its own games, Skotos will also offer tools and services to world
designers, authors, and programmers, so that they easily can create their
own games and offer them to the Skotos online community.

The central goal of Skotos is to produce a core set of games, forming a
storytelling community. These games will be the natural evolution of MUDs
and other text-based games, but they will be richer, with more consistency
and integrity than anything currently available, and will feature a level of
advancement that is only possible with the full resources of a professional
company. Graphical clients will round out these games, providing a more
immersive experience without overdominating the text. These core games will
run the spectrum of genres, helping Skotos to create a wide and varied
community. From romance to science fiction, Skotos Tech will cater to a
variety of interests.

The world of Skotos Tech will be much larger than just a small collection of
core entertainments. Skotos will also feature games playing out specific
story lines, with definite beginnings, middles, and endings. Events will
intrude as players interact with each other to accomplish their own goals.
These fixed-duration games will combine the best features of Live Action
Role-Playing Games (LARPs) and text adventures in a way previously unseen in
the online world.

And that's just the start of Skotos' online gaming experience. Skotos Tech
will also offer tools for creating online games and will act as a service
provider to developers. These games, produced by external developers, will
be available through the Skotos servers. The best storytellers, game
authors, and programmers will be invited to become associates at Skotos
Tech, offering their games in exchange for a percentage of revenues.
Externally developed games will be rigorously tested to ensure that they
meet Skotos' standards of quality before they become part of the Skotos
family.

But, Skotos is doing more than just creating a nexus of online games. Skotos
Tech is creating a true community. Skotos users will be able to interact
with each other not just in the games, but also in other online forums. They
will be able to register e-mail addresses and web pages, both for themselves
and their characters in the various on-line games. Skotos Tech gamers will
be able to share the accomplishments of their characters, as well as their
own interests, drawing together the players of all the Skotos Tech games
into one community of storytellers and gamers.

Skotos Tech is currently in its initial stages of development. Its initial
funding is through Alacrity Ventures, and is being incubated at Alacrity's
management center. The initial release of Skotos Tech is planned for
September, 2000. Watch www.skotos.net for more information. If you are
interested in joining our team or becoming an associate, mail
jobs@skotos.net.

Subject: Re: [DGD]Melville Mudlib

In response to Dworkin's recent stirring posting about the interesting
times ahead and a new generation of mudlibs, here's an outline of some
of the constituent parts of the lib we're writing at Skotos, including
discussion and motivation.

By far the most influential factor on design has been persistence; the
idea of a state space that is cold-booted only once and then stays up,
potentially forever. Core support for this has been in DGD for a long
time; much of Dworkin's kernel library is designed with these demands
in mind, and people have been -talking- about peristent Muds for a long
time. So why aren't there any yet?

Well, it's damn hard. One of the basic problems, a recent topic on this
list, is program upgrading which requires LPC support in the form of a
object-database. More generally, the necessity of basic consistency is
upped brutally. If after a year of precious uptime you find some vital
datastructure to be corrupted, you're going to be very sad. When this
happens to the mudlib you wrote, you'll be glad you based it around the
kernel lib -- which still runs, and lets you do an emergency login and
poke at the guts of your broken world.

So we use the kernel library, unmodified. Easy decision to make.

Incidentally, the -game- effects of persistency are of course enormous.
That's another discussion entirely.

The ~System level is small. It has three major components -- the object
database; a second-level auto object which adds some protection against
destructing clonable objects that have clones; and some API translation
to the rest of the lib of kernel services which only ~System is allowed
to directly access.

The guts are in ~SkotOS. This means they get the benefit of the ~System
level restrictions and clone book-keeping. Here we have,

 * HTTP service. Text is great, but a browser interface can be used to
great advantage, especially for administration and development. This is
especially true in a persistent game, where manipulating state in one
way or another is much more important than in a rebooting Mud, where it
is the LPC (and save_object) files that really determine what the world
is. We're flirting with HTTP 1.1 compliance.

 * Standardized functionality for the export and import of object state
through XML. To use this system, the object describes its function-call
interface for query() and set() style operations. With this description
we are able not only to fetch the object state and transcribe it to XML
but also to generate for it a true DTD (Document Type Definition). With
the help of this DTD, which describes precisely the possible structures
of the state, external XML authoring software will be able to construct
word-processor quality GUI's for any object that uses the system.

 * An XML parser (and generator) which uses parse_string(). XML is just
a data storage format, so just parsing it does little. The data may be
object state as per above, destined to be squeezed back into an object
somewhere. In addition to this static structure, however, we use XML to
do an active mark-up of text fields. In SGML/XML terms this is "PCDATA".
   - In-game descriptions may be marked up to vary depending on server
state; for example, a room description may vary by light level relative
to the looker's night-vision stat, or variables associated with players
or rooms or other objects may be embedded in the text.
   - We also generate HTML from the XML, and thus automatically have a
powerful system for server-side generation of dynamic HTML. We'll ship
the lib with a set of such XML-HTML pages.

 * A decent command parser which should understand a sensible subset of
English. We have chosen to completely forbid guess-the-verb puzzles, by
centralizing the parser entirely. If a verb does something anywhere, it
does something everywhere. Successful commands are turned into actions
or sequences of actions taken by objects in the virtual world. We tried
for as much separation between client-interface and world as possible.
These sequences of actions could equally well be generated by clicking
on things in some isometric graphical client. While we try to keep that
door open, we're concentrating on text as the primary interface; though
we expect ambitious developers to allow for e.g. stat-showing graphical
client-side panes, scrolling (and clickable) maps, and more.

 * A pretty intricate system for expressive/emotive stuff; while there
is no emote-command, the social verbs are plentiful and come with lots
of adverbs. That's nothing new; the interesting stuff are stances and
poses, which are tied into the world simulation to a higher degree than
I have seen elsewhere. I am able to e.g. kneel before an altar in quiet
repose, or lie on a table, or stand next to Dworkin in a room with more
effect than a transient statement of fact -- these ways in which things
can relate to each other is used in describing the environment. Certain
socials break certain stances and poses.

 * There's the idea of a prox -- something one can be in the proximity
of. Dropped gear will be lying 'near Zell' instead of in the usual big
collective heap. If I walk away from my battle-axe, it simply lies on
the floor. One of the things we hope to do is to kill off this ancient
truth that LPMuds aren't very good for social Mudders.


Phew. Then, finally, there is the virtual world itself. We separate the
world objects from things like command parsing and text generation much
more than does e.g. 2.4.5; this helps the world state to be independent
of client interface, as discussed above. We just took a step further in
this direction and utterly slew the time-honoured sub-classing approach
to physical objects. There is now only the ur-thing, and it can be room
or sword or bag of gold -- or all three -- depending only on its state.
Thus everything is really a clone of /base/obj/thing, everything can be
eaten (possibly with great discomfort) or used as a weapon (possibly a
very bad weapon). Of couse, that effect is equally possible to achieve
with traditional sub-classing. The difference is again the trend toward
the data-driven, which seems to happen naturally around persistence.


It should not be difficult to tell that the early part of this document
details things that are pretty much settled, while the mutations of the
/base directory are recent and somewhat shocking.

So. When will all this be available to play with? I'm unsure. October?

I can't speak to the functional differences of the 2 versions (I heard that
there was extended network functionality in the commercial one, but don't
quote me), but there's more to the process of obtaining a commercial license
than meets the eye.

[Note to Chris -- you're a respected innovator and your reputation precedes
you, but I'm going to be quite frank in my opinion of _my_ understanding of
the license terms.  If I'm wrong on any of the points, do clarify as these
points were the major reasons why I did not further pursue a commercial
license.]

It costs money.  That's a given and is not all that surprising.  If you're a
college student, though, I wouldn't dwell on the possibility for too long.
;)  In addition, though, here is my understanding of the rights and
obligations associated with said license (as per my conversation with
Chris):

1) You are able to use DGD proper for commercial purposes; profit can be
gained from its usage.

2) You are given a copy of the lib that Skotos is working on and are
required to use that lib as the foundation for the projects that will run on
your commercial license of DGD.

3) If you make any modifications to said lib, you are further required to
submit those changes to Skotos so that they can be evaluated for inclusion
in their copy of the same lib.  This is where I begged for some
clarification.  It was implied that implementation-specific changes would
not need to be submitted, but I was not given a clear definition of what
"implementation-specific" meant.  The point was finally justified by him
suggesting to me that everyone should be working with, and benefiting from,
the same advances.

4) I inquired to the possibilities of obtaining a license where #2 and #3
would not exist.  This had evidentally not been asked before b/c he replied
with, "Sure.  I'm sure we can work something out." :)  "Working something
out" entails paying upward of $75K.  Not good.

#1 is expected.  #2 would be acceptable given that #3 didn't exist.  I just
don't see how they can expect others to pay for a license, be required to
use a code base, submit changes made to said codebase (which, by the way,
they would be able to further profit from), and then feel that they have
something special; unique; and worth inidividual development.  To me, that's
like saying, "Here's your house.  You paid good money for it.  Any
additions/improvements that you make to the house, though, must also be
provided to everyone else in your neighborhood."  Nuh uh.  I'll go rent an
apartment and loose all potential equity I might gain from owning a house.
;)

Anyway, like I said, if I'm wrong on the above (or if things have changed),
please correct me.

The versions are almost identical. There are minor differences, mainly some
features added by iChat and still supported by Felix, and some very minor
changes by us. We track all the updates by Felix pretty much the day they come
out.

We also include some libraries above the kernel library -- we have our own
network package, for instance.

The line of demarcation is becoming more specific as we do some architectural

It is the game world and game specific mechanics (such as the specifics of

Essentially correct, to be more precise to the nuances here is the story.

We paid a lot of money for our license to DGD, and since have have several man
years of efforts based on it. We are not really planning to be in the business
of selling drivers or mud libs, and in fact are concerned about it diluting our
business in the future. However, we don't want to make obtaining DGD as hard as
it was for us. Thus we'll make a game license available to others for $75K, or
$25K a year. We are also open to a royalty scheme, but we will require an
advance and minimum quarterly royalties.

We are willing to lower these prices, however, in return we expect to get some
contributions from you which we can incorporate into the product. Thus the
requirement to use our library and submit enhancements back to us.

We also will be making available to select developers, starting in the late
summer, the ability to create games using SkotOS on our service, in which we
will pay royalties to the developers when the product is released to our
customers. See www.skotos.net for more information on what we will be offering.

As per a recent announcement by yourself, I checked out the aforementioned
website.  Suffice it to say that I lost many a productive hour that
afternoon reading, looking at, and otherwise enjoying what you had put
together.  Outstanding web site and an equally impressive approach to
interactive game building.

Your explanation holds merit, but only in the context of a game-like
implementation.  About a year ago, I used DGD to design an interactive
web-driven workspace and CVS-like repository for our development department.
I had to abandon its development due to the small size of the team and the
increased "real" projects which were put upon us, but such an idea could
prove extremely useful.  Alas, though, I can not make profit on it (without
the discussed terms) lest I dilute the gaming industry?

DGD is a language... a tool... much like Python, PHP, Perl, and Java are all
tools.  You basically have a monopoly over all things DGD, so I think you're
quite safe from being ousted by something developed with DGD.  Why not,
though, apply your restrictions and cost requirements on those that seek to
directly compete within your sector and/or use your metalibs?

You probably won't agree with me on this, but the cost/licensing
requirements of DGD (if applied in a universal manner) are going to prohibit
it from really being a part of something special outside of SkotOS.  It's a
shame to see something so innovative (esp. with the up-in-coming SMP
support) get passed over because it costs so much (much less costs anything
at all as compared to its scripting/interpreter counterparts).  I have a
hard time believing that Dworkin is putting so much work (and solid theory)
behind this product just so people can run a better, free MUD.  He did,
after all, rename it from Dworkin's _Game_ Driver to Dworkin's _Generic_
Driver.

Anyway, this isn't meant to cause a rebellion or anything.  Just some things
to mull over.  I, for one, look forward to SkotOS if for no other reason
than to really experience the capabilities of DGD.  I've all but had to give
up DGD/LPC-related development due to employment requirements, but it
doesn't mean I can't appreciate one fine piece of work. ;)

You do have a point. I deliberately tried to avoid game specific language in the
DGD specification for just such reasons.  For instance, our current
implementation above DGD includes a complete web server, with fairly
sophisticated capabilities and XML support, that could be used for a myriad of
purposes other then games.

I did not realize what specific use you had in mind -- we have had people
approach us for "non-game industry" games, such as educational games, but no one
has specifically approached us for using it for a different kind of product. We
still have to charge for it, but we might consider another model if the
restrictions were sufficient.

You will be surprised to learn that my motivation for adding MP support
to DGD is mostly commercial.  It is not anything that I am going to make
money with directly, but then again, the real money will be in mudlibs.
I hope that MP support for DGD is going to make the goal of running an
EverQuest-sized mud on a single machine attainable.  Keeping this in
mind, Skotos' $75K fee begins to look entirely reasonable.

As a general purpose programmable server, can DGD compete with Python,
or even with Pike?  Obviously not: Python and Pike are free.  Commercial
use of DGD has always required license payments, even though they used
to be far more modest.  It turned out that that modest licensing fees
did not work: nobody ever obtained such a license.  In order to let
DGD survive as a commercial product, I had to target it at a different
audience.

(There are further reasons for DGD not being able to compete with open
source scripting languages.  LPC, though superb for a persistent mud,
is not as good as a general purpose language.)

I don't regret going Massively Commercial with DGD, since this allowed
me to continue improving it as an independent developer.  It is a pity
that the server is now out of reach for the small-scale commercial
developer -- but that's how it is.

Regards,
Dworkin

Actually, I'm not surprised at all. :)  Like I said above, I'd have an
awfully hard time believing that you were doing so if your sights weren't
set on something larger than the stereotypical MUD.  I completely agree,
though, that $75K is nothing compared to the other costs that'll be incurred
in doing something of EverQuest-like scope.  The context in which I've been
presenting a point of view, though, has been with those projects that are
significantly less complex than EverQuest yet have commercial merit.

I understand.  I, for one, am not calling your decision into question, but
rather the decisions and circumstances that now surround DGD-specific
commercial opportunity for those other than SkotOS.  I hear, understand, and
otherwise acknowledge the decisions that've been made.  I just wanted to
make sure that people weren't of the opinion that all it took was a $200
check and, bam!, they're free to realize the <insert nation here> Dream
without further due or obligation.  As we've discussed, there's more to it.
;)

If this whole licensing thing were getting in my way of realizing some
killer application (which, in my opinion, web-based applictions have more of
a commercial and revenue-generating future than do EverQuest-like games), I
would probably pursue the points futher.  But because there are other
suitable alternatives out there for non-game server scenarios, I merely
wanted this to be a matter of clarifying what is, not what should be.

Having now said all of this, we might want to add the particulars of the
commercial license to the FAQ.  Or, at the very least, have Mr. Allen
enumerate the discussed points on a linkable web page.

You exaggerate, and the parts about the 'no credit' part and 'minimal effort on
their part' are flatly false.

The rights to DGD were very expensive for us to purchase, we have put man years
into a modern web-centric library on top of it, plan to put in many more man
years, and are building what we hope will be a multi-million dollar in revenue
online game service. However, I don't want DGD to be as difficult to purchase as
it was for us, so it is available, just not cheaply.

What is true -- if don't want to pay the full price for DGD, one way to get the
full price reduced is to agree to contribute back non-game specific
functionality back to Skotos so that we may incorporate it into future versions
of the product available to all licensees. Combat systems are on the edge
between 'game specific' and 'non-game specific' and I'd hope that anyone that
we'd partner with would deal with these edge issues in good faith.

You also do not have to 'buy' DGD or our library to build games -- if you create
a game on our service, we pay you up to a 20% royalty, and we do all the hard
work for that. Customer support, marketing, a reliable data center, billing,
etc. are not inexpensive. We have also licensed rights to be allow our games to
be able to use backgrounds from Lovecraft Country and Paranoia, and hope to
announce more licenses soon.

We hope to offer what we call 'StoryBuilder' functionality to all members of our
service next year, but meanwhile, we are accepting proposals from folks that
wish to get an early start on our service and create games now. We call this
group the Skotos Seven, and will be paying an advance on royalties for the work.
Information on the Skotos Seven is at our website at
http://www.skotos.net/storybuilders/.

Subject: [DGD] Commercial use
Message-ID: <200109262208.AAA00645@dworkin.nl>

Starting today, DGD is available for commercial use again, directly from
BeeHive Internet Technologies.  Quintus, which previously held an
exclusive license, is bankrupt and their license is terminated.

Licensing inquiries can be directed at <dgd-licensing@dworkin.nl>.  You
should realize that the situation at present is in a state of flux, and
we will probably create a new Copyright file, which at present is
identical to the old one, but with all reference to ichat/Acuity/Quintus
removed.

My plans:

 - DGD remains free for non-commercial use.
 - Non-profit organisations will be able to license DGD for a modest fee.
 - Other commercial use will be much more expensive, similar to what
   Skotos has been charging for a sublicense.

However, we can also break this up smaller, for instance, the detail

Or the description examine can be XML'ized:

<object id="OBJ(Ur:tool:smith:anvil)">
  <context>
    <iterator var="id" val="surface" type="lpc_str"/>
    <iterator var="type" val="examine" type="xml_pcdata"/>

  <Base:Description type="examine">
     The waist-high upper surface of the anvil is smooth and dark. There
are two holes in it: a square hardy hole, and a round pritchel hole.
  </Base:Description>
</object>

Theoretically (though never done in practice) we could convert a whole
game into a single XML file.

If you are considering a game for us, either using your own library (as
WAP does with Grendel's Revenge and TEC) or Skotos' own library (which
is used by Castle Marrach), then you'll have access to our clients
(ActiveX, Java, and Mozilla Javascript) which all use HTML font tags for
color inside the text window.

You can specify any color you want using hex codes, but the following
are the default named ones:

{ "black",    0x000000 },
{ "white",    0xffffff },
{ "green",    0x00ff00 },
{ "maroon",   0x800000 },
{ "olive",    0x008000 },
{ "navy",     0x000080 },
{ "purple",   0x800080 },
{ "gray",     0x808080 },
{ "red",      0xff0000 },
{ "yellow",   0xffff00 },
{ "blue",     0x0000ff },
{ "teal",     0x008080 },
{ "lime",     0x808000 },
{ "aqua",     0x00ffff },
{ "fuchsia",  0xff00ff },
{ "silver",   0xc0c0c0 },

In addition, the Alice ActiveX client supports some (but not all) of the
Pueblo commands:

You can also send special SKOOT commands that will command the clients
to execute Javascript in the window that the client resides in.

The Marrach game uses colors (see the command PROFILE to set default
colours) and some the Pueblo specific tags (see the command EXITS).
Grendel's Revenge makes most use of the SKOOT commands. To see these
features you will need to be using our ActiveX client on Internet
Explorer.

You don't really need to know about the clients, just how to interface
with them. For instance, in our Marrach client, when an object is
dropped in a room, it also shows up in a popup menu to the right of the
of the text area. The way this works is that whenever an object arrives
in a room, a SKOOT event is sent, basically something like "SKOOT 15 a
rock". The web page recieves the SKOOT 15 messages, and sends it to
function 15, which in our case is the javascript:

function addObject(str) {
  var ix, pos, name;

  pos = str.indexOf(' ');
  if (pos >= 0) {
    ix = str.substring(0, pos);
    name = str.substring(pos+1);
    if (this["objectSet"] == null) {
        this["objectSet"] = new Object();
    }
    this["objectSet"][ix] = name;
    updateAll();
//    alert('object ' + name + ' added');
  }
}

The fact that we use 15 for addObject is not relevant -- WAP uses a
completely different set of SKOOT # messages that call Javascripts that
they wrote for their client. Whatever you can do in Javascript
dynamically (i.e. without refreshing the page) can be done using this
technique.

There is quite a bit of documentation that you get when you are involved
with developing for us, however, I'd say though we have alot, is never
enough ;-)

It is even possible to have the client be a 1x1 pixel client, and just
use it to control the dynamic web page.

All of the Skotos games use XML for exchange, i.e. internally objects
are stored as DGD persistent objects, but all can be exported and
imported as XML. We make no attempt to try to be totally faithful to the
various XML issues like DTD vs. Schemes, etc. We also have some XML
'shortcuts', dynamic object handles, and an XML control language called
SAM, that allow us to do interesting things with dynamic content that
might break a purist XML parser.

However, that we do as much as we do with XML and have multiple games
proves at least it can be done.

Enclosed is a simple example rose in our example directory, that shows
our XML for a simple object.

We'd be glad to talk with you further if you are serious. A license from
Skotos would be more restrictive then probably what Felix could offer
you (for instance, we can't offer you the multi-processor version) but
we also would be willing to working something out with you given the
right contractual conditions.

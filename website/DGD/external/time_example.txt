Example code:

void display(string message) {
    /* echo the message to a user, for instance */
    /* ... */
}

void display_time() {
    /*
     * timestamps for present and future use ;D
     *
     * a timestamp is a count of seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01,
     * 00:00:00, a.k.a. the Epoch
     */
    int present, future;

    present = time(); /* get the current time */
    future = present + (6 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60); /* add six weeks */
    display("The present: " + ctime(present));
    display("The future: " + ctime(future));

    display("I will notify you when the present becomes the future.");
    call_out("display_future", future - present);
}

void display_future() {
    display("The future is here.");
}

So, time() fetches you a timestamp for the present, while ctime()
formats a timestamp into a description.

dgd/doc/kfun/time
dgd/doc/kfun/ctime

If you need higher resolution than seconds, there is also
millitime().

dgd/doc/kfun/millitime

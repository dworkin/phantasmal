There's been a bit of talk about upgrading objects, and there's always
been people wanting code for it.  So...  This is how I'm doing upgrading
of objects.  Like Dworkin's kernel lib, I distinguish between classes
and objects.  Actually, I make a three-way distinction:

  1) libs: Anything with /lib/ in its path can be inherited.  It cannot
     be cloned.  No other objects can be inherited.  create() is not
     called, and the blueprint should not be used.
  2) clones: Anything with /obj/ in its path can be cloned.  No other
     objects can be cloned.  create() is called on the clones, but not
     the blueprint.  The blueprint should not be used.
  3) singles: All other objects have create() called on the blueprint.

2 and 3 together are called 'objects'.

If you're foolish enough to have *both* /lib/ and /obj/ in your path,
you're treated as a lib.

There is also mention of 'physical' objects.  These are clones that have
some 'real' existence in the MUD universe (including players).  Any
clone that wants a real existence inherits /kernel/lib/physical, which
defines (among many other things) the function is_physical() to simply
return 1.

The code below is NOT the best way of doing things.  In particular, I'm
not at all happy with the way that I'm including the auto object in the
inheritence table.  There's a bug in there somewhere too - it fails in
interesting ways if there was a compilation error.  

Hopefully having some code will provoke a little discussion, and maybe
even a little code...

/*  The auto object */

int is_clone() {
  return (sscanf(object_name(this_object()), "%*s#"));
}

void _create() {
  /* create() gets called for clones of objects in a .../obj/... directory, and
     for blueprints of objects that are not in a .../obj/... or .../lib/...
     directory, but not for anything else.  In particular, inherited objects
     and the blueprints of clones don't get create() called. */
  string name;

  name=object_name(this_object());
  /* It can only be a clone if it was in a .../obj/... directory, so no need
     to explicitly check for that */
  if (sscanf(name, "%*s#")) {
    this_object()->create();
  } else {
    if (!sscanf(name, "%*s/lib/") && !sscanf(name, "%*s/obj/")) {
      this_object()->create();
    }
  }

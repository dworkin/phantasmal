Yep - here it is...

Drop this into one of your existing kfun files, recompile dgd, reboot, and
you should have the sendmail() function...

I'm sure the system call can be cleaned up a bit, but it does the job I
want it to, so why change? ;)

Because:

- You don't do any sanity-checking of the email-addresses yourself.
- You don't do any checking of what results sendmail might give you.
- What if this is called with 'foo | rm -rf /' as 5th parameter?
- The 'tmail' file, in what directory does it end up, the top of the
  (mud)lib?
- You don't unlink the 'tmail' file, so someone with read-access there
  can read other people's outgoing email.

Just some pointers. :)

Not within that function I don't - I leave that up to the LPC wrapper
function that accepts all the details of the email...

No - sendmail emails back error messages...

> - What if this is called with 'foo | rm -rf /' as 5th parameter?

then you email someone the message "foo | rm -rf".

at the moment, yes.  But then, I personally couldn't give a monkey's about
where it is.  I suppose I should move it to ${MUDLIB}/tmp...

Only the one last email, and as I am the only one with read access on my
system then it really doesn't bother me.

Uhm.  Ok, my mistake, let me rephrase:

What if f->sp[4].u.string->text contains the text "foo | rm -rf /" as
contents?  Do you check for that?

|        sprintf(command,"sendmail -bs -F%s <tmail >tmail.out",
|                f->sp[4].u.string->text);
|        system(command);

You'd end up with:

  "sendmail -bs -Ffoo | rm -rf / <tmail >tmail.out"

How do you think system() is going to interpret that?

It's not that I think you don't care, but keep in mind that while you
are using this on a game where you are apparently the only one in
charge, if you're offering the code to others who are not, they might
not be aware of these flaws and find their games/computers hacked or
supposedly private email monitored by third parties who should not be
able to.

Please be careful.

Erwin.

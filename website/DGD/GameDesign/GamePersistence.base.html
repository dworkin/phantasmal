  <titledef text="Persistent Game Design" />

  <h2> Persistence, As Applied to Game Design </h2>

  <p> <i>
      Most of the in-game aspects of this problem have been discussed
      to death on MUD-Dev long ago.  If you're really curious, make
      sure to go read it.  This is a good quick summary, but there's
      more out there.  Always.
  </i> </p>

  <p>
    The phrase 'persistent world' means a world that exists
    more-or-less 24&frasl;7, whether you're there or not.  The
    implication is that some of the changes that you make to the world
    may persist.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a persistent world, it can be useful to have a <a
    href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistent server</a>,
    though that's not mandatory.  You can have a non-persistent world
    on a persistent server (EverQuest is almost this), or a persistent
    world on a non-persistent server (certain MUDs are exactly this).
    You may find it's <i>easier</i> to use a persistent server if
    you're going to host a persistent game, though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Current 'persistent worlds' aren't especially persistent.
    Respawning tends to occur so rapidly that if you leave for an
    hour, there's hardly any way to tell you were ever there except by
    looking at your character.  There are a few exceptions like house
    deeds, but not many.  Changes to persistent worlds tend to occur
    in small amounts, and in rare locations.
  </p>

  <p>
    A fair number of MUDs will let objects sit around for essentially
    forever.  If they're removed, it's by the actions of other
    players, or of the world itself in some way.  This gives a more
    immediate sort of persistence, though respawns mean that the
    effect of the player is still pretty limited.  Monsters you kill
    will be back in a few minutes, items you take are the same way.
    Overall, it feels a bit like a syndicated television show where no
    problem is allowed to take more than thirty minutes to fix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Persistence comes in degrees.  The game existing after you leave
    (a la EverQuest) is the simplest degree of persistence.  As the
    player's actions have greater and greater long-term effect on the
    world, the degree of persistence is increased.  A somewhat
    persistent game will leave objects lying around until they're
    moved or cleaned up.  A more persistent world will fail to respawn
    monsters and items when they are killed or moved.  An
    exceptionally persistent world would allow the player to dig a
    hole in the ground, or build a building, or burn down a whole
    town, and the results of those actions would remain until the next
    person changes the area again by building, altering or destroying.
  </p>

  <p>
    But why would you do this in a MUD?  When the old stuff isn't
    going to be kept around for any time anyway, why bother to make it
    persist for years?  Why would you care?
  </p>

  <p>
    One answer is that you can make a much better game with
    persistence, but only if you abandon the constant resets that
    define so much of current hack-and-slash MUD-dom.  Imagine a game
    where monsters are spawned in some more dynamic way and wander
    around more freely.  Imagine a game where a monster, when you
    killed it, were to actually <i>die</i> and not pop back up in the
    same spot a few minutes later.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's the concept.  It's not the only concept.  There are other
    alluring possibilities that persistence allows, including simple
    things like burying a treasure in the forest and being able to dig
    it up months or years later.
  </p>

  <h3> Underpopulation </h3>

  <p>
    In a MUD, you reset objects and monsters constantly.  What if you
    didn't?
  </p>

  <p>
    But wouldn't your world be entirely depopulated after a few days?
    Not if there were another way to spawn monsters.  Normally, MUD
    monsters spawn in a single location and stay there unless they're
    molested.  However, if animals were to wander randomly in from the
    far edges of the forest, if orcs were to spawn in tunnels and only
    come to the surface from there, if townsmen had to train to become
    guards rather than having guards spring fully-formed from the
    dust...  Then a few clever players, by carefully placing NPCs and
    traps, would be able to <i>change</i> the balance of the world.
    Those orcs could be beaten back and the tunnels guarded by
    powerful NPCs or players, and there would be no orcs for some time
    (until villainous players intervened, perhaps).  Or the orcs could
    be herded toward the forest, making it more dangerous.  There are
    many variations, and the interesting combinations would increase
    exponentially as the world grew larger and more varied.
  </p>

  <h3> Player Logout </h3>

  <p>
    If a player logs out or disconnects, something must be done with
    his body.  If you make the player disappear, then there's no
    change in a persistent MUD.  But if you have the player become a
    'linkdead statue' or the like, remember that those statues will
    persist <i>forever</i> unless cleaned up.  So make sure there is
    some way for the players to go 'off camera' when they log out.
    Disappearing, player houses, gnomes carrying the statues away,
    whatever, as long as there's something.
  </p>

  <p>
    I suppose it could be argued that the 'most' persistent solution
    would be to have the characters remain logged on as NPCs, running
    shops, accomplishing tasks, or otherwise being part of the world.
    However, AI is simply not good enough at this point for that to be
    a reasonable and common solution, and players tend to take a very
    dim view of their character losing experience or items by being
    killed when they can't control the character.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other concerns with DGD's style of persistence, but they
    have nothing to do with game design.  You can read more about that
    <a href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">here</a> if you're
    interested.
  </p>

  <h3> Inflation </h3>

  <p>
    Standard MUDs have horrendous inflation.  Items and money just
    keep respawning with monsters or respawning separately.  As more
    and more money is poured into your game over weeks and years, it
    just keeps accumulating and object prices (usually) stay constant,
    so players quickly have far more buying power than they'll ever
    need.  There are only a few good items that are buyable, and more
    experienced players have, almost without exception, already bought
    them, then given enough money to your new players to let
    <i>them</i> buy them.
  </p>

  <p>
    A persistent MUD, by requiring more planning, may actually
    <i>help</i> with this problem.  If you just have creatures respawn
    or wander in and you never have any money leaving your economy,
    you've got the same problem.  But by having a more complicated
    spawning system, you also leave the possibility of merchants
    moving on, creatures stealing money and leaving the game area, and
    other money sinks.  If you have sensible ways to introduce
    creatures and valuable items into the economy, make sure you have
    a sensible way to remove them as well, or at least you understand
    enough economics to understand the effects on your game.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other standard 'sinks' include taxation, robbery, items wearing
    out, unattended items rotting away, and various NPCs scavenging or
    otherwise disposing of objects.
  </p>

  <h3> The Old Players' Club </h3>

  <p>
    A problem that nearly every MUD has to deal with is the Old
    Players' Club &mdash; the set of players who've been on your MUD
    for a very long time, and have ultrapowerful characters with all
    the best loot.  Some of them may even have older 'discontinued'
    items and skills that no longer appear in your MUD for balance
    reasons, but you just didn't have the heart to take from them.
  </p>

  <p>
    To a (very) small extent, these characters will go away on their
    own as the players quit your MUD.  And to a larger extent, these
    players are doing your MUD good, not harm.  But it's annoying for
    a new player to realize that it will take years for him to come
    close in power to these characters, especially if he'll be
    competing with them for equipment and experience, and even more so
    if player versus player combat is at all common in the MUD.  Also,
    <i>you</i> may not like them being able to casually give away
    equipment of tremendous power to newbies or helping them
    powerlevel.
  </p>

  <p>
    In that case, you again need sinks, but in this case for power or
    for players rather than for items or money.  One possibility is a
    'hall of fame' so that players can trade in their old characters
    for newer ones, but in return have their very powerful characters
    immortalized somewhere in the MUD.  If you're willing to risk
    player dissatisfaction, you can also have skill decay, like item
    decay, so that characters who can find no greater challenges in
    the MUD will still have to stay active if they want to maintain
    their great in-game power.  The combination of skill decay and
    item decay can <i>also</i> solve the problem of 'discontinued'
    items and skills remaining in the MUD, especially if discontinued
    items can't be repaired and discontinued skills can't be improved.
  </p>

  <h3> Persistent Games and Your Builders </h3>

  <p>
    Standard LPMUDs have initialization code in every object to set
    their datafields.  Rooms set exits this way, objects set their
    weight, et cetera.  A persistent MUD in <a
    href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">the DGD sense</a>, or one
    that saves and loads object data in some functionally similar way,
    allows a new and different trick for MUDs that <i>don't</i> work
    this way.
  </p>

  <p>
    If objects have data that persists over time, then builders can
    alter it.  For instance, you could give builders items or commands
    that would make objects heavier or lighter, which would be useful
    for fine-tuning puzzles involving weights and scales.  Builders
    could directly alter the description of an object when a typo was
    found with a &quot;set&quot; command on the command-line, if they
    so chose, rather than having to edit the LPC file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Standard initialization code prevents this.  If the object is
    initialized (for instance, by a reboot) then the modified weights
    or descriptions or whatever are lost.  Since reboots, if they
    occur at all, will occur daily or weekly, that would remove all
    use of this modification as a tool for builders.  So if your MUD
    is going to use persistence as a builder tool, you'll need to get
    rid of standard initialization code, or you'll need to make sure
    that it only ever runs once for a given object, and that the data
    is loaded and saved across reboots after that.  DGD-style
    persistence, mentioned above, does this pleasantly and
    transparently.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is also the matter of <a
    href="PlayerContent.html">player-created content</a>.  Having a
    policy on such content is necessary in a persistent world where
    the players can make direct modifications to the game world and
    those modifications might reasonably 'stick'.  If builders can use
    persistence for building, in some sense so can players.

|On this subject, one might wonder why it is that DGD doesn't
|have a mudlib that offers more than mudlibs for other drivers,
|since DGD offers so much more than other drivers. A few musings
|on that subject follow.
|
|The biggest thing DGD offers, from a game perspective, is
|persistence. A game world can be altered by players and
|the alterations will remain. This is not the only feature
|in which DGD outstrips other drivers, but I think it's the
|one most visible to players of games running on DGD.
|
|Unfortunately, for the typical fantasy adventure, this is
|a drawback rater than a gain. After the player kills the
|goblin king, the game is over until the game resets and
|the goblin king magically springs back to life. Similarly
|for recovering lost treasures, rescuing princesses, and
|so forth. It is bad for the game, not good, if these
|things are permanent achievements.
|
|One can try to design features into the game to "explain"
|resetting of the game world, but that approach is counter
|to the idea of persistence. What's the use of using a
|persistent driver if all you're going to do is put
|non-persistent behavior back in via the game design?
|Also, the mechanisms needed to explain the resets within
|a consistent story line are complex.
|
|What DGD needs (needs in the public domain, anyway; Skotos
|is outside the scope of my comments here, and I'm not
|terribly familiar with it anyway - if someone who is
|wanted to comment on its relation to this topic, I think

|isn't traditional fantasy adventure and that uses persistence
|as a fundamental of the game design. DGD ought not try to
|compete on the tradition grounds of LPMud - its feature
|set inherently pulls it in a different direction.
|
|The reason traditional fantasy adventure works with resets
|is that the players are a small part of the game world
|anyway; they don't have important roles in the society
|in which the game is set. Thus, if their acts are
|impermanent, it doesn't matter much.
|
|The DGD "killer app" game should reverse that. Players
|should be important people in the society of the game
|world, capable of taking acts which alter that society,
|which are then reflected in the game world through the
|persistence of DGD. For example, building a castle
|which would then attract NPCs to form a town around it.
|Or destroying a castle and dispersing the town. Or
|something similar in whatever setting you do like, if
|you don't like fantasy adventure.

|Steve

Very nicely written!

I'd like to add my two cents to this thread by saying that you don't
have to have things as black or white.  The traditional mud is based
around resets and a facet/drain economy -- one where players "harvest"
mobs for gold, which is then drained away again by equipment,
training, and other in-game perks.  The ultimate result of this kind
of structure is the "level grind", where players are forced to kill
hundreds or thousands of the same kind of creature until they are
powerful enough to move on to the next area, and repeat the process
until they reach the plateau where no further content is available to
them.

A fully persistent world with NO resets and a fully closed economy
would, as Steve points out, require a constant staff of admins to
create new content on the fly, else the players would exhaust what
exists in the world and discover a virtual "heat-death" of the game.

To find a middle-ground, we need to try something new.  One idea I had
ages ago (and I'm sure many others have through of this too) is to
allow mobs to spawn and evolve in reaction to each other as well as
player activities.  That is, when you start the clock, the orcs in the
mountains will gradually start wandering, as will the goblins in the
forest.  At some point, they may encounter one another.  If they do,
they can either fight one another over resources, or ally themselves
for some other (coded) goal.  Maybe they both worship the same deity
and team up to further those ends.

In any case, when players start running into mobs, and killing them
for loot, the mobs shouldn't just die and reappear... but neither
should they be forever destroyed until a game master creates new
ones.  Allow for the idea that the event was witnessed.  If a band of
orcs gets killed near a city, perhaps a straggler watched and reported
back to camp.  Maybe the orcs will mass and attack the town if it
happens often enough, or maybe they will pick up and move further
away... allowing the city to expand, or a new enemy to move in.

Thus, persistence is maintained in the sense that if there was a
goblin camp near the city, that camp remains until it is destroyed or
packs up and moves away... and that it doesn't just reappear if
something happens.  But at the same time, nothing prevents new mobs
from moving into the area, either by the hand of a game master, or by
some code that decides a new tribe or orcs might be needed (as the orc
population is now too low, and the human population hasn't filled the
void).

I also totally agree that the players need to be more than cogs in the
wheel.  If the best you can hope for is to kill stuff to get more
equipment, to kill more stuff... you're in level-grind land, and may
as well toss out persistence.  In that respect, I think players need
to grow and shape the world alongside the game masters.  They should
be able to spend their wealth to build housing, and expand the city
borders.  Work to establish a new village somewhere, and set up trade
routes that need to be patrolled so the merchants (both NPC and
player) don't get ambushed by bandits (both NPC and player!).  Perhaps
players can engage in competition for nation-building as they (and
their guilds or other organizations) become really powerful (I'm
thinking along the lines of the old text game conquer, or empire).

So, the big question then is... how can we build a mudlib that allows
and encourages that kind of thing?  A persistent world that can still
evolve and populate itself without constant GM handholding, but which
can be micro-managed by a staff who wants a tight storyline to
develop?  I'm too much of a n00b at LPC to have any answers here, but
I 'd love to hear what other people think.

Subject: [DGD] Solving a Persistence Problem - Puzzles and Quest Objects
Date: Mon, 06 Sep 2004 14:15:00 -0500


In working with the Gurba lib, I've made a secondary goal to port over some 
of the classic adventure games, specifically the MIT Zork (Dungeon) and 
Colossal Cave.  In planning these ports, I realized a few of the biggest 
problems in converting what is essentially a single-player game to a 
multi-player platform.

Let me preface this by saying that this is -not- an argument against DGD or 
persistency; merely, I have run into some technical issues, and I bring 
these issues here because I am certain that some of you have come up with 
some elegant solutions.

1)  Puzzles have to be reset.  In a non-persistent mud (MudOS, LPMud), this 
is generally not a problem.  Rooms reset themselves, and when they do, the 
puzzles reset.  This is not the case with a persistent driver (DGD).

2)  Quest items/treasures have to be replaced.  This usually occurs during 
room resets.  Again, there are no room resets in DGD.

My first solution is;  once a quest item is picked up, it is automatically 
cloned and placed into the environment in which it was found, but now the 
new quest item is invisible to the person who picked it up.  I don't really 
like this solution, and it certainly doesn't address the problem of 
puzzles.  How do I make an object that, when picked up, it clones itself, 
and makes itself invisible, and the original remains visible to the person 
who picked it up?

My second solution was to invent a room reset feature for rooms that may 
contain puzzles or quest items.  These resets would reset the puzzle, or 
replace the taken quest/treasure item.  This seems like the most reasonable 
solution, but I am hopeful that there is a better one, because it doesn't 
keep the player from repeatedly getting the score for the same 
quest/treasure items over and over again.

My over-all goal is to provide a mechanism so that every person who plays 
through a particular area, can play through that area once, but if he 
should return, then that area will not yield useful quest/treasure 
items.  Which brings up a very important issue, in fact, a catch-22;

Unless there is an enormous amount of content to be had, certain quests 
have to be designed so that they can be repeated, over and over again.

The average playing time for the MIT Zork (Dungeon) area is 1 to 3 months 
(2 to 4 if not played obsessively).

The average playing time for the Adventure / Colossal Cave area is 1 to 3 
months (2 to 4 if not played obsessively).

That's a total of 2-6 months playing time - which doesn't seem like a lot 
to me - before new content would have to be introduced.

Any thoughts, ideas, solutions, etc., would be greatly appreciated...

  Yup.  That's it's own whole can of worms, all right.

  As you've said below, you *can* add regular resets to DGD.  This
means the quest can be completed repeatedly.  However, the quest's
benefit (good item, money, exp) does *not* have to be given repeatedly.
 For instance, in "Fedex" quests (bringing an item to a person), you
can have the person say (after the very first time), "sure, I'll take
it, but why are you bringing this to *me*?"  Then you don't have to
repeatedly award items or experience to the person.  You *do* have to
save "quest completed" flags for all the quests for every person, but
that's a smaller amount of data than you think.

  Another, more persistent, solution is to add "quest gremlins" of some
kind.  Maybe a lever is spring-loaded, maybe a shifting maze resets
itself when nobody has been in its area for an hour.  Maybe the birch
stick you need to wedge open the door will break eventually if left in
the door, and another birch stick will drop from the tree.  This is
more difficult, and requires more creativity in your puzzlemaking, but
it also yields a much more satisfying player experience for us
explorer-types :-)

  It also requires much more of an answer to "so why is this puzzle
still there, anyway?"  The answer, in one way or another, is that your
world maintains the puzzle.  When the puzzle stops being maintained,
*bam*, no more puzzle.

  Again, you can just reset.

  Again, you can add Quest Gremlins.  I include not only critters
(think of the little guys that picked up and moved tiles in the maze in
"Labyrinth"), but also special effects like the branch dropping from
the tree.

  This would be cute.  An alternative, even grander (and more
memory-hungry) idea would be to clone the entire puzzle area when a
person enters.  Then the person does the puzzle, gets a result, and
winds up with a final 'done' puzzle zone afterward.  This means the
player is required to do puzzles alone, and that there has to be only
one (or a very small number) of 'done' states for the puzzle.  An
example, partially lifted from CthulhuMUD:

  You have a haunted house.  You can enter the house and explore the
lower floors, read an old diary, see the moldy furniture, et cetera. 
At that point, if you leave, the puzzle resets and it'll be the same
next time you come in.  However, once you've entered the upper floors,
a Presence begins to follow you.  If you then exit, the puzzle will be
reset, but the Presence will do something mildly nasty to you on the
way out.

  However, if you've read the diary carefully or get lucky, you can
tweak a statue on the upper floors to open a secret door, which leads
to the corpse of the owner.  By taking the medallion he died with and
wearing it, you can avoid being hurt by the Presence.  However, if you
do that, then when you leave the house, the Presence will burn the
place down and you'll barely escape, taking damage on the way.  The
next time you wander by the house, it's been burned down and you can't
enter.

  This has the interesting effect that you'll see odd things when other
people *do* enter from the same street.  The group won't see each other
inside the house -- it's as though only you, alone, are there.  And it
means that the people for whom the house is burned down will *still*
see other people enter.

  You can decide if that's better or worse than having constant resets,
which are also deeply unrealistic.

  As with the quest flags, above, you have item flags that you save for
every player.  When the player picks up the item, set the item flag on
him.  Now he can no longer see it.  You'll do all this somewhere in the
routines where you describe your rooms and items.

> doesn't

  This is a constant problem in MUDs, and the cause of the constant
inflation that plagues almost every MUD everywhere.  Do you make your
MUD limited, and risk the players getting bored and leaving, or let
them do the same thing over and over for a reward, and guarantee
horrendous inflation?

  There's no good answer to that question.  Not yet.  With persistent
and random puzzle design, eventually there might be.

How about cloning it, and not moving it to the right place for,
say, 10 minutes or so? Effectively this delays the reset of the
question until the player is gone. It does make for a problem
if someone else shows up in the interim, or if the first player
doesn't leave, but it seems elegant otherwise.

You'll have to keep track of who has done what quest. Store that
data on the player, not on the room or in separate data file.
Otherwise you're asking for trouble with database maintenance.

This does mean you'll have to be able to add a new variable
to the player object whenever you bring a new quest up.

> Any thoughts, ideas, solutions, etc., would be greatly appreciated...

How about including some moderately random component to the quest,
so that the solution isn't the same all the time? For example, the
key item could be in any one of five different places. That means
the player who does it again has to solve a new variant (80% of
the time anyway) and it also cracks down on player 1 telling
player 2 how to solve the quest.

Following Stephen Schmidt and Noah Gibbs (and your) excellent suggestions, 
I compiled this result;

A "gremlin" (or, in my case, the Dungeon Master) has a fixed set of rooms 
which he will move to, one at a time, based on a fixed delay.  The rooms he 
moves to are rooms containing puzzles (or items required for puzzles), or 
quest items.
He resets the rooms to an untouched state.

The player can complete puzzles any number of times - but he will not 
receive a score for any completion past the first one.

Additionally, he can gather quest/treasure items, and return them to the 
"Trophy Case".  When he does, that quest/treasure item is recorded in a 
list, so that he can no longer gain points from that treasure (this 
mechanism is the same for solving puzzles).

If he encounters those items after he has scored points for them, he can 
see them, but he can no longer pick them up (an error message of, "you have 
already gathered this treasure, and find no interest in gathering it again").

However, he may still pick up items required to solve puzzles (this ability 
is still a subject for debate), and may still complete puzzles.  This is 
under the assumption that certain puzzles will unlock other areas of the 
game, which he may need access to.

The basic paradigm is for a "puzzle solving, treasure gathering" MUD, where 
the emphasis is on exploration and overcoming obstacles, rather than the 
"fight monsters/gather loot/fight bigger monsters" treadmill.

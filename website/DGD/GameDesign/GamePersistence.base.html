<h2>Persistence, As Applied to Game Design</h2>

<p><i>Most of the in-game aspects of this problem have been
discussed to death on MUD-Dev long ago. If you're really curious,
make sure to go read it. This is a good quick summary, but there's
more out there. Always.</i></p>

<p>The phrase 'persistent world' means a world that exists
more-or-less 24&frasl;7, whether you're there or not. The
implication is that some of the changes that you make to the world
may persist.</p>

<p>For a persistent world, it can be useful to have a <a href=
"../LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistent server</a>, though
that's not mandatory. You can have a non-persistent world on a
persistent server (EverQuest is almost this), or a persistent world
on a non-persistent server (certain MUDs are exactly this). You may
find it's <i>easier</i> to use a persistent server if you're going
to host a persistent game, though.</p>

<p>Current 'persistent worlds' aren't especially persistent.
Respawning tends to occur so rapidly that if you leave for an hour,
there's hardly any way to tell you were ever there except by
looking at your character. There are a few exceptions like house
deeds, but not many. Changes to persistent worlds tend to occur in
small amounts, and in rare locations.</p>

<p>A fair number of MUDs will let objects sit around for
essentially forever. If they're removed, it's by the actions of
other players, or of the world itself in some way. This gives a
more immediate sort of persistence, though respawns mean that the
effect of the player is still pretty limited. Monsters you kill
will be back in a few minutes, items you take are the same way.
Overall, it feels a bit like a syndicated television show where no
problem is allowed to take more than thirty minutes to fix.</p>

<p>Persistence comes in degrees. The game existing after you leave
(a la EverQuest) is the simplest degree of persistence. As the
player's actions have greater and greater long-term effect on the
world, the degree of persistence is increased. A somewhat
persistent game will leave objects lying around until they're moved
or cleaned up. A more persistent world will fail to respawn
monsters and items when they are killed or moved. An exceptionally
persistent world would allow the player to dig a hole in the
ground, or build a building, or burn down a whole town, and the
results of those actions would remain until the next person changes
the area again by building, altering or destroying.</p>

<p>But why would you do this in a MUD? When the old stuff isn't
going to be kept around for any time anyway, why bother to make it
persist for years? Why would you care?</p>

<p>One answer is that you can make a much better game with
persistence, but only if you abandon the constant resets that
define so much of current hack-and-slash MUD-dom. Imagine a game
where monsters are spawned in some more dynamic way and wander
around more freely. Imagine a game where a monster, when you killed
it, were to actually <i>die</i> and not pop back up in the same
spot a few minutes later.</p>

<p>That's the concept. It's not the only concept. There are other
alluring possibilities that persistence allows, including simple
things like burying a treasure in the forest and being able to dig
it up months or years later.</p>

<h3>Underpopulation</h3>

<p>In a MUD, you reset objects and monsters constantly. What if you
didn't?</p>

<p>But wouldn't your world be entirely depopulated after a few
days? Not if there were another way to spawn monsters. Normally,
MUD monsters spawn in a single location and stay there unless
they're molested. However, if animals were to wander randomly in
from the far edges of the forest, if orcs were to spawn in tunnels
and only come to the surface from there, if townsmen had to train
to become guards rather than having guards spring fully-formed from
the dust... Then a few clever players, by carefully placing NPCs
and traps, would be able to <i>change</i> the balance of the world.
Those orcs could be beaten back and the tunnels guarded by powerful
NPCs or players, and there would be no orcs for some time (until
villainous players intervened, perhaps). Or the orcs could be
herded toward the forest, making it more dangerous. There are many
variations, and the interesting combinations would increase
exponentially as the world grew larger and more varied.</p>

<h3>Player Logout</h3>

<p>If a player logs out or disconnects, something must be done with
his body. If you make the player disappear, then there's no change
in a persistent MUD. But if you have the player become a 'linkdead
statue' or the like, remember that those statues will persist
<i>forever</i> unless cleaned up. So make sure there is some way
for the players to go 'off camera' when they log out. Disappearing,
player houses, gnomes carrying the statues away, whatever, as long
as there's something.</p>

<p>I suppose it could be argued that the 'most' persistent solution
would be to have the characters remain logged on as NPCs, running
shops, accomplishing tasks, or otherwise being part of the world.
However, AI is simply not good enough at this point for that to be
a reasonable and common solution, and players tend to take a very
dim view of their character losing experience or items by being
killed when they can't control the character.</p>

<p>There are other concerns with DGD's style of persistence, but
they have nothing to do with game design. You can read more about
that <a href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">here</a> if you're
interested.</p>

<h3>Inflation</h3>

<p>Standard MUDs have horrendous inflation. Items and money just
keep respawning with monsters or respawning separately. As more and
more money is poured into your game over weeks and years, it just
keeps accumulating and object prices (usually) stay constant, so
players quickly have far more buying power than they'll ever need.
There are only a few good items that are buyable, and more
experienced players have, almost without exception, already bought
them, then given enough money to your new players to let
<i>them</i> buy them.</p>

<p>A persistent MUD, by requiring more planning, may actually
<i>help</i> with this problem. If you just have creatures respawn
or wander in and you never have any money leaving your economy,
you've got the same problem. But by having a more complicated
spawning system, you also leave the possibility of merchants moving
on, creatures stealing money and leaving the game area, and other
money sinks. If you have sensible ways to introduce creatures and
valuable items into the economy, make sure you have a sensible way
to remove them as well, or at least you understand enough economics
to understand the effects on your game.</p>

<p>Other standard 'sinks' include taxation, robbery, items wearing
out, unattended items rotting away, and various NPCs scavenging or
otherwise disposing of objects.</p>

<h3>The Old Players' Club</h3>

<p>A problem that nearly every MUD has to deal with is the Old
Players' Club &mdash; the set of players who've been on your MUD
for a very long time, and have ultrapowerful characters with all
the best loot. Some of them may even have older 'discontinued'
items and skills that no longer appear in your MUD for balance
reasons, but you just didn't have the heart to take from them.</p>

<p>To a (very) small extent, these characters will go away on their
own as the players quit your MUD. And to a larger extent, these
players are doing your MUD good, not harm. But it's annoying for a
new player to realize that it will take years for him to come close
in power to these characters, especially if he'll be competing with
them for equipment and experience, and even more so if player
versus player combat is at all common in the MUD. Also, <i>you</i>
may not like them being able to casually give away equipment of
tremendous power to newbies or helping them powerlevel.</p>

<p>In that case, you again need sinks, but in this case for power
or for players rather than for items or money. One possibility is a
'hall of fame' so that players can trade in their old characters
for newer ones, but in return have their very powerful characters
immortalized somewhere in the MUD. If you're willing to risk player
dissatisfaction, you can also have skill decay, like item decay, so
that characters who can find no greater challenges in the MUD will
still have to stay active if they want to maintain their great
in-game power. The combination of skill decay and item decay can
<i>also</i> solve the problem of 'discontinued' items and skills
remaining in the MUD, especially if discontinued items can't be
repaired and discontinued skills can't be improved.</p>

<h3>Persistent Games and Your Builders</h3>

<p>Standard LPMUDs have initialization code in every object to set
their datafields. Rooms set exits this way, objects set their
weight, et cetera. A persistent MUD in <a href=
"../LibWriting/Persistence.html">the DGD sense</a>, or one that
saves and loads object data in some functionally similar way,
allows a new and different trick for MUDs that <i>don't</i> work
this way.</p>

<p>If objects have data that persists over time, then builders can
alter it. For instance, you could give builders items or commands
that would make objects heavier or lighter, which would be useful
for fine-tuning puzzles involving weights and scales. Builders
could directly alter the description of an object when a typo was
found with a "set" command on the command-line, if they so chose,
rather than having to edit the LPC file.</p>

<p>Standard initialization code prevents this. If the object is
initialized (for instance, by a reboot) then the modified weights
or descriptions or whatever are lost. Since reboots, if they occur
at all, will occur daily or weekly, that would remove all use of
this modification as a tool for builders. So if your MUD is going
to use persistence as a builder tool, you'll need to get rid of
standard initialization code, or you'll need to make sure that it
only ever runs once for a given object, and that the data is loaded
and saved across reboots after that. DGD-style persistence,
mentioned above, does this pleasantly and transparently.</p>

<p>There is also the matter of <a href=
"PlayerContent.html">player-created content</a>. Having a policy on
such content is necessary in a persistent world where the players
can make direct modifications to the game world and those
modifications might reasonably 'stick'. If builders can use
persistence for building, in some sense so can players.</p>

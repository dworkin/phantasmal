  <h2> Persistence, As Applied to Game Design </h2>

  <p> <i>
      Most of the in-game aspects of this problem have been discussed
      to death on MUD-Dev long ago.  If you're really curious, make
      sure to go read it.  This is a good quick summary, but there's
      more out there.  Always.
  </i> </p>

  <p>
    The phrase 'persistent world' means a world that exists
    more-or-less 24&frasl;7, whether you're there or not.  The
    implication is that some of the changes that you make to the world
    may persist.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a persistent world, it can be useful to have a <a
    href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistent server</a>,
    though that's not mandatory.  You can have a non-persistent world
    on a persistent server (EverQuest is almost this), or a persistent
    world on a non-persistent server (certain MUDs are exactly this).
    You may find it's <i>easier</i> to use a persistent server if
    you're going to host a persistent game, though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Current 'persistent worlds' aren't especially persistent.
    Respawning tends to occur so rapidly that if you leave for an
    hour, there's hardly any way to tell you were ever there except by
    looking at your character.  There are a few exceptions like house
    deeds, but not many.  Changes to persistent worlds tend to occur
    in small amounts, and in rare locations.
  </p>

  <p>
    A fair number of MUDs will let objects sit around for essentially
    forever.  If they're removed, it's by the actions of other
    players, or of the world itself in some way.  This gives a more
    immediate sort of persistence, though respawns mean that the
    effect of the player is still pretty limited.  Monsters you kill
    will be back in a few minutes, items you take are the same way.
    Overall, it feels a bit like a syndicated television show where no
    problem is allowed to take more than thirty minutes to fix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Persistence comes in degrees.  The game existing after you leave
    (a la EverQuest) is the simplest degree of persistence.  As the
    player's actions have greater and greater long-term effect on the
    world, the degree of persistence is increased.  A somewhat
    persistent game will leave objects lying around until they're
    moved or cleaned up.  A more persistent world will fail to respawn
    monsters and items when they are killed or moved.  An
    exceptionally persistent world would allow the player to dig a
    hole in the ground, or build a building, or burn down a whole
    town, and the results of those actions would remain until the next
    person changes the area again by building, altering or destroying.
  </p>

  <p>
    But why would you do this in a MUD?  When the old stuff isn't
    going to be kept around for any time anyway, why bother to make it
    persist for years?  Why would you care?
  </p>

  <p>
    One answer is that you can make a much better game with
    persistence, but only if you abandon the constant resets that
    define so much of current hack-and-slash MUD-dom.  Imagine a game
    where monsters are spawned in some more dynamic way and wander
    around more freely.  Imagine a game where a monster, when you
    killed it, were to actually <i>die</i> and not pop back up in the
    same spot a few minutes later.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's the concept.  It's not the only concept.  There are other
    alluring possibilities that persistence allows, including simple
    things like burying a treasure in the forest and being able to dig
    it up months or years later.
  </p>

  <h3> Underpopulation </h3>

  <p>
    In a MUD, you reset objects and monsters constantly.  What if you
    didn't?
  </p>

  <p>
    But wouldn't your world be entirely depopulated after a few days?
    Not if there were another way to spawn monsters.  Normally, MUD
    monsters spawn in a single location and stay there unless they're
    molested.  However, if animals were to wander randomly in from the
    far edges of the forest, if orcs were to spawn in tunnels and only
    come to the surface from there, if townsmen had to train to become
    guards rather than having guards spring fully-formed from the
    dust...  Then a few clever players, by carefully placing NPCs and
    traps, would be able to <i>change</i> the balance of the world.
    Those orcs could be beaten back and the tunnels guarded by
    powerful NPCs or players, and there would be no orcs for some time
    (until villainous players intervened, perhaps).  Or the orcs could
    be herded toward the forest, making it more dangerous.  There are
    many variations, and the interesting combinations would increase
    exponentially as the world grew larger and more varied.
  </p>

  <h3> Player Logout </h3>

  <p>
    If a player logs out or disconnects, something must be done with
    his body.  If you make the player disappear, then there's no
    change in a persistent MUD.  But if you have the player become a
    'linkdead statue' or the like, remember that those statues will
    persist <i>forever</i> unless cleaned up.  So make sure there is
    some way for the players to go 'off camera' when they log out.
    Disappearing, player houses, gnomes carrying the statues away,
    whatever, as long as there's something.
  </p>

  <p>
    I suppose it could be argued that the 'most' persistent solution
    would be to have the characters remain logged on as NPCs, running
    shops, accomplishing tasks, or otherwise being part of the world.
    However, AI is simply not good enough at this point for that to be
    a reasonable and common solution, and players tend to take a very
    dim view of their character losing experience or items by being
    killed when they can't control the character.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other concerns with DGD's style of persistence, but they
    have nothing to do with game design.  You can read more about that
    <a href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">here</a> if you're
    interested.
  </p>

  <h3> Inflation </h3>

  <p>
    Standard MUDs have horrendous inflation.  Items and money just
    keep respawning with monsters or respawning separately.  As more
    and more money is poured into your game over weeks and years, it
    just keeps accumulating and object prices (usually) stay constant,
    so players quickly have far more buying power than they'll ever
    need.  There are only a few good items that are buyable, and more
    experienced players have, almost without exception, already bought
    them, then given enough money to your new players to let
    <i>them</i> buy them.
  </p>

  <p>
    A persistent MUD, by requiring more planning, may actually
    <i>help</i> with this problem.  If you just have creatures respawn
    or wander in and you never have any money leaving your economy,
    you've got the same problem.  But by having a more complicated
    spawning system, you also leave the possibility of merchants
    moving on, creatures stealing money and leaving the game area, and
    other money sinks.  If you have sensible ways to introduce
    creatures and valuable items into the economy, make sure you have
    a sensible way to remove them as well, or at least you understand
    enough economics to understand the effects on your game.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other standard 'sinks' include taxation, robbery, items wearing
    out, unattended items rotting away, and various NPCs scavenging or
    otherwise disposing of objects.
  </p>

  <h3> The Old Players' Club </h3>

  <p>
    A problem that nearly every MUD has to deal with is the Old
    Players' Club &mdash; the set of players who've been on your MUD
    for a very long time, and have ultrapowerful characters with all
    the best loot.  Some of them may even have older 'discontinued'
    items and skills that no longer appear in your MUD for balance
    reasons, but you just didn't have the heart to take from them.
  </p>

  <p>
    To a (very) small extent, these characters will go away on their
    own as the players quit your MUD.  And to a larger extent, these
    players are doing your MUD good, not harm.  But it's annoying for
    a new player to realize that it will take years for him to come
    close in power to these characters, especially if he'll be
    competing with them for equipment and experience, and even more so
    if player versus player combat is at all common in the MUD.  Also,
    <i>you</i> may not like them being able to casually give away
    equipment of tremendous power to newbies or helping them
    powerlevel.
  </p>

  <p>
    In that case, you again need sinks, but in this case for power or
    for players rather than for items or money.  One possibility is a
    'hall of fame' so that players can trade in their old characters
    for newer ones, but in return have their very powerful characters
    immortalized somewhere in the MUD.  If you're willing to risk
    player dissatisfaction, you can also have skill decay, like item
    decay, so that characters who can find no greater challenges in
    the MUD will still have to stay active if they want to maintain
    their great in-game power.  The combination of skill decay and
    item decay can <i>also</i> solve the problem of 'discontinued'
    items and skills remaining in the MUD, especially if discontinued
    items can't be repaired and discontinued skills can't be improved.
  </p>

  <h3> Persistent Games and Your Builders </h3>

  <p>
    Standard LPMUDs have initialization code in every object to set
    their datafields.  Rooms set exits this way, objects set their
    weight, et cetera.  A persistent MUD in <a
    href="../LibWriting/Persistence.html">the DGD sense</a>, or one
    that saves and loads object data in some functionally similar way,
    allows a new and different trick for MUDs that <i>don't</i> work
    this way.
  </p>

  <p>
    If objects have data that persists over time, then builders can
    alter it.  For instance, you could give builders items or commands
    that would make objects heavier or lighter, which would be useful
    for fine-tuning puzzles involving weights and scales.  Builders
    could directly alter the description of an object when a typo was
    found with a &quot;set&quot; command on the command-line, if they
    so chose, rather than having to edit the LPC file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Standard initialization code prevents this.  If the object is
    initialized (for instance, by a reboot) then the modified weights
    or descriptions or whatever are lost.  Since reboots, if they
    occur at all, will occur daily or weekly, that would remove all
    use of this modification as a tool for builders.  So if your MUD
    is going to use persistence as a builder tool, you'll need to get
    rid of standard initialization code, or you'll need to make sure
    that it only ever runs once for a given object, and that the data
    is loaded and saved across reboots after that.  DGD-style
    persistence, mentioned above, does this pleasantly and
    transparently.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is also the matter of <a
    href="PlayerContent.html">player-created content</a>.  Having a
    policy on such content is necessary in a persistent world where
    the players can make direct modifications to the game world and
    those modifications might reasonably 'stick'.  If builders can use
    persistence for building, in some sense so can players.

How about cloning it, and not moving it to the right place for,
say, 10 minutes or so? Effectively this delays the reset of the
question until the player is gone. It does make for a problem
if someone else shows up in the interim, or if the first player
doesn't leave, but it seems elegant otherwise.

You'll have to keep track of who has done what quest. Store that
data on the player, not on the room or in separate data file.
Otherwise you're asking for trouble with database maintenance.

This does mean you'll have to be able to add a new variable
to the player object whenever you bring a new quest up.

How about including some moderately random component to the quest,
so that the solution isn't the same all the time? For example, the
key item could be in any one of five different places. That means
the player who does it again has to solve a new variant (80% of
the time anyway) and it also cracks down on player 1 telling
player 2 how to solve the quest.

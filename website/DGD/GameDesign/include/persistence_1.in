Subject: [DGD] Solving a Persistence Problem - Puzzles and Quest Objects
Date: Mon, 06 Sep 2004 14:15:00 -0500


In working with the Gurba lib, I've made a secondary goal to port over some 
of the classic adventure games, specifically the MIT Zork (Dungeon) and 
Colossal Cave.  In planning these ports, I realized a few of the biggest 
problems in converting what is essentially a single-player game to a 
multi-player platform.

Let me preface this by saying that this is -not- an argument against DGD or 
persistency; merely, I have run into some technical issues, and I bring 
these issues here because I am certain that some of you have come up with 
some elegant solutions.

1)  Puzzles have to be reset.  In a non-persistent mud (MudOS, LPMud), this 
is generally not a problem.  Rooms reset themselves, and when they do, the 
puzzles reset.  This is not the case with a persistent driver (DGD).

2)  Quest items/treasures have to be replaced.  This usually occurs during 
room resets.  Again, there are no room resets in DGD.

My first solution is;  once a quest item is picked up, it is automatically 
cloned and placed into the environment in which it was found, but now the 
new quest item is invisible to the person who picked it up.  I don't really 
like this solution, and it certainly doesn't address the problem of 
puzzles.  How do I make an object that, when picked up, it clones itself, 
and makes itself invisible, and the original remains visible to the person 
who picked it up?

My second solution was to invent a room reset feature for rooms that may 
contain puzzles or quest items.  These resets would reset the puzzle, or 
replace the taken quest/treasure item.  This seems like the most reasonable 
solution, but I am hopeful that there is a better one, because it doesn't 
keep the player from repeatedly getting the score for the same 
quest/treasure items over and over again.

My over-all goal is to provide a mechanism so that every person who plays 
through a particular area, can play through that area once, but if he 
should return, then that area will not yield useful quest/treasure 
items.  Which brings up a very important issue, in fact, a catch-22;

Unless there is an enormous amount of content to be had, certain quests 
have to be designed so that they can be repeated, over and over again.

The average playing time for the MIT Zork (Dungeon) area is 1 to 3 months 
(2 to 4 if not played obsessively).

The average playing time for the Adventure / Colossal Cave area is 1 to 3 
months (2 to 4 if not played obsessively).

That's a total of 2-6 months playing time - which doesn't seem like a lot 
to me - before new content would have to be introduced.

Any thoughts, ideas, solutions, etc., would be greatly appreciated...

Perhaps the killer app for DGD is simply a "Genesis"
type mud. A world that starts completely uncivilised
with no history, with a self-sustaining ecology (with
tree regrowth and such).  The players can then build
the world. The issue here is that the world needs to
be set up so that the actions of the players cannot
easily overload the ecology, either by being quite
large, or giving the world a fast "metabolism".  In a
way it would make the perfect initial mud lib -
although each mud using it would start the same,
players (and GMs) could sculpt the way the world
evolves.  

This idea can be combined with Dread's mob ecology
stuff quite nicely too.

The again, I am slightly enthalled with the whole
Genesis idea, ever since I made this Neverwinter

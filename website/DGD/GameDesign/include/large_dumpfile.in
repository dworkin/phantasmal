Yes, sort of --

	for each object ob in runtime,
		examine status(ob)[O_NSECTORS]

which returns the number of sectors taken up by the object's data
and, if it's a master copy, its program.

Unfortunately I think this only works for swapped-out data, so the
time to do it might be in a 0.001-second callout after calling the
swapout() kfun? If you want to get a mudlib-wide total, that is.

Dworkin?

Subject: [DGD] Dynamic inheritance

I've been thinking of possible solutions for dynamic objects. By dynamic
objects I mean objects whose type can be altered arbitrarily on the fly, for
example changing a sword into a door, or even making it be both. One
possible solution would be to have an object inherit all the possible type
objects and have flags determine the type(s) of the object, then simply
cloning everything from it. But I think storing data that might never be
used is an outrageous waste of resources.

I also thought of another possible solution, which I call dynamic
inheritance. It would allow the adding and removing of programs that the
original object inherits without destructing or recompiling it, having
effect only on the desired clone, not all the clones. This way I could alter
the object very easily and almost limitlessly. Althought there might be
drawbacks and inconsistences that haven't occured to me. Are there?

I could (and probably will) simulate this kind of behaviour by having
objects have a list of relevant "inheritables." So if I want to change a
sword into a door, I simply clone a new door object and associate it with
the original object. By overriding call_other to loop through the object's
list on a call to a function in the object, I could make them behave as if
they were merely a single object. I mention this just to show that dynamic
inheritance is not necessary for gaining the same result.

Any ideas?

I had similar reservations about using a single "superclass" object for 
these same reasons, but Mr. Winzell was kind enough to quote some skotos 
memory usage statistics that have convinced me that this isn't nearly the 
resource problem I thought it was going to be.  Perhaps he'd also be kind 
enough to post those statistics to this list.

If you still aren't convinced, I've been kicking around an idea for 
minimizing the memory 'waste' of such an inheritance scheme.  Consider a 
system where you have one blueprint object '/obj/thing.c' (THING) that 
inherits all the various modules (inheritables) that will handle all the 
various methods and data you'll be needing.  Instead of having these 
inheritables contain the data/code directly, you could have each inheritable 
have a single item of data, a lightweight object pointer. The various 
functions in the inheritable would pass off responsibility to the 
lightweight object for handling the calls when necessary and when the object 
pointer != nil, or do some default processing when it is nil. So, instead of 
having 300 variables not doing anything in 60 modules for each object, you 
have 60 object pointers not doing anything.  When you wanted to change the 
sword into a door, you'd just call some method on the sword to set the 
weapon inheritable's (or whatever inheritable handles an object's 
sword-ness) object pointer to nil (which I'm hoping the driver cleans up 
promptly).  Then you'd call some method on the sword to clone up the 
lightweight object associated with door-ness and call the various methods on 
the 'sword' to set the data of the door lightweight object.

First off, I'm not sure the gain (if this gets you any gain) from such a 
system would justify the extra overhead (extra call_others, at minimum).  
And beyond that, I'm not even sure this would actually end up saving you 
resources in the long run.  And I haven't considered whether such a system 
is even desireable from a design standpoint, given the limitations of 
lightweight objects.

I think you might be better off just burning the extra memory and saving 
yourself some unnecessary complexity.

Thousands of objects shouldn't be too much. IIRC we had tens of thousands of
objects floating around in some of our drivers at Skotos. I think we even
had to increase the max number of objects a couple times on the Castle 
Marrach driver. 

Par, hook us up with some memory statistics! :)

In the Skotos lib, all the in-game objects are a single class that
inherit every in-game object method. For instance, you can attack with a
salami or eat a sword, if you try hard enough ;-)

Par or Erwin can speak to the specifics of how we do what we do, but
there is a layman's article on the subject at
http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_20.html

Our biggest game at this point has close to 200,000 game objects. So I
certain wouldn't worry about thousands.

Had another thought on this subject, although if the big object stats are 
good it's likely to be unnecessary.

The idea works something like this.

Instead of inheriting code you use only a single master copy of the 
functions that 'inheritable' object has. When your clone object wishes to 
inherit those functions it makes a call to, for example, register() which 
returns a mapping containing a list of functions, and a list of variable 
names and types. Within the clone object you maintain a mapping of object 
arrays, string arrays, int arrays, objects, strings, ints etc. Then once 
the clone calls register() it stores all the information that the 
'inherited' object needs. Then have some processing to a) If present call 
the function in the clone or b) Search the list of functions to find which 
master object to call the function in.
It also means a lot more call_other() commands, which may not be a 
particularily good thing. However it does make it possible to change the 
'inherited' functions and data for a particular clone on the fly.

Once again I read through and see I haven't really explained that very well :>
I'll try to clarify.

Clone object:
contains:
an array inherited->list of inherited objects by filename
a mapping functions->[name of inherited object][function]
a mapping variables->[name of inherited object][variables] ->Seems this 
should be mixed.
a function add_inherit->calls register in the inherited object and sets 
everything up.
a function remove_inherit->reverse of add_inherit.
a function process->checks if function is present in clone or performs the 
correct call_other.

Inherited object:
function register->Returns a list of all functions and variables used in 
the inherited object.
Object contains only functions, not global variables.

No global variables because the inherited code can be used by multiple 
clones so any globals would  cannot be guaranteed to relate to the calling 
clone.
The call_other in the clone passes the required variables in by reference, 
ie as pointers, so that the inherited code works on the actual values not 
copies of them. So when calling a function in the inherited object you pass 
over a reference to all the variables it registered in the clone object 
(using that variables mapping).

I don't know how clearly I've managed to explain that, hopefully enough 
that you can fill in the blanks. As I said at the top if the stats on 
having one big object are good then this is probably just unnecessary 
complexity.

Well, I think 'statistics' is rather too glorious a term for what
I wrote you... I mostly dismissed the consideration as rather less
than urgent, considering the power of modern machines. Marrach has
upwards of 200K objects, and the statedump is about 800 MB. That's
trivially within the reach of the cheapest of disks. Dumping state
to disk does eat up just about as much disk I/O as it's possible to
throw at it, but ATA/100 is a fast, dirt-cheap technology, and IDE
disks are very fast for this sort of thing these days.

On the other hand, probably 95% of that statedump consists of data
associated with 'THING' clones (that's not statistics, by the way,
just a guess). And, if you examine all those 200K clones a little
more closely, you will find that the vast, vast majority of them
are almost completely empty -- unconfigured. This is because we've
implemented data inheritance; if I buy a short sword at the shop,
I get an empty THING clone with a pointer to an 'ur-short-sword',
and any data lookups doing on my sword pass right through it and
become lookups instead on the ur-sword.

So... assuming the vast majority of our objects are THINGs -- and
the vast majority of those are empty -- then obviously the number
of actual global variables in each THING -- as opposed to actual
data contents -- is the most important factor in determining how
much memory the objects use.

Yes, precisely. This is my favourite approach to dealing with this
problem as the amount of functionality in each THING increases and
the number of objects approach several million. The traditional
way to solve the problem is to give each THING a single 'property'
mapping and store everything as properties -- but the LWO solution
is much better for most purposes, I think.

The most complex possibility we've been kicking around in Skotos
is a combination of data inheritance and a version of your LWO
idea: a THING has a number of object pointers; one for each major
branch of functionality -- a 'combat configuration' object, one
for shape/race, perhaps, one for clothing, ... and then let each
of these objects also participate in ur-object data inheritance
chains, so that it's very easy to configure an object with basic
building blocks -- you inherit the cow shape/race configuration,
the bovine combat brain, ...

Wesley should find these ideas familiar. :-)

In our cases, it would be a vast gain. I suspect we may well end
up cutting the size of our statedump in half at least if we did
it right now. However, I don't really care about the size of our
statedump at the moment. :-)

A trivial computation: with 250K objects and 32-byte data structs,
each new global variable added to THING will cost you at least 1M
of statedump. Our THING has well over a hundred variables, and a
fair amount of those are also initialized to ({ }) or ([ ]). So
we probably waste upwards of 200 MB. OK, so that's just a quarter.

Anyway... :-)

Yes. For now.

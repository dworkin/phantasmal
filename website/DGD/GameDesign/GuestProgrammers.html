  <h2> Programming By Guests and Players </h2>

  <p>
    In some MUDs, everybody can program.  Look at MUSHes, for
    instance.  In other MUDs, only trusted 'craftsman' players can
    program, and only in highly restricted ways.  Think of clan halls,
    for instance.  In other MUDs, only builders and administrators can
    program.  And in still others, not even builders can.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll need to decide how much programming your MUD allows people
    to do.  Remember that restricting player programming only helps
    security so much...  They can still make macros or bots to do
    repetitive operations for them, which you may not allow as policy,
    but are hard to prevent 100% of the time.

There is no performance penalty.  The limit exists for muds with guest
programmers.

Yes, sort of --

	for each object ob in runtime,
		examine status(ob)[O_NSECTORS]

which returns the number of sectors taken up by the object's data
and, if it's a master copy, its program.

Unfortunately I think this only works for swapped-out data, so the
time to do it might be in a 0.001-second callout after calling the
swapout() kfun? If you want to get a mudlib-wide total, that is.

Dworkin?

There is no need to wait for DGD to run out of sectors.  It will run out
of memory, and crash.

This is part of the LPmud heritage.  The attack in its classical form is

    str = "foo";
    for (;;) {
	str += str;
    }

DGD has a limit on string length, which helps to prevent accidental
mistakes.  But there is no good way to stop this attack in the mudlib,
unless you go the LPMOO route.  Otherwise it would require driver
support, and even then it would get very tricky.  The driver would have
to know about resource owners, not just for objects but for individual
strings and arrays.  An attacker could probably still cause significant
problems for a mud by staying just within the limits, or by causing this
to happen within badly-coded objects owned by other people.  To prevent
the latter, a completely different runtime model would be needed, such
as the process model in Unix.

I used to worry about this, but in the end I decided that LPC's
object/runtime model just doesn't lend itself to this type of security.
Instead, I concentrated on making it easier to identify an attacker
(or bumbling programmer) with object ownership and file security.

To sum it up: either trust your guest programmers, or give them only a
very limited, sandboxed environment.

Dworkin

The syntax is: rlimits (depth; ticks) { ... }

Yes.

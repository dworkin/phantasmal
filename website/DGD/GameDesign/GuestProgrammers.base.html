<h2>Programming By Guests, Players and Builders</h2>

<p>In some MUDs, everybody can write little programs and run them
somehow. Look at MUSHes, for instance, and how their object
creation works. In other MUDs, only trusted 'craftsman' players can
program, and only in highly restricted ways. Think of clan halls,
for instance. In other MUDs, only builders and administrators can
program at all. And in some, not even builders can - look at simple
DikuMUDs or CircleMUDs, for instance.</p>

<p>You'll need to decide how much programming your MUD allows
people to do. Remember that restricting player programming only
helps security so much... Players can still make macros or bots to
do repetitive operations for them. You may not allow macros or
bots, but they're hard to prevent 100% of the time.</p>

<p>One of the large problems with letting players write or run code
on your MUD is that it can cause DGD to <a href=
"../Running/DGDCrash.html">crash in certain situations</a>. You'll
need to figure out how to keep that from happening. For instance,
if only builders can write code for your MUD, you're fairly safe -
especially if you can find out who crashed the MUD after the fact.
But if anonymous guests can crash your MUD, you have a problem.</p>

<h3>Limiting Processor Time and Stack Space</h3>

<p>One of the ways DGD allows you to limit programs is with the
<a href="../LibWriting/Rlimits.html">rlimits()</a> statement.
You'll need to decide how long you can afford to let your MUD hang
if bad code happens. For code written by a random anonymous guest,
you probably want to give no longer than a small fraction of a
second. For builders, you may choose to be more lenient. Still,
remember that these things add up - if a builder makes an object
that can stall your whole MUD for half a second, you don't want to
let players get sixty of the objects and stall your MUD completely
for half a minute.</p>

<p>The Kernel library has resource limits on ticks. If you manage
your scripts correctly, the Kernel will make sure that no builder's
scripts take up too much time. Understand these limits and how they
work. If you use the Kernel Library, use them appropriately. If you
don't use the Kernel Library, build some similar facility into your
own library.</p>

<h3>Limiting Memory Space</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, malicious players can still crash DGD by using up
all your free memory in an LPC program. You can't stop them while
letting them run unrestricted LPC. However, there are some limits
built into DGD so that innocent players won't accidentally cause
the same problem in most cases.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library keeps track of how large objects and files
are, and its resource limits can be set to keep an administrator
from making DGD objects that are too large. This allows DGD to
determine when too much memory is being used and free it, if
necessary. Have a look at how the Kernel Library does this, and
either use the Kernel or build some similar facility into your own
library.</p>

<p>Similarly, you should periodically <a href=
"../LibWriting/Cleanup.html">clean up abandoned objects in
memory</a>, especially from guest programmers.</p>

<p>DGD has a maximum size for arrays and mappings. You can always
have more items in a collection than this - use an array of arrays
or a mapping of arrays, for instance. However, this keeps a simple
loop from making an infinitely large array accidentally. Similarly,
DGD strings have a maximum size. Neither will normally cause any
performance penalty, and both make it harder for innocent guest
programmers to crash DGD due to lack of memory.</p>

<h3>Limiting Operations</h3>

<p>None of this does any good if players can easily overwrite all
your files, or destroy all your data in memory. Luckily, DGD allows
you to <a href="../LibWriting/LargeAuto.html">write an AUTO
object</a>, which will let you change the behavior of all DGD's
functions. You can use this to prevent operations that the guest
code should be allowed to perform. If you're using the Kernel
Library, you can easily <a href="../Kernel/SecondAuto.html">change
the AUTO object for only certain code</a>, which can make security
even easier.</p>

<p>Since <a href="../Programming/CallOut.html">the call_out()
function</a> is one of the ones you can change in the AUTO object,
you can easily alter what functions guest code can call. You can
also alter what objects can be returned to guest code by
<b>find_object()</b>, which can prevent guest code from calling
functions on privileged objects.</p>

<h3>Extreme Solutions</h3>

<p>Certain libraries like LPMOO take guest code and translate it
into rather different LPC code. There are similar solutions for
compiling LPC in nonstandard ways. This allows you to address all
problems above, because you can define how your own language deals
with running out of processor time or memory space.</p>

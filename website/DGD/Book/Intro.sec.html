@@SECTION Introduction

<p>
  This is a book about a piece of software.  Like most of the O'Reilly
  books, it's an explanation of how to use a powerful tool, and like
  those books, it assumes you come to the table with a certain amount
  of experience and ability.
</p>

<p>
  DGD is an interpreter and network server for a language called LPC.
  LPC is strongly based on C, but has object-oriented extensions, so
  in concept the language is a bit like Java, Objective C or C++.
  However, LPC was designed for a game environment and used there for
  many years.  Its history as a game scripting language caused it to
  evolve in some very different directions than those other C-based
  languages.
</p>

<p>
  Since LPC is strongly C-based, you'll do best if you already have a
  certain amount of background in the C language.  You'll also do just
  fine if you know a bit of a C-like language, such as C++ or Java.
  If you need to learn C then &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;,
  by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, makes a fine companion volume
  to this book.  It's one of the first books on C and one of the best.
  I especially recommend the second edition.
</p>

<p>
  DGD has a strong background for code security.  Specifically, DGD
  and the LPC language are designed to allow for people of
  questionable skill and intent running their own code on your server.
  As a result, they include many configurable limits on execution
  time, stack depth, object size and operation privilege.  Where DGD
  limits these things for purposes of security, this book will try to
  note that fact.  You'll find that few of these limits are genuinely
  arbitrary, and that most are quite well thought-out.  Where your
  author believes the limits to be basically arbitrary, that too may
  be noted.
</p>

<p>
  LPC comes from the LPMUD community originally.  Even projects like
  DGD and Pike that now exist partially or wholly outside that
  community still reflect its influence in many ways.  DGD is only
  partially separate from the LPMUD community.  Much public discourse
  about DGD reflects that fact.  This book, like DGD itself, attempts
  to be a hybrid.  It is written to be maximally useful to those who
  are building a MUD or similar game on top of DGD.  But everything
  written here should be useful in one way or another for non-game
  applications.  This volume is very much on the topic of DGD and LPC,
  but is only partially on the topic of MUDs and their implementation.

<p>
  There are several forms of special text that you'll see in this
  book.  Anything that you type into a terminal client for DGD will be
  written like this: <kbd>grant andy access</kbd>.  Filenames,
  including DOS/Windows-style and Unix-style, are written as
  <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt> or <tt>C:\Programs\DGD\doc\kfun</tt>.  Sample
  output from DGD to you is written like this: <samp>DGD version
  1.2p4</samp>.  New terms in the index will appear like
  <dfn>this</dfn>.  If you don't see anything different, then your
  edition of this book doesn't mark them specially.  Variables and
  keywords in DGD's dialect of LPC will be written as
  <var>variable</var>.  Generic code that doesn't quite fit into any
  of the above categories will be written <code>like this</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This book will try to use phrases like &quot;he or she&quot; and
  abbreviations like s/he where appropriate.  However, they are
  omitted in places for brevity or to improve the clarity and flow of
  the text.  In no case is any slight meant to any genders (including
  the neuter) that aren't explicitly mentioned in a particular
  passage.  Players of any race, religion, creed, lifestyle, gender,
  color, accent, education level, shoe size and condiment preference
  are heartily welcomed.  We can use them.

@@SECTION Introduction

<p>
  This is a book about a piece of software.  Like most of the O'Reilly
  books, it's an explanation of how to use a powerful tool, and like
  those books, it assumes you come to the table with a certain amount
  of experience and ability.

<p>
  DGD is an interpreter and network server for a language called LPC.
  LPC is strongly based on C, but has object-oriented extensions, so
  in concept the language is a bit like Java, Objective C or C++.
  However, LPC was designed for a game environment and used there for
  many years.  Its history as a game scripting language caused it to
  evolve in some very different directions than those other C-based
  languages.

  Since LPC is strongly C-based, you'll do best if you already have a
  certain amount of background in the C language.  You'll also do just
  fine if you know a bit of a C-like language, such as C++ or Java.
  If you need to learn C then &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;,
  by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, makes a fine companion volume
  to this book.  It's one of the first books on C and one of the best.
  I especially recommend the second edition.

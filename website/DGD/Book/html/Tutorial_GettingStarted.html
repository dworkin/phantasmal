<h2> 2.1 Getting Started </h2>


<p>
  Now that you have the Kernel Library running, it's time to start
  learning some simple LPC code.  There are two ways to test your LPC
  code with the Kernel Library.  We'll start with the simpler of the
  two, which is called the &quot;code&quot; command.
</p>

<p>
  Log in as admin, if you haven't already.  Type <kbd>code 7+4</kbd>.
  You should see a response like <samp>$0 = 11</samp>.  The $0 is a
  value that DGD will store for you.  You can refer to it later
  whenever you like.  For instance, if you typed <kbd>code $0+9</kbd>,
  you'd see a result like <samp>$1 = 20</samp>.  Note that this time
  the history value is $1, not $0.  $0 keeps its old value, and a new
  history item, $1, gets the new value.  The history number will keep
  increasing as you perform commands that place values into the
  history list.
</p>

<p>
  Next try typing <kbd>code status()[ST_VERSION]</kbd>.  Note the
  opening and closing parentheses go <em>before</em>
  &quot;ST_VERSION&quot; in square brackets.  If you do it right,
  you'll get the current version of DGD, such as &quot;DGD
  1.2.70&quot;, returned between quotation marks, and of course
  assigned to a history number like $2.
</p>

<p>
  The parentheses after a name mean to call a function by that name.
  Anything between the parentheses are the <dfn>arguments</dfn> of the
  function, also called parameters.  For instance, try typing
  <kbd>code sin(2.0 * 3.14159)</kbd>.  You should get a result like
  <samp>$3 = -5.3071519e-6</samp>.  Whatever result you get, it should
  be a very small number, like the above.  That's because you're
  calculating the sine of two pi, which (if calculated absolutely
  perfectly) is zero.  Now try typing the same thing, but with 2
  instead of 2.0.  If you're used to programming in C, the result may
  surprise you!
</p>

<p>
  It turns out that ST_VERSION, in the example with status(), is
  actually a number.  The code command defines certain constant values
  for you, and assigns names to them.  So if you type simply <kbd>code
  ST_VERSION</kbd>, you should see the numerical value of ST_VERSION,
  0, printed out.  That's because underneath, ST_VERSION is just the
  number 0.  We've assigned a value to it using the C Preprocessor, a
  very powerful part of the language that will be described in a later
  chapter.
</p>

<p>
  The code command is very powerful, but very limited.  It's very
  powerful because you can use it to evaluate any valid LPC code.
  It's very limited because you have to put all the code on a single
  line, and because it's hard to save old code commands to use again.
  This tutorial will use it to teach you the basics of LPC.  Later,
  you'll find out how to put LPC code into files and compile those
  files into programs and objects.

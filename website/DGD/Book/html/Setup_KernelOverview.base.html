<h2> 2.3 An Overview of the Kernel Library </h2>


<p>
  To use the Kernel Library, you'll need a quick overview of what you
  can do with it.  This entire section applies only to the unmodified
  Kernel Library -- any of this can be changed.  But when you start, this
  section describes how the interface works.
</p>

<p>
  You can quit by typing <kbd>quit</kbd>, which is useful to know.
  You can chat with others on the server by typing <kbd>say</kbd>, a
  space, and what you want to say.  This will send the message to
  everyone else currently logged in.  You can type <kbd>people</kbd>
  to see who is currently logged in.  All of these operations can be
  performed by any user.
</p>

<p>
  The admin user can also type <kbd>shutdown</kbd> to shut down the
  server.  He can also use the &quot;code&quot; command, which you'll
  learn about in the next chapter.
</p>

<p>
  The Kernel Library actually has a number of other commands, most of
  them only for administrators, not players.  Those will be covered
  later as we need them.

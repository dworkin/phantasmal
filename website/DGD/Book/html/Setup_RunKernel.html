<h2> 1.2 Running the Kernel Library </h2>


<p>
  To do most of the exercises in this book, you'll need to be able to
  run the Kernel Library.  Luckily, a copy comes with every copy of
  DGD.  So if you've already installed DGD, you've already installed
  the Kernel.
</p>

<p>
  Your copy of DGD came with a file called &quot;mud.dgd&quot;.  Look
  in DGD's directory and you should find it pretty quickly.  You'll
  need to edit that file before you can use it.
</p>

<p>
  In that file, you'll see various lines assigning values to various
  words.  One of them will say something like <code>directory =
  &quot;/home/dworkin/dgd/mud&quot;</code>.  You'll need to change
  that path to the <tt>mud</tt> subdirectory of the absolute path of
  the directory where you installed DGD.  For instance, if you
  installed DGD into <tt>~alan/dgd</tt> on your Unix system, you'd
  change the filename in quotes to <tt>/home/alan/dgd/mud</tt>.  If
  you installed DGD into <tt>C:\Programs\DGD</tt> on your Windows
  machine, you'd change the line to <code>directory =
  &quot;C:\Programs\DGD\mud&quot;</code>.  The end of the line, the
  part surrounded by stars and slashes, is a comment.  You can ignore
  it.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the path has to be an <em>absolute</em> path.  That means
  you have to start it with a slash or a backslash or a tilde or a
  drive specifier, depending on your platform.  But you <em>can't</em>
  just start it with a subdirectory of the directory where you
  installed DGD, that won't work.  No relative paths.  So
  <tt>/home/bob/dgd</tt> is fine, but <tt>DGD\MUD</tt> isn't.
</p>

<p>
  Once you've done that, you'll need to run the DGD program.  If
  you're running on Windows and you compiled with Visual C++, you can
  run it by itself and then choose the mud.dgd program from the menu.
  If you compiled on Unix or used the Cygnus tools on Windows, you'll
  need to run the program from the command line, with the .dgd file as
  an argument.  For instance, from Unix, in the DGD directory, you might
  type <kbd>./bin/driver mud.dgd</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
  If you've done it correctly, DGD will print messages about what
  version you're running and various other things, then it will sit
  and do nothing.  If you're not used to running your own MUD server,
  this can be a bit disconcerting.  Don't worry, it's normal.  In
  fact, if DGD stops and goes back to the command line (normally with
  an error message), <em>that</em> would be abnormal.  The messages
  you should expect will look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** DGD 1.2.73
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** Initializing...
Jan 29 16:09:53 ** Initialization complete.
</pre>

<p>
  Once you're running the server, you'll need to telnet to your MUD.
  That requires a telnet client of some kind.  On unix, that normally
  means running telnet from the command line.  The syntax is simply
  <kbd>telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</kbd>, where host is the name
  or IP address of the host you're telnetting to, and port is the port
  number.  If you leave off the port number, telnet will use port 23
  by default, which is almost never what you want for a MUD.  On
  Windows, you'll want to download a MUD client like zMUD or a
  terminal program like TeraTerm or Putty.  Do a web search on any of
  those names, or just on 'Windows terminal program'.
</p>

<p>
  Telnet back to your own machine, on the port where DGD is running.
  Normally your machine's address will be 127.0.0.1 when you telnet to
  it, which is called the <dfn>localhost</dfn> address.  The Kernel
  Library will usually run on port 6047, though you can check the file
  <tt>mud.dgd</tt> to be sure.  You'll want to telnet to the telnet
  port, not the binary port, from that file.  Your telnet program will
  just connect to a telnet or SSH server if you don't tell it the
  correct port number.
</p>

<p>
  The Kernel Library will ask you for a login name.  Tell it you are
  <kbd>admin</kbd>.  Then choose a password for this account.  The
  admin account is special, and gets a lot of privileges that other
  accounts don't &mdash; you won't be able to do most of the exercises
  in this book except with a privileged account.  When you first set
  up the Kernel Library, the admin account is the only one.

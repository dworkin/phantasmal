<h2> 2.2 Running the Kernel Library </h2>


<p>
  You'll need to run the Kernel Library to do most of the exercises in
  this book.  A copy comes with every copy of DGD.  So if you've
  already installed DGD, you've already installed the Kernel.
</p>

<p>
  Your copy of DGD came with a file called <tt>mud.dgd</tt>.  Look in
  DGD's directory and you should find it pretty quickly.  You'll need
  to edit that file before you can use it.
</p>

<p>
  In <tt>mud.dgd</tt>, you'll see various lines assigning values to
  various names.  One line will say something like <code>directory =
  &quot;/home/dworkin/dgd/mud&quot;</code>.  You'll need to change
  that path to the absolute path for the directory where you installed
  the Kernel Library.  That's the <tt>mud</tt> subdirectory of DGD.
  For instance, if you installed DGD into <tt>~alan/dgd</tt> on your
  Unix system, you'd change the filename in quotes to
  <tt>/home/alan/dgd/mud</tt>.  If your DGD directory wound up in
  <tt>C:\Programs</tt> on your Windows machine, you'd change the line
  to <code>directory = &quot;C:\Programs\DGD\mud&quot;</code>.  The
  end of the line, the part surrounded by stars and slashes, is a
  comment.  You can ignore it or remove it entirely (including all the
  stars and slashes).
</p>

<p>
  Note that the path has to be an <em>absolute</em> path.  That means
  you have to start it with a slash on Unix.  You'd use a backslash or
  a drive letter on Windows.  But you <em>can't</em> just start it
  with the name of the directory where you installed DGD and leave out
  where on the drive that directory is, that won't work.  No relative
  paths.  So <tt>/home/bob/dgd/mud</tt> and
  <tt>C:\Programs\DGD\MUD</tt> are fine, but <tt>DGD\MUD</tt> isn't.
</p>

<p>
  Once you've done that, you'll need to run the DGD program.  If
  you're running on Windows and you compiled with Visual C++, you can
  run dgd by double-clicking it and then choose the mud.dgd program
  from the menu.  If you compiled on Unix or used the Cygnus tools on
  Windows, you'll need to run the program from the command line, with
  the .dgd file as an argument.  For instance, from Unix, in the DGD
  directory, you might type <kbd>./bin/driver mud.dgd</kbd>.  Note
  that while Win32 permits you to run DGD from the command line, you
  won't get proper error output if you do.  So it's recommended you
  run DGD and then choose a configuration file from the menu instead.
</p>

<p>
  If you've done it correctly then DGD will print messages about what
  version you're running and various other things.  Then nothing
  visible will happen.  If you're not used to running your own MUD
  server, this can be a bit disconcerting.  Don't worry, it's normal.
  In fact, if DGD stops and goes back to the command line (usually
  with an error message), <em>that</em> would be abnormal.  The
  messages DGD prints will look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** DGD 1.2.73
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** Initializing...
Jan 29 16:09:53 ** Initialization complete.
</pre>

<p>
  Once you're running the server, you'll need to telnet to your MUD.
  That requires a telnet client or MUD client.  On Unix, the simplest
  method is to run telnet from the command line.  The syntax is simply
  <kbd>telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</kbd>, where host is the name
  or IP address of the host you're telnetting to, and port is the port
  number.  If you leave off the port number, telnet will use port 23
  by default, which is almost never what you want for a MUD.
</p>

<p>
  On Windows, you'll want to download a MUD client like zMUD or a
  terminal program like TeraTerm or Putty.  Do a web search on one of
  those names, or just on 'Windows terminal program' or 'Win32 MUD
  client' or similar.
</p>

<p>
  Telnet back to your own machine, on the port where DGD is running.
  Normally your machine's address will be 127.0.0.1 when you telnet to
  it, which is called the <dfn>localhost</dfn> address.  The Kernel
  Library will usually start its telnet server on port 6047, though
  you can check the file <tt>mud.dgd</tt> to be sure.  You'll want to
  telnet to the telnet port, not the binary port, from that file.
  Your telnet program will attempt to connect to the wrong port if you
  don't tell it the correct port number.
</p>

<p>
  The Kernel Library will ask you for a login name.  Tell it you are
  <kbd>admin</kbd>.  Then choose a password for this account.  The
  admin account is special, and gets a lot of privileges that other
  accounts don't &mdash; you won't be able to do many of the exercises
  in this book except with a privileged account.

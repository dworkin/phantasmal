<h2> 3.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions </h2>


<p>
  The code command gives you constants like <var>ST_VERSION</var>.  It
  also gives you several other things, including a set of one-letter
  variables which it defines for you.
</p>

<p>
  A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a named piece of storage space.  A variable
  can hold a <dfn>value</dfn>, such as the integer 94 or the character
  string &quot;Bob's your uncle!&quot; (an integer is a whole number,
  either positive or negative, and a character string is a series of
  letters, numbers and punctuation like a word or a sentence).  The
  variable has a name that you use to refer to that storage.  The
  value of the variable may change over time.  For instance, you may
  add 2 to the variable, giving 96 instead of 94.  But the variable
  name will not change.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, type <kbd>code a = 94, a = a + 7, a</kbd>.  Make sure
  to type it as written, with the commas.  You should see a result
  like <samp>$7 = 101</samp>.  The commas are a special operator that
  means &quot;do the things in order, but only worry about the value
  of the <em>last</em> one&quot;.  So we did three things with that
  code statement.  We set the variable a to have the value 94.  Then
  we changed what a was equal to by setting it to its old value plus
  7.  Then, the very last part of the command, after the last comma,
  was a.  Since comma means &quot; only pay attention to the last one
  &quot;, the value returned was a's new value of 94 + 7, or 101.
</p>

<p>
  You can also separate statements with the semicolon.  Due to
  strangeness in the way the code command works, if you use the
  semicolon operator with the code command at all, you <em>must</em>
  finish your code with a semicolon or an end-curly-brace.  Otherwise
  you'll get very strange behavior indeed.  Try typing <kbd>code a =
  94; a = a + 7; return a;</kbd>.  You should get 101, the same result
  as above.  If you just get 94, you forgot the ending semicolon.  Try
  it again.  Note the 'return' statement at the end.  When you don't
  use a semicolon at the end of your code command, the Kernel Library
  assumes you're just writing a little expression and you want its
  value.  That's what you've been doing so far.  If you end your code
  command with a semicolon or an end-curly-brace then you'll need to
  include your own return statement if you want anything returned.
  The return statement does what the last statement after the comma
  did in the last paragraph.  Its value is what gets returned, and so
  that value is what gets assigned to a history variable like $9 or
  $26.
</p>

<p>
  A variable in LPC isn't exactly like a mathematical variable.  The
  equals sign above doesn't really mean equality in a mathematical
  sense.  Instead, the equals is often called <dfn>assignment</dfn>.
  It is setting the variable to have a value.  But unlike in
  mathematics, the variable can be repeatedly assigned, changing its
  value throughout your code.  A variable's value is the most recent
  value that has been assigned to it.
</p>

<p>
  You've already seen the <dfn>+</dfn> operator.  There's also a
  minus, <dfn>-</dfn> which works the way you'd expect &mdash; it can
  be used to make a number or variable negative, or to subtract two
  numbers.  The asterisk <dfn>*</dfn> means multiplication, and the
  forward-slash, <dfn>/</dfn> represents division.  Remember that you
  can only add, multiply, subtract or divide integers with integers
  and decimal numbers (also called floating point) with other floating
  point numbers.  If you try to do otherwise, such as by typing
  <kbd>code 7 + 4.1</kbd>, you'll get an error.  Try it and see.
</p>

<p>
  Most of DGD's operations give exactly the answer you'd expect, but
  division of integers sometimes doesn't.  If you divide, say, five by
  two, you'll find that DGD automatically rounds down to 2.  DGD will
  always round toward zero when you divide integers.  Test with the
  code command and see.
</p>

<p>
  Integers are limited in size.  If you try typing <kbd>code 10000 *
  10000 * 10000</kbd>, you'll see a strange result &mdash; it's
  negative!  That's because integers have a maximum value of a little
  more than four billion.  If your numbers get larger than that,
  they'll wrap back around.  Unsigned integer variables (we'll talk
  about them later) will wrap back to zero, while signed integer
  variables will wrap to negative numbers.  If you're subtracting or
  multiplying and your integer variable gets smaller than the smallest
  allowed number (around negative four billion) it will wrap back into
  being positive.  This wrapping is because DGD's basic numbers are of
  a fixed size, and there are only so many possible numbers that a
  single variable can represent.  If you need larger or smaller
  integers than that, you'll find that DGD's Arbitrary-Precision
  Signed Numbers (called ASNs) are the way to go.  They're explained
  in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>
  The code command gives you a set of variables with names like
  <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, et cetera.  You can also
  declare your own new ones.  Integer variables are declared to be of
  type <dfn>int</dfn>.  So you might type <kbd>code int sam; sam = 7;
  sam = sam + 4; return sam;</kbd>.  Note that you must declare the
  variables at the very beginning.  If you try typing <kbd>code a = 4;
  int sam; sam = 7;</kbd>, you'll get an error.  Variables can only be
  declared at the beginning of a block scope.  What that means to you
  right now is that if you use variables in your code statements, put
  them right up front.
</p>

<p>
  A note for users of the C language: in C, you could say <code>int
  sam = 7;</code> instead of <code>int sam; sam = 7;</code> and it
  would work fine.  DGD doesn't allow you to declare and initialize a
  variable in that way, so don't.
</p>

<p>
  Not every value or variable is an integer, so not every variable is
  declared using <code>int</code>.  You can also have
  <dfn>unsigned</dfn> variables, which are integers that can't hold
  negative values.  You can declare an unsigned variable called
  <var>bruno</var> by typing <code>unsigned int bruno;</code>, or just
  <code>unsigned bruno;</code> Try subtracting a larger unsigned
  number from a smaller one and see what happens!  The wraparound can
  be surprising if you're not used to it.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that decimal numbers or fractional numbers are called
  floating point numbers.  A floating point variable called
  <var>temperature</var> would be declared as <code>float
  temperature;</code>.  Remember that you can only add, subtract,
  multiply and divide floating point numbers with other floating point
  numbers, not with integers.  That means that to double a floating
  point number, you'd need to multiply it by 2.0 rather than just 2.

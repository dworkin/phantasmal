<h2> 3.4 Simple String Manipulation </h2>


<p>
  Some time back, we called the status() function, and extracted a
  result which wasn't a number at all.  It was a <dfn>string</dfn>,
  which is a set of character values, one after the other.  Of course,
  it doesn't usually look that way.  It usually looks like a word or
  phrase or paragraph.
</p>

<p>
  In DGD, just like in C, strings use what's called ASCII code.
  Computers represent everything with numbers internally.  So every
  printable character (and many special characters with no printable
  representation) must be assigned a number.  ASCII is one way to
  assign those numbers.  A DGD string is just a sequence of numbers,
  each representing a letter, number or other printable character.
</p>

<p>
  A DGD string can also hold the empty string, which is written as
  &quot;&quot;.  That's a sequence of <em>zero</em> characters, and it
  just means &quot;no string here&quot;.  The string can also hold the
  special value <dfn>nil</dfn>.  Every string holds <var>nil</var>
  when you first declare it.  So do certain other data types we'll
  talk about later.  <var>nil</var> isn't a valid string, it's just a
  placeholder meaning that the string isn't usable yet &mdash; you
  have to assign a value to it first.
</p>

<p>
  So go ahead and type <kbd>code &quot;Hello world!&quot;</kbd>.  You
  should see a result something like <samp>$15 = &quot;Hello
  world!&quot;</samp>.  The quotation marks around it mean that it's a
  string.  In LPC, a string is always double-quoted.
</p>

<p>
  Just as you can use operations like + and * on numbers, you can also
  use certain operators on strings.  For instance, the <dfn>+</dfn>
  operator will concatenate two strings into a single longer one.  Try
  typing <kbd>code &quot;Hello&quot; + &quot;World!&quot;</kbd>.  Note
  that you don't automatically get a space in between, so you should
  have seen a result like <samp>$18 = &quot;HelloWorld!&quot;</samp>.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that the string is made of a sequence of numbers which
  represent characters.  In LPC you can extract one of these numbers
  with the square-brace operator.  For instance, type <kbd>code
  &quot;A&quot;[0]</kbd>.  You should see a result like <samp>$20 =
  65</samp>.  That's because 65 is the ASCII encoding for an uppercase
  A.  Try using strings other than &quot;A&quot; and you can see more
  ASCII encodings.  You'll notice that all the uppercase letters are
  ordered alphabetically within themselves so B is 66, C is 67 and so
  on.  The lowercase letters do the same thing.
</p>

<p>
  The zero in braces, above, specifies what offset in the string to
  examine.  For instance, if you type <kbd>code
  &quot;FANDANGO&quot;[4]</kbd>, you'll get 65 also.  That's because
  the number is square brackets is what character of the string to
  examine, and character four corresponds to the fifth character,
  which is an uppercase A in the word &quot;FANDANGO&quot;.  The
  string's characters are numbered in order, starting with zero.
</p>

<p>
  You can also extract more than one character from a string.  But
  that can't just be an ASCII number.  So if you extract more than one
  character from a string, LPC gives you another string.  Try typing
  <kbd>code &quot;Big Bertha&quot;[0..2]</kbd>.  You should get the
  result &quot;Big&quot;.  That's characters number zero through two
  &mdash; the first through third characters.
</p>

<p>
  You'll find that if you substitute <code>[..2]</code> for
  <code>[0..2]</code>, it works exactly the same way.  Leaving off the
  first number means &quot;from the beginning of the string&quot;.
  Similarly, using <code>[3..]</code> would mean &quot;from the fourth
  character to the end of the string&quot;.  Perl and some LPC
  dialects let you specify negative numbers to measure from the end of
  the string, but DGD does not.  So you should only use positive
  numbers for your string offsets.
</p>

<p>
  You can also find the length of a string in characters.  For
  instance, type <kbd>code strlen(&quot;Bob's Aunt Polly&quot;)</kbd>.
  You should get a result like <samp>$24 = 16</samp>.  That's because
  the string contains sixteen characters &mdash; that includes the
  apostrophe and both spaces.  Character counting with strlen()
  includes punctuation and other special characters as well as letters
  and numbers.

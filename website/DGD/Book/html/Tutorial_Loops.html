<h2> 3.3 Looping and Iteration </h2>


<p>
  The LPC language is well-suited to math-intensive tasks, as you'd
  guess from the previous section.  For instance, let's say you wanted
  to find out how many times you'd have to double the number two
  before you got to some very high number.  That's something you could
  probably do in your head or on paper for small numbers.  But for a
  number like ten million, you're probably better off letting the
  computer do it.
</p>

<p>
  Try typing <kbd> code int times; int count; times = 0; count = 2;
  while(count &lt; 10000000) { count = count * 2; times = times + 1; }
  return times;</kbd> Note that you must <em>not</em> hit return until
  the very end &mdash; you have to type the whole thing on one line.
  If you do it right, you should get 23 as the answer.
</p>

<p>
  But is 23 the right answer?  Hard to tell.  So we should start with
  2 and double it 23 times, just to be sure.  Go ahead and type
  <kbd>code int times; int count; times = 0; count = 2; while(times
  &lt; 20) { count = count * 2; times = times + 1; } return
  count;</kbd>.  You should get the value 16777216 returned.  And yes,
  that's more than ten million.  So our code works!  Now, <em>how</em>
  does it work?
</p>

<p>
  You know about declaring variables and setting values, but
  <dfn>while</dfn> is a new one.  While takes a condition in
  parentheses, and then a bunch of stuff between curly braces.  The
  stuff in curly braces is done over and over again until the
  condition in parentheses is false.  So in the first example above,
  the code will keep doubling the <var>count</var> variable and adding
  one to the <var>times</var> variable until <var>count</var> is no
  longer less than ten million.  Then it will return <var>count</var>,
  which is how many times it had to double.
</p>

<p>
  Once you understand the first example, you should be able to figure
  out the second example on your own.
</p>

<p>
  There's another kind of loop called a <dfn>for</dfn> loop, which is
  very similar.  The first example, written as a for loop, looks like
  this: <kbd> code int times; int count; for(times = 0, count = 2;
  count &lt; 10000000; count = count * 2, times = times + 1) { }
  return times;</kbd> A for loop is a lot like a while loop, but the
  syntax is funny.  Note that after the word &quot;for&quot;, you have
  three different pieces of code in the parentheses, each separated by
  a semicolon.  The first piece of the code is done before the loop
  begins.  In this case, it sets <var>times</var> to 0 and
  <var>count</var> to 2.  The second piece of code, <code>count &lt;
  10000000</code> is checked every time through the loop.  In this
  case it's checking whether count is more than ten million, just like
  the while loop did.
</p>

<p>
  And the last section is done at the end of every time through the
  loop.  So the things that were inside the while loop have moved to
  the for loop's third section of code.  Putting code in the third
  section of the parentheses has the same effect as putting it in the
  loop body, so you can divide the code between the two however you
  like.

<h2> 2.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions </h2>


<p>
  The code command gives you constants like ST_VERSION.  It also gives
  you several other things, including a set of one-letter variables
  which it defines for you.
</p>

<p>
  A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a named piece of storage space.  A variable can
  hold a <dfn>value</dfn>, such as the integer 94 or the character string
  &quot;Bob's your uncle!&quot;.  The variable has a name that you use
  to refer to that storage.  The value of the variable may change over
  time.  For instance, you may add 2 to the variable, giving 96
  instead of 94.  But the variable name will not.
</p>

<p>
  For instance, type <kbd>code a = 94, a = a + 7, a</kbd>.  Make sure
  to type it as written, with the commas.  You should see a result
  like <samp>$7 = 101</samp>.  The commas are a special operator that
  means &quot;do the things in order, but only worry about the value
  of the <i>last</i> one&quot;.  So we did three things with that code
  statement.  We set the variable a to have the value 94.  Then we
  changed what a was equal to by setting it to its old value plus 7.
  Then, the very last part of the command, after the last comma, was
  a.  Since comma means &quot; only pay attention to the last one
  &quot;, the value returned was a's new value of 94 + 7, or 101.
</p>

<p>
  You can also separate statements with the semicolon.  Due to
  strangeness in the way the code command works, if you use the
  semicolon operator with the code command at all, you <em>must</em>
  finish your code with a semicolon or an end-curly-brace.  Otherwise
  you'll get very strange behavior indeed.  Try typing <kbd>code a =
  94; a = a + 7; return a;</kbd>.  You should get 101, the same result
  as above.  If you just get 94, you forgot the ending semicolon
  &mdash; try it again.  Note the 'return' statement at the end.  When
  you don't use a semicolon at the end of your code command, the
  Kernel Library assumes you're just writing a little expression and
  you want its value.  That's what you've been doing so far.  If you
  end your code command with a semicolon or an end-curly-brace,
  though, you'll need to include your own return statement if you want
  anything returned.  The return statement does roughly what the last
  statement after the comma did last paragraph.  Its value is what
  gets returned, and so that value is what gets assigned to a history
  variable like $9 or $26.
</p>

<p>
  Note that a variable in LPC isn't like a mathematical variable, and
  the equals sign above doesn't really mean equality in a mathematical
  sense.  Instead, the equals is often called <dfn>assignment</dfn> to
  indicate that it is setting the variable to have a value.  But
  unlike in mathematics, the variable can be repeatedly assigned,
  changing its value throughout your code.
</p>

<p>
  You've already seen the <dfn>+</dfn> operator.  There's also a
  minus, <dfn>-</dfn> which works the way you'd expect &mdash; it can
  be used to make a number or variable negative, or to subtract two
  numbers.  The asterisk <dfn>*</dfn> means multiplication, and the
  forward-slash, <dfn>/</dfn> represents division.  Remember that you
  can only add, multiply, subtract or divide integers with integers
  and decimal numbers (also called floating point) with other floating
  point numbers.  If you try to do otherwise, such as by typing
  <kbd>code 7 + 4.1</kbd>, you'll get an error.  Try it and see.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the operations are exact, but division of integers is not.
  If you divide, say, five by two, you'll find that DGD automatically
  rounds down to 2.  DGD will always round toward zero when you divide
  integers.  Test with the code command and see.
</p>

<p>
  Integers (and even floating point numbers) are limited in size.  If
  you try typing <kbd>code 10000 * 10000 * 10000</kbd>, you'll see a
  strange result &mdash; it's negative!  That's because integers have
  a maximum value of a little more than four billion, and if your
  numbers get larger than that, they'll wrap back around.  Unsigned
  number variables (we'll talk about them later) will wrap back to
  zero, while signed number variables will wrap to negative numbers.
  Similarly, if your integer variable gets smaller than the smallest
  allowed number, which may be large and negative, it will wrap back
  into being positive.  This wrapping is because DGD's basic numbers
  are of a fixed size, and there are only so many possible numbers
  that a single variable can represent.  If you need larger or smaller
  integers than that, you'll find that DGD's Arbitrary-Precision
  Signed Numbers (called ASNs) are the way to go.  They're explained
  in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>
  You can declare your own variables rather than using the ones that
  the code command gives you by default.  Integer (that means whole
  numbers, not decimals or fractions) variables are declared to be of
  type <dfn>int</dfn>.  So you might type <kbd>code int sam; sam = 7;
  sam = sam + 4; return sam;</kbd>.  Note that you must declare the
  variables at the very beginning.  If you try typing <kbd>code a = 4;
  int sam; sam = 7;</kbd>, you'll get an error.  Variables can only be
  declared at the beginning of a block scope.  What that means to you
  right now is that if you use variables in your code statements, put
  them right up front.
</p>

<p>
  Note for C users: in C, you could say <code>int sam = 7;</code> and
  it would work fine.  DGD doesn't allow you to declare and initialize
  a variable in that way, so don't.
</p>

<p>
  Not every value or variable is an integer, so not every variable is
  declared using int.  You can also have <dfn>unsigned</dfn>
  variables, which are integers that can't hold negative values.  You
  can declare an unsigned variable called <var>bruno</var> by typing
  <code>unsigned int bruno;</code>, or just <code>unsigned
  bruno;</code> Try subtracting a larger unsigned number from a
  smaller one and see what happens!  The wraparound can be hard to
  understand if you're not used to it.
</p>

<p>
  Remember that decimal numbers or fractional numbers are called
  floating point numbers.  A floating point variable called
  <var>temperature</var> would be declared as <code>float
  temperature;</code>.  Remember that you can only add, subtract,
  multiply and divide floating point numbers with other floating point
  numbers, not with integers.  That means that to double a floating
  point number, you'd need to multiply it by 2.0 rather than just 2.

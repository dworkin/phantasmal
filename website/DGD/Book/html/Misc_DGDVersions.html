<h2> 3.2 DGD Version Numbers </h2>


<p>
  DGD changes almost constantly, but the changes are usually small.
  The maintainer, Felix Croes (who uses the handle 'Dworkin'),
  fixes small problems and puts in code for new features all the time.
  However, it's important to know what versions of DGD are good,
  usable and stable since all these constant fixes can make the driver
  temporarily unstable.
</p>

<p>
  Dworkin addresses these problems by having <em>major</em> DGD versions,
  <em>stable</em> DGD versions, and <em>experimental</em> DGD versions.
  Major versions are numbered 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, et cetera.  The major version
  after 1.2 will then be either 1.3 or 2.0.  The major version after 3.4,
  if there eventually is a 3.4, will be either 3.5 or 4.0.  Major versions
  indicate several years of effort on Dworkin's part.  Between 1996 and
  2004, the major version went from 1.0 to 1.2.
</p>

<p>
  Stable versions come out much more frequently than major versions.
  Usually stable versions will be numbered by patch.  So, for
  instance, major version 1.2 gave rise to stable versions 1.2p1,
  1.2p2 and 1.2p3.  These are called version 1.2 patchlevel 1, version
  1.2 patchlevel 2, and version 1.2 patchlevel 3, respectively.  If
  you need to do ordinary DGD development, the most recent stable
  version or major version (whichever came out more recently) should
  be used.
</p>

<p>
  When Dworkin puts out those little updates every week or two (or
  occasionally more), he puts out experimental versions of DGD.
  Experimental versions are numbered as the major version, but with an
  extra number at the end.  So the experimental versions of 1.2 would
  be 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, et cetera, up to 1.2.71 and beyond.  Dworkin
  released over a hundred experimental 1.1 versions before version 1.2
  came out!
</p>

<p>
  Each stable version is usually the same as one specific experimental
  version.  So when a really stable, tested experimental version comes
  out, Dworkin will release it, slightly modified, as a stable
  version.  So, for instance, if Dworkin were on experimental version
  2.0.53 and the last stable version had been 2.0p2, then he might
  choose to rerelease 2.0.53 as 2.0p3 after light testing.  These are
  hypothetical examples, though those version numbers are likely to
  occur eventually.
</p>

<p>
  Experimental DGD versions will often have new features and slightly
  different interfaces.  For instance, DGD began allowing more
  incoming network connections in version 1.2.45.  This means that
  code written for experimental versions from 1.2.45 onward won't work
  on DGD 1.2.44 and before.  So new code written for experimental
  versions tends to be very tied to what DGD version you have.  Older
  code, though, tends to work just fine with newer DGD versions, with
  a few exceptions.  In general, it's easy to get them to work if
  you're a decent programmer and willing to do a little work.  The old
  interfaces rarely change and never change very dramatically.

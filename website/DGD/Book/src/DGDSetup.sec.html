@@SECTION Setup Setting Up DGD

<p>The first step in learning any new programming language is to
set up the tools. For most languages, that means the compiler or
interpreter and possibly a debugger. For DGD, that means setting up
the DGD driver, sometimes called the DGD server or DGD
interpreter.</p>

<p>You'll need to download the DGD driver from the internet unless
you have a copy on other media. Make sure to get a recent copy of
DGD, version 1.2 or later.</p>

@@SECTION Setup.Installing Installing DGD

<p>The DGD driver changes a lot from year to year, so any
instructions on installation may be out of date. These instructions
are valid as of early 2005 (DGD version 1.2.101), but if you have
any problems with them you should try a <a href=
"http://www.google.com">Google</a> search on "DGD", "compiling DGD"
or "installing DGD" to find out more about the latest instructions.
First, and more importantly, you should read any documentation that
comes with the package you downloaded about how to install it.</p>

<p>It's possible that you'll be able to find DGD in an
easily-installable form like RPM files or FreeBSD's ports tree or a
self-extracting archive with an InstallShield installer. The usual
choice, though, is to download a simple archive file (.zip for
Windows, .sit.hqx for Macintosh and .tar.gz for Unix) and install
it for yourself.</p>

<p>To install DGD, you'll need to compile it. This means you'll
need a compiler, such as GCC on Unix, CodeWarrior on the Macintosh
or Visual C++ on Windows.</p>

<p>I'll refer to the directory you installed DGD into as
<tt>dgd</tt> in this section. So if you installed DGD into
<tt>C:\PROGS\DGD</tt> then the path <tt>dgd/src</tt> would be the
same as <tt>C:\PROGS\DGD\src</tt>.</p>

<p>First, look in <tt>dgd/doc/Platforms</tt>. You'll see a chart
like this:</p>
<pre>
DARWIN          Darwin/OS X.  Also works for NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux.
LINUX           Older versions of Linux.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to
                src/host/Makefile.
SUNOS4          SunOS 4.x.
SOLARIS         SunOS 5.x.  In src/Makefile set LIBS to -lsocket -lnsl.  Older
                versions also require src/host/Makefile.sysv to be copied to
                src/host/Makefile.
DECALPHA        DEC Alpha.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
BEOS            BeOS.  In src/Makefile set LIBS to -lbe -ltracker, and copy
                src/host/Makefile.beos to src/host/Makefile.
WIN32           Windows NT or Windows 95.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/pc/README.
MACOS           Mac System 6 to 9.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/mac/README.
GENERIC_BSD     BSD Unix.
GENERIC_SYSV    SYSV Unix.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
</pre>

<p>You'll need to follow the instructions for your platform. For
instance, on Linux you'd want to copy
<tt>dgd/src/host/Makefile.sysv</tt> to
<tt>dgd/src/host/Makefile</tt>. For Macintosh or Windows you'd want
to read the appropriate README file and follow its instructions.
It'll tell you where to find a project file for DGD for your
compiler. Normally those files ship with DGD, so the README file
will just tell you the right subdirectory to look in.</p>

<p>If you have troubles compiling the server, you can ask the DGD
mailing list for help. Please try a few web searches first to see
if your problem is already known, and if it's in the DGD mailing
list archives. You'll always look better asking questions on the
list if you've obviously made an effort on your own behalf first.
It makes people more likely to help you. The DGD mailing list is a
very powerful tool, and has many of the most competent DGD users in
the world reading it regularly. Try to be respectful of it, so that
its readers will, in turn, respect <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>To find the DGD mailing list, try doing a Google search for "DGD
Mailing List". You should be able to find a page that will tell you
how to sign up for that list, and how to find the old archived
messages from the list.</p>

@@SECTION Setup.RunKernel Running the Kernel Library

<p>You'll need to run the Kernel Library to do most of the
exercises in this book. A copy comes with every copy of DGD. So if
you've already installed DGD, you've already installed the
Kernel.</p>

<p>Your copy of DGD came with a file called <tt>mud.dgd</tt>. Look
in DGD's directory and you should find it pretty quickly. You'll
need to edit that file before you can use it.</p>

<p>In <tt>mud.dgd</tt>, you'll see various lines assigning values
to various names. One line will say something like <code>directory
= "/home/dworkin/dgd/mud"</code>. You'll need to change that path
to the absolute path for the directory where you installed the
Kernel Library. That's the <tt>mud</tt> subdirectory of DGD. For
instance, if you installed DGD into <tt>~alan/dgd</tt> on your Unix
system, you'd change the filename in quotes to
<tt>/home/alan/dgd/mud</tt>. If your DGD directory wound up in
<tt>C:\Programs</tt> on your Windows machine, you'd change the line
to <code>directory = "C:\Programs\DGD\mud"</code>. The end of the
line, the part surrounded by stars and slashes, is a comment. You
can ignore it or remove it entirely (including all the stars and
slashes).</p>

<p>Note that the path has to be an <em>absolute</em> path. That
means you have to start it with a slash on Unix. You'd use a
backslash or a drive letter on Windows. But you <em>can't</em> just
start it with the name of the directory where you installed DGD and
leave out where on the drive that directory is, that won't work. No
relative paths. So <tt>/home/bob/dgd/mud</tt> and
<tt>C:\Programs\DGD\MUD</tt> are fine, but <tt>DGD\MUD</tt>
isn't.</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you'll need to run the DGD program. If
you're running on Windows and you compiled with Visual C++, you can
run dgd by double-clicking it and then choose the mud.dgd program
from the menu. If you compiled on Unix or used the Cygnus tools on
Windows, you'll need to run the program from the command line, with
the .dgd file as an argument. For instance, from Unix, in the DGD
directory, you might type <kbd>./bin/driver mud.dgd</kbd>. Note
that while Win32 permits you to run DGD from the command line, you
won't get proper error output if you do. So it's recommended you
run DGD and then choose a configuration file from the menu
instead.</p>

<p>If you've done it correctly then DGD will print messages about
what version you're running and various other things. Then nothing
visible will happen. If you're not used to running your own MUD
server, this can be a bit disconcerting. Don't worry, it's normal.
In fact, if DGD stops and goes back to the command line (usually
with an error message), <em>that</em> would be abnormal. The
messages DGD prints will look something like this:</p>
<pre>
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** DGD 1.2.73
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** Initializing...
Jan 29 16:09:53 ** Initialization complete.
</pre>

<p>Once you're running the server, you'll need to telnet to your
MUD. That requires a telnet client or MUD client. On Unix, the
simplest method is to run telnet from the command line. The syntax
is simply <kbd>telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</kbd>, where host
is the name or IP address of the host you're telnetting to, and
port is the port number. If you leave off the port number, telnet
will use port 23 by default, which is almost never what you want
for a MUD.</p>

<p>On Windows, you'll want to download a MUD client like zMUD or a
terminal program like TeraTerm or Putty. Do a web search on one of
those names, or just on 'Windows terminal program' or 'Win32 MUD
client' or similar.</p>

<p>Telnet back to your own machine, on the port where DGD is
running. Normally your machine's address will be 127.0.0.1 when you
telnet to it, which is called the <dfn>localhost</dfn> address. The
Kernel Library will usually start its telnet server on port 6047,
though you can check the file <tt>mud.dgd</tt> to be sure. You'll
want to telnet to the telnet port, not the binary port, from that
file. Your telnet program will attempt to connect to the wrong port
if you don't tell it the correct port number.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library will ask you for a login name. Tell it you
are <kbd>admin</kbd>. Then choose a password for this account. The
admin account is special, and gets a lot of privileges that other
accounts don't &mdash; you won't be able to do many of the
exercises in this book except with a privileged
account.</p>

@@SECTION Setup.KernelOverview An Overview of the Kernel Library

<p>To use the Kernel Library, you'll need a quick overview of what
you can do with it. This entire section applies only to the
unmodified Kernel Library -- any of this can be changed. But when
you start, this section describes how the interface works.</p>

<p>You can quit by typing <kbd>quit</kbd>, which is useful to know.
You can chat with others on the server by typing <kbd>say</kbd>, a
space, and what you want to say. This will send the message to
everyone else currently logged in. You can type <kbd>people</kbd>
to see who is currently logged in. All of these operations can be
performed by any user.</p>

<p>The admin user can also type <kbd>shutdown</kbd> to shut down
the server. He can also use the "code" command, which you'll learn
about in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library actually has a number of other commands, most
of them only for administrators, not players. Those will be covered
later as we need them.</p>

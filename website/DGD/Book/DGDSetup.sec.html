@@SECTION Setup Setting Up DGD

<p>
  The first step in learning any new programming language is to set up
  the tools.  For most languages, that means the compiler or
  interpreter and possibly a debugger.  In DGD, that means the server,
  also called the driver.
</p>

<p>
  You'll need to download the DGD driver from the internet unless you
  have a copy on other media.  Make sure to get a recent copy of DGD,
  version 1.2 or later.
</p>

@@SECTION Setup.Installing Installing DGD

<p>
  The DGD driver changes a lot from year to year, so any instructions
  on installation may be out of date.  These instructions are valid as
  of early 2004 (DGD version 1.2.73), but if you have any problems
  with them you should try a <a
  href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search on &quot;DGD&quot;,
  &quot;compiling DGD&quot; or &quot;installing DGD&quot; to find out
  more about the latest instructions.  First, and more importantly,
  you should read any documentation that comes with the package you
  downloaded about how to install it.
</p>

<p>
  It's possible that by the time you read this, you'll be able to get
  DGD in an easily-installable form like RPM files or a
  self-extracting archive with an InstallShield installer.  As I write
  it, though, the only choices are simple archive files (.zip for
  Windows, .sit.hqx for Macintosh and .tar.gz for Unix) and installing
  for yourself.  This book will document as though you were doing it
  that way.
</p>

<p>
  To install DGD, you'll need to compile it.  This means you'll need a
  compiler, such as GCC on Unix, CodeWarrior on the Macintosh or
  Visual C++ on Windows.
</p>

<p>
  I'll refer to the directory you installed DGD into as
  &quot;dgd&quot; in this section.  So if you installed DGD into
  &quot;C:\PROGS\DGD&quot; then the path &quot;dgd/src&quot; would be
  the same as &quot;C:\PROGS\DGD\src&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  First, look in dgd/doc/Platforms.  You'll see a chart like this:
</p>

<pre>
NETBSD          NetBSD.  This is the default.
BSD386          FreeBSD or 386BSD.
LINUX           Linux.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
SUNOS4          SunOS 4.x.
SOLARIS         SunOS 5.x.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile,
                and in src/Makefile also set LIBS to -lsocket -lnsl
DECALPHA        DEC Alpha.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
BEOS            BeOS.  Set LDFLAGS to -lbe -ltracker, and copy
                src/host/Makefile.beos to src/host/Makefile.
WIN32           Windows NT or Windows 95.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/pc/README.
MACOS           Mac System 6 to 9.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/mac/README.
GENERIC_BSD     BSD Unix.
GENERIC_SYSV    SYSV Unix.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
</pre>

<p>
  You'll need to follow the instructions for your platform.  For
  instance, on Linux you'd want to copy dgd/src/host/Makefile.sysv to
  dgd/src/host/Makefile.  For Macintosh or Windows you'd want to read the
  appropriate README file and follow its instructions.  Those files
  should be self-explanatory, and should tell you how to compile the
  server.
</p>

<p>
  If you have troubles compiling the server, you can ask the DGD
  mailing list for help.  Please try a few web searches first to see
  if your problem is already known, and if it's in the DGD mailing
  list archives.  You'll always look better asking questions on the
  list if you've obviously made an effort on your own behalf first.
  It makes people more likely to help you.
</p>


@@SECTION Setup.RunKernel Running the Kernel Library

<p>
  To do most of the exercises in this book, you'll need to be able to
  run the Kernel Library.  Luckily, a copy comes with every copy of
  DGD.  So if you've already installed DGD, you've already installed
  the Kernel.
</p>

<p>
  Your copy of DGD came with a file called &quot;mud.dgd&quot;.  Look
  in DGD's directory and you should find it pretty quickly.  You'll
  need to edit that file before you can use it.
</p>

<p>
  In that file, you'll see various lines assigning values to various
  words.  One of them will say something like <code>directory =
  &quot;/home/dworkin/dgd/mud&quot;</code>.  You'll need to change
  that path to the &quot;mud&quot; subdirectory of the absolute path
  of the directory where you installed DGD.  For instance, if you
  installed DGD into &quot;~alan/dgd&quot; on your Unix system, you'd
  change the filename in quotes to &quot;/home/alan/dgd/mud&quot;.  If
  you installed DGD into &quot;C:\Programs\DGD&quot; on your Windows
  machine, you'd change the line to <code>directory =
  &quot;C:\Programs\DGD\mud&quot;</code>.  The end of the line, the
  part surrounded by stars and slashes, is a comment.  You can ignore
  it.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the path has to be an <em>absolute</em> path.  That means
  you have to start it with a slash or a backslash or a tilde or a
  drive specifier, depending on your platform.  But you <em>can't</em>
  just start it with where you installed DGD, that won't work.  No
  relative paths.
</p>

<p>
  Once you've done that, you'll need to run the DGD program.  If
  you're running on Windows and you compiled with Visual C++, you can
  run it by itself and then choose the mud.dgd program from the menu.
  If you compiled on Unix or used the Cygnus tools on Windows, you'll
  need to run the program from the command line, with the .dgd file as
  an argument.  For instance, from Unix, in the DGD directory, you might
  type &quot;./bin/driver mud.dgd&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  If you've done it correctly, DGD will print messages about what
  version you're running and various other things, then it will sit
  and do nothing.  If you're not used to running your own MUD server,
  this can be a bit disconcerting.  Don't worry, it's normal.  In
  fact, if DGD stops and goes back to the command line (normally with
  an error message), <em>that</em> would be abnormal.  The messages
  you should expect will look something like this:
</p>

<pre>
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** DGD 1.2.73
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** Initializing...
Jan 29 16:09:53 ** Initialization complete.
</pre>

<p>
  Once you're running the server, you'll need to telnet to your MUD.
  That requires a telnet client of some kind.  On unix, that normally
  means running telnet from the command line.  The syntax is simply
  &quot;telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;&quot;, where host is the name
  or IP address of the host you're telnetting to, and port is the port
  number.  If you leave off the port number, telnet will use port 23
  by default, which is almost never what you want for a MUD.  On
  Windows, you'll want to download a MUD client like zMUD or a
  terminal program like TeraTerm or Putty.  Do a web search on any of
  those names, or just on 'Windows terminal program'.
</p>

<p>
  Telnet back to your own machine, on the port where DGD is running.
  Normally your machine's address will be 127.0.0.1 when you telnet to
  it, which is called the <em>localhost</em> address.  The Kernel
  Library will usually run on port #6047, though you can check the
  file mud.dgd to be sure.  You'll want to telnet to the telnet port,
  not the binary port, from that file.  Your telnet program will just
  connect to a telnet or SSH server if you don't tell it the correct
  port number.
</p>

<p>
  The Kernel Library will ask you for a login name.  Tell it you are
  &quot;admin&quot; (type it without the quotation marks).  Then
  choose a password for this account.  The admin account is special,
  and gets a lot of privileges that other accounts don't &mdash; you
  won't be able to do most of the exercises in this book except with a
  privileged account.  When you first set up the Kernel Library, the
  admin account is the only one.
</p>


@@SECTION Setup.KernelOverview An Overview of the Kernel Library

<p>
  To use the Kernel Library, you'll need a quick overview of what you
  can do with it.  This entire section applies only to the unmodified
  Kernel Library -- any of this can be changed.  But when you start, this
  section describes how the interface works.
</p>

<p>
  You can quit by typing &quot;quit&quot;, which is useful to know.
  You can chat with others on the server by typing &quot;say&quot;, a
  space, and what you want to say.  This will send the message to
  everyone else currently logged in.  You can type &quot;people&quot;
  to see who is currently logged in.  All of these operations can be
  performed by any user.
</p>

<p>
  The admin user can also type &quot;shutdown&quot; to shut down the
  server.  He can also use the &quot;code&quot; command, which you'll
  learn about in the next chapter.
</p>

<p>
  The Kernel Library actually has a number of other commands, most of
  them for admin.  But those will be covered later as we need them.

@@SECTION Setup Setting Up DGD

<p>
  The first step in learning any new programming language is to set up
  the tools.  For most languages, that means the compiler or
  interpreter and possibly a debugger.  In DGD, that means the server,
  also called the driver.
</p>

<p>
  You'll need to download the DGD driver from the internet unless you
  have a copy on other media.
</p>

@@SECTION Setup.Installing Installing DGD

<p>
  The DGD driver changes a lot from year to year, so any instructions
  on installation may be out of date.  These instructions are valid as
  of early 2004 (DGD version 1.2.73), but if you have any problems
  with them you should try a <a
  href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> search on &quot;DGD&quot;,
  &quot;compiling DGD&quot; or &quot;installing DGD&quot; to find out
  more about the latest instructions.  First, and more importantly,
  you should read any documentation that comes with the package you
  downloaded about how to install it.
</p>

<p>
  It's possible that by the time you read this, you'll be able to get
  DGD in an easily-installable form like RPM files or a
  self-extracting archive with an InstallShield installer.  As I write
  it, though, the only choices are simple archive files (.zip for
  Windows, .sit.hqx for Macintosh and .tar.gz for Unix) and installing
  for yourself.  This book will document as though you were doing it
  that way.
</p>

<p>
  To install DGD, you'll need to compile it.  This means you'll need a
  compiler, such as GCC on Unix, CodeWarrior on the Macintosh or
  Visual C++ on Windows.
</p>

<p>
  I'll refer to the directory you installed DGD into as
  &quot;dgd&quot; in this section.  So if you installed DGD into
  &quot;C:\PROGS\DGD&quot; then the path &quot;dgd/src&quot; would be
  the same as &quot;C:\PROGS\DGD\src&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  First, look in dgd/doc/Platforms.  You'll see a chart like this:
</p>

<pre>
NETBSD          NetBSD.  This is the default.
BSD386          FreeBSD or 386BSD.
LINUX           Linux.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
SUNOS4          SunOS 4.x.
SOLARIS         SunOS 5.x.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile,
                and in src/Makefile also set LIBS to -lsocket -lnsl
DECALPHA        DEC Alpha.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
BEOS            BeOS.  Set LDFLAGS to -lbe -ltracker, and copy
                src/host/Makefile.beos to src/host/Makefile.
WIN32           Windows NT or Windows 95.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/pc/README.
MACOS           Mac System 6 to 9.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/mac/README.
GENERIC_BSD     BSD Unix.
GENERIC_SYSV    SYSV Unix.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
</pre>

<p>
  You'll need to follow the instructions for your platform.  For
  instance, on Linux you'd want to copy dgd/src/host/Makefile.sysv to
  dgd/src/host/Makefile.  For Macintosh or Windows you'd want to read the
  appropriate README file and follow its instructions.  Those files
  should be self-explanatory, and should tell you how to compile the
  server.
</p>

<p>
  If you have troubles compiling the server, you can ask the DGD
  mailing list for help.  Please try a few web searches first to see
  if your problem is already known, and if it's in the DGD mailing
  list archives.  You'll always look better asking questions on the
  list if you've obviously made an effort on your own behalf first.
  It makes people more likely to help you.

@@SECTION Setup.DGDVersions How DGD Version Numbering Works

<p>
  DGD changes almost constantly, but the changes are usually small.
  The maintainer, Felix Croes (who uses the handle 'Dworkin'),
  fixes small problems and puts in code for new features all the time.
  However, it's important to know what versions of DGD are good,
  usable and stable since all these constant fixes can make the driver
  temporarily unstable.
</p>

<p>
  Dworkin addresses these problems by having <em>major</em> DGD versions,
  <em>stable</em> DGD versions, and <em>experimental</em> DGD versions.
  Major versions are numbered 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, et cetera.  The major version
  after 1.2 will then be either 1.3 or 2.0.  The major version after 3.4,
  if there eventually is a 3.4, will be either 3.5 or 4.0.  Major versions
  indicate several years of effort on Dworkin's part.  Between 1996 and
  2004, the major version went from 1.0 to 1.2.
</p>

<p>
  Stable versions come out much more frequently than major versions.
  Usually stable versions will be numbered by patch.  So, for
  instance, major version 1.2 gave rise to stable versions 1.2p1,
  1.2p2 and 1.2p3.  These are called version 1.2 patchlevel 1, version
  1.2 patchlevel 2, and version 1.2 patchlevel 3, respectively.  If
  you need to do ordinary DGD development, the most recent stable
  version or major version (whichever came out more recently) should
  be used.
</p>

<p>
  When Dworkin puts out those little updates every week or two (or
  occasionally more), he puts out experimental versions of DGD.
  Experimental versions are numbered as the major version, but with an
  extra number at the end.  So the experimental versions of 1.2 would
  be 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, et cetera, up to 1.2.71 and beyond.  Dworkin
  released over a hundred experimental 1.1 versions before version 1.2
  came out!
</p>

<p>
  Each stable version is usually the same as one specific experimental
  version.  So when a really stable, tested experimental version comes
  out, Dworkin will release it, slightly modified, as a stable
  version.  So, for instance, if Dworkin were on experimental version
  2.0.53 and the last stable version had been 2.0p2, then he might
  choose to rerelease 2.0.53 as 2.0p3 after light testing.  These are
  hypothetical examples, though those version numbers are likely to
  occur eventually.
</p>

<p>
  Experimental DGD versions will often have new features and slightly
  different interfaces.  For instance, DGD began allowing more
  incoming network connections in version 1.2.45.  This means that
  code written for experimental versions from 1.2.45 onward won't work
  on DGD 1.2.44 and before.  So new code written for experimental
  versions tends to be very tied to what DGD version you have.  Older
  code, though, tends to work just fine with newer DGD versions, with
  a few exceptions.  In general, it's easy to get them to work if
  you're a decent programmer and willing to do a little work.  The old
  interfaces rarely change and never change very dramatically.

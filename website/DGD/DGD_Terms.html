    <h1> Glossary of DGD Terms and Concepts </h1>

    <dl>
      <dt>Afuns</dt>
      <dd>An Afun, short for &quot;Auto Function&quot;, is defined in the
        Auto object and behaves like an Kfun.  It may override an existing
        Kfun. </dd>
      <dt>Applies</dt>
      <dd>Applies are functions in the MUDLib that the DGD driver calls.
        These are pretty much always in the Driver object, at least in DGD.
        They're not the same as Hooks because Hooks are called by other
        code in the MUDLib, not by the DGD driver binary itself.</dd>
      <dt>Atomic Functions</dt>
      <dd> Atomic functions are very, very uncommon even in LPMUDs.  DGD
        is really pretty much unique in having them.  An Atomic Function
        is one which, if it gets an error, basically never happened.
        Any variables, global data and whatnot that it played with will
        be back in the same state as if the function had never run.
        Atomic functions may not read or write network connections, nor
        read or write files.  Otherwise, they can do anything allowable
        in DGD LPC. </dd>
      <dt>Auto object</dt>
      <dd>The second LPC object created.  All later LPC objects, everything
        except the Auto object itself and the Driver object, inherit from
        Auto.  Auto is a common place to override the standard DGD Kfuns
        with versions tuned for your particular MUDLib. </dd>
      <dt>Clonable</dt>
      <dd> In MUDLibs that separate Inheritable and Clonable, a Program
        which may be cloned.  It may have variables and other state, its
        functions may be called and it may be recompiled in place.  In
        MUDLibs that don't separate the two, this distinction doesn't
        matter, but then a reboot may be necessary to upgrade objects.
        Compare Inheritable.</dd>
      <dt>Clone</dt>
      <dd> A clone is basically an &quot;instance&quot;, in an object
        oriented sense, of a master object.  Every clone shares its code
        (called a Program) with the master but each maintains an individual
        copy of the data.</dd>
      <dt>Driver object</dt>
      <dd>The first LPC object created.  It field a number of hooked called
        (see Hooks) from the actual DGD driver, the real C code.</dd>
      <dt>Driver program</dt>
      <dd>The actual binary program in C, not LPC, that starts up the whole
        LPC environment and begins running the interpreted parts.  It may
        be extended with a variety of packages and extensions, or be normal
        &quot;vanilla&quot; DGD.  The driver implements common functions
        that programs can't do for themselves and that any big program
        is likely to need.  See also MUDLib. </dd>
      <dt>Efuns</dt>
      <dd>Short for External Functions.  Efuns are functions which are
        defined or overridden by the MUDLib's auto object.  Basically,
        just like AFuns.</dd>
      <dt>Execution Rounds</dt>
      <dd>
        Execution rounds are what used to be called DGD Threads.  An
        execution round occurs in response to an event.  Any event
        will be responded to by some piece of LPC code somewhere in
        your MUD.  One run of that code is called an execution round.
        Whenever an ER ends a bunch of stuff happens.  For instance,
        objects are swapped to disk, and send_message and
        send_datagram actually send.  Shutdowns, reboots and state
        dumps wait for the current ER to end before they occur...  So
        don't do your post-dump or post-shutdown stuff right after
        your shutdown call.  Wait until the current ER has ended so
        you're sure shutdown has already been called.
      </dd>
      <dt>Hooks</dt>
      <dd>Functions which get called when certain things happen.  They're
        like event handlers in some languages except that, as with Java
        interfaces, you don't get to pick their names, you just supply an
        Object with all the right function names defined.  You register
        with another part of the MUDLib for a Hook -- if the driver just
        does it automatically, it's an Apply instead of a Hook.</dd>
      <dt>Inheritable</dt>
      <dd>In MUDLibs that separate Inheritable and Clonable, a Program
        from which other programs may inherit.  It may not be cloned,
        none of its functions can be directly called and it may have no
        variables nor any other kind of state.  If it needs to be dynamically
        upgraded, it will be destroyed rather than recompiled in place,
        and it will be regenerated on demand from the new source.  This
        is restrictive, but without it you may need to reboot the server
        to upgrade objects.  Compare Clonable.</dd>
      <dt>Issue</dt>
      <dd>If you stumble into the thorny territory of writing your own object
        manager, as you'll need to do in order to upgrade (recompile) objects
        without rebooting for a Persistent MUD, you'll probably need to know
        about Issues.  An Issue of an object, in particular of an Inheritable
        object, is a compiled version of that object.  Until every object
        inheriting from a given Issue has been destructed or recompiled, the
        Issue is still there, lurking.  An object manager can be careful to
        destroy any old Issues when it recompiles a new one, but that's a
        nontrivial undertaking.  It is easiest to keep track of issues by
        their object index, which will be different for each issue.
        See the example object manager code on the
        main page and the mailing list archives.</dd>
      <dt>Kfuns</dt>
      <dd>Kfuns are DGD Kernel Functions, not to be confused with the Kernel
        MUDLib, a different beast.  These are the basic things that DGD lets
        your MUDLib do.  The MUDLib may override them so that the actual
        objects your wizards create use Kfuns different from the ones
        DGD supplies.  See Auto object.</dd>
      <dt>LFuns</dt>
      <dd>Lfuns are local functions, functions local to a given object or
        program.</dd>
      <dt>Lightweight Object</dt>
      <dd> DGD is a disk-based MUD, and swaps out its objects regularly
        (indeed, constantly) to a swap file.  Little things like member
        variables (including arrays and mappings), get swapped as part of
        the object they're part of.  If they're referenced by another
        object, then instead of being shared they'll be copied into the
        other object as well when the current Thead (qv) of execution
        completes.  LWOs have .c files that define them, but act otherwise
        just like arrays and mappings -- they're part of the object that
        references them, swap with it and are copied if multiple objects
        reference them. </dd>
      <dt>LWO</dt>
      <dd> A Lightweight Object. </dd>
      <dt>Master</dt>
      <dd>A clone is produced from a master object using the clone_object
        kfun.  In some MUDLibs, the master must be a Clonable and may not
        be an Inheritable.</dd>
      <dt>MUDLib</dt>
      <dd>A MUDLib is the layer of LPC on top of the Driver program that
        runs the actual game or application you want.  The MUDLib implements
        stuff you know your wizards or other users will want to do that
        not every program built on DGD will necessarily want.  This includes
        things like rooms, mobiles and objects.  Remember, not only do
        different MUDs implement these things in different ways, but DGD
        can be used for pretty much any kind of network server, not just
        MUDs.</dd>
      <dt>Object</dt>
      <dd>A chunk of code which may inherit from other objects.  It tracks
        its own data.  The same thing as a Program.</dd>
      <dt>Object manager</dt>
      <dd>To have a Persistent MUD, you'll need to keep track of what
        inherits and clones what so that you can recompile or destroy all
        the right stuff at all the right times.  There's a massive amount
        of deep, confusing mailing list traffic on this deep, confusing
        topic.  To cut to the chase, you can try installing Geir Harald
        Hansen's Object Manager from the top page's LPC Code Examples. </dd>
      <dt>Persistent MUD</dt>
      <dd>A Persistent MUD is one that never does the usual save, recompile,
        reboot routine.  Instead it keeps its memory state around and
        recompiles stuff in-place.  This is very, very hard to do in most
        languages and impossible in pretty much every other MUD server.
        That's why DGD is so proud of being able to do it well.  To do this
        properly, you'll need a MUDLib that separates Inheritable and
        Clonable objects -- nothing that's both inherited from and cloned.
        See Inheritable, Clonable, and Object Manager. </dd>
      <dt>Program</dt>
      <dd>The LPC code of an object.  In many MUDLibs,
        it must be either an Inheritable or a Clonable but may not be
        both.</dd>
      <dt>Thread</dt>
      <dd>
        A thread of execution -- if multiple Threads are occurring,
        that means multiple things are happening more-or-less at the
        same time, and maybe <i>really</i> at the same time if you've
        got multiple processors running DGD.  This is also the old,
        confusing, now-obsolete term for an Execution Round (qv).
        Note that DGD code always acts exactly as though it's
        single-threaded, even when it's actually running
        multithreaded.  How it does this is Deep Voodoo, and should be
        questioned only by those with a profound understanding of
        Atomic Functions (qv).
      </dd>
      <dt> Tick </dt>
      <dd> A tick is a hardware-independent abstraction of CPU usage.
        DGD runs on multiple platforms, and you'd like them to have
        similar behavior with respect to things like CPU quotas.  So
        DGD rates various operations by how processor-intensive they are,
        and marks off ticks accordingly.  Tick usage can be limited by
        the rlimits() construct, and monitored by status().  The Kernel
        Library has a quota system for ticks that prevents you using
        too many at a time, or too many total.

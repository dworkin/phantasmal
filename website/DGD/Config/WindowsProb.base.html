This is an annoying problem on Windows and MacOS.  I've looked into
verifying that pathnames have proper capitalization, but that would be
costly and still would prevent the simultaneous (distinct) existance
of /usr/System and /usr/system, which is perfectly allowable under unix.
Right now, I do not have a good solution.

I will change the errormessage so that there will be more of a hint as to
what is wrong.

Try starting the driver directly, without configuration file.  Then
select a configuration file from the File menu and run it.  Started in
this manner, DGD will not exit when encountering a fatal error, but will
continue to display the error until the user selects exit from the File
menu.

Generally, you will not be able to type in your static ip and get your
box from home when you are dealing with cable or dsl.  You should be
able to type in the private ip of your box though and actually get the
right thing.  You may also have to deal with firewall settings on your
modem if you are on cable/dsl.

just use localhost from your box.  if you want others to log in you
will have to have them use the ip of your modem.

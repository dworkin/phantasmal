This is an annoying problem on Windows and MacOS.  I've looked into
verifying that pathnames have proper capitalization, but that would be
costly and still would prevent the simultaneous (distinct) existance
of /usr/System and /usr/system, which is perfectly allowable under unix.
Right now, I do not have a good solution.

I will change the errormessage so that there will be more of a hint as to
what is wrong.

Try starting the driver directly, without configuration file.  Then
select a configuration file from the File menu and run it.  Started in
this manner, DGD will not exit when encountering a fatal error, but will
continue to display the error until the user selects exit from the File
menu.

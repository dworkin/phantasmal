AFAIK, there is no binary port with the networking patches.  Instead, only
the primary telnet port is opened by default and all other ports must
be opened with the open_port() kfun that the networking patches add.

Subject: [DGD] sizeof(static string *buffer)
Date: Sat, 11 Sep 2004 00:13:49 -0400

Hi All,

I'm trying to get the network patch going on DGD 1.2p4 on SuSE 9.1.

The daemon compiles just fine, but I get a runtime error (that you can
see below) for the kfun sizeof(),  Now, I thought that a static string
array counted as an array just as much as mixed* did.  This is
apparently wrong.  Can someone confirm this?  And if so, how can I get
the size of a static string*?

Please see pertinent things below, and thanks for any help or advice you
could offer.

John Ruiz

i'm a relative DGD newbie (fairly expert at LPC however), but it
appears as though buffer is not initialized for some reason, which
would cause legacy LPC sizeof() to error based on the fact it is 0
(LPC's way of noting null).  I believe in DGD it works the same way. 
So, you may want to replace

if(sizeof(buffer))

with

if(buffer && sizeof(buffer))

or determine why buffer is not being initialized.

Hope that helps.

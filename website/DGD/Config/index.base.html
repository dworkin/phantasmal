<h4>If You're New To DGD</h4>

<p>If you're just getting into DGD, you'll want to know some
things. First, you'll need a MUDLib to go with your DGD server. If
you don't know what that is, you should definitely read the
<a href="http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud-faq.htm">LPMUD Frequently
Asked Questions</a> . And if you don't know what a MUDLib is, you
should probably make sure you have plenty of other MUD or
programming experience. DGD is an incredible driver with a lot of
good features, but it currently has no good MUDLib for a complete
beginner to use. It takes a lot of programming to make any good
MUD, and DGD starts you off with lots of potential but not much
actual game in place.</p>

<h2>DGD Stuff, and How to Get It:</h2>

<h3>The DGD server:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Check the <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/">Dworkin.nl
  FTP Site</a> for the most up-to-date DGD stuff.</li>

  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/dgd-1.2.tar.gz">DGD 1.2
  source</a> from Dworkin's site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Add-ons and Packages</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/pkg/">Packages for DGD
  1.2 (not many)</a></li>

  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/pkg/1.1/">Packages for
  DGD 1.1</a></li>

  <li>Lee Salzman's <a href=
  "http://www.lvdi.net/~lee.salzman/dgd-mod.tar.gz">DGD package</a>
  adds foreach() and lambda functions. Here's <a href=
  "http://www.lvdi.net/~lee.salzman/dgd-mod.diff.gz">the diff</a>
  you can use to get the same result. <b>(old)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Don't bother with the add-ons unless you know you specifically
need one or another. Don't bother with them at all if you're just
getting started. What you mostly want is the DGD server itself.
Consult your MUDLib documentation to determine what version of DGD
you're likely to need. If you're writing a new MUDLib from scratch,
get the most recent experimental version of DGD. They're all pretty
stable and Dworkin adds new features constantly.</p>

<h4>If You're New To DGD</h4>

<p>If you're just getting into DGD, you'll want to know some things.
First, you'll need a MUDLib to go with your DGD server. If you don't
know what that is, you should definitely read the <a href=
"http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud-faq.htm">LPMUD Frequently Asked
Questions</a> . And if you don't know what a MUDLib is, you should
probably make sure you have plenty of other MUD or programming
experience. DGD is an incredible driver with a lot of good features, but
it currently has no good MUDLib for a complete beginner to use. It takes
a lot of programming to make any good MUD, and DGD starts you off with
lots of potential but not much actual game in place.</p>

<h2>DGD Stuff, and How to Get It:</h2>

<h3>The DGD server:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Check the <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/">Dworkin.nl FTP
  Site</a> for the most up-to-date DGD stuff.</li>

  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/dgd-1.2.tar.gz">DGD 1.2
  source</a> from Dworkin's site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Add-ons and Packages</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/pkg/">Packages for DGD 1.2
  (not many)</a></li>

  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/pkg/1.1/">Packages for DGD
  1.1</a></li>

  <li>Lee Salzman's <a href=
  "http://www.lvdi.net/~lee.salzman/dgd-mod.tar.gz">DGD package</a> adds
  foreach() and lambda functions. Here's <a href=
  "http://www.lvdi.net/~lee.salzman/dgd-mod.diff.gz">the diff</a> you
  can use to get the same result. <b>(old)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Don't bother with the add-ons unless you know you specifically need
one or another. Don't bother with them at all if you're just getting
started. What you mostly want is the DGD server itself. Consult your
MUDLib documentation to determine what version of DGD you're likely to
need. If you're writing a new MUDLib from scratch, get the most recent
experimental version of DGD. They're all pretty stable and Dworkin adds
new features constantly.</p>

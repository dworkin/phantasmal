    <p>
      If you're just getting into DGD, you'll want to know some
      things.  First, you'll need a MUDLib to go with your DGD server.
      If you don't know what that is, you should definitely read the
      <a href="http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud-faq.htm"> LPMUD
      Frequently Asked Questions </a>.  And if you don't know what a
      MUDLib is, you should probably make sure you have plenty of
      other MUD experience or lots of documentation.  DGD is an
      incredible driver with a lot of good features, but it currently
      has no good MUDLib for a beginner to use.  You're going to be
      doing a lot of programming before this is all over.

    <h2> DGD Stuff, and How to Get It: </h2>

    <h3> The DGD server: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Check the <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/">Dworkin.nl FTP
	  Site</a> for the most up-to-date DGD stuff.
      </li>
      <li> <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/dgd-1.2.tar.gz">
	  DGD 1.2 source </a> from Dworkin's site. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Add-ons and Packages </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/pkg/">
	  Packages for DGD 1.2 (not many) </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/pkg/1.1/">
	  Packages for DGD 1.1 </a> </li>
      <li> Lee Salzman's
	<a href="http://www.lvdi.net/~lee.salzman/dgd-mod.tar.gz">
	  DGD package</a> adds foreach() and lambda functions.  Here's
	<a href="http://www.lvdi.net/~lee.salzman/dgd-mod.diff.gz">
	  the diff</a> you can use to get the same result. <b>(old)</b></li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    Don't bother with the add-ons unless you know you specifically
    need one or another.  What you mostly want is the DGD server
    itself.  Consult your MUDLib documentation to determine what
    version of DGD you're likely to need.  If you're writing a new
    MUDLib from scratch, get the most recent experimental version of
    DGD.  They're all pretty stable and Dworkin adds new features
    often.

  <h2> DGD-Compatible MUDLibs </h2>

  <p> (Have you already read the <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq">
      DGD FAQ </a> section on
    <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/faq4.html"> MUDLibs? </a>
    You should.)
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">Phantasmal</a> is
      built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and shows off cool DGD features
      like compile-in-place, object tracking and LWOs.  It works only
      with recent experimental versions of DGD. </li>

    <li> <a href="external/melville_0.9.1.tar.gz">
	Melville 0.9.1, a minimal but quite usable MUDLib</a> tested with
      DGD 1.1.  It includes a sould, channeld and mud mail.</li>

    <li> <a href="http://gurba.sytes.net/~erlends/gurba.html">
	GurbaLib's</a> page is still up, but the library is no
      longer under development.  GurbaLib has the most features of
      any current MUDLib.  It has rooms, creatures, guilds, and
      basically all the expected high-fantasy MUD trappings.
      Download it instead of 2.4.5 :-) It runs on a nonstandard,
      modified DGD 1.1 base.  You can download version 0.40 <a
	href="external/gurba.tgz"> here </a>.
    </li>

    <li> The Kernel MUDLib is extremely well-written and secure, but
      also very, very minimal.  It's distributed with any recent
      version of <a href="#DGDPackages"> DGD </a>
    </li>

    <li> The <a href="external/reload[1][1].0.1.tar.gz">Reload MUDLib</a>
      is a restructuring of the Kernel Library to use a different directory
      structure.  Better?  Worse?  You be the judge.
    </li>

    <li> The LPC 2.4.5 MUDLib has been adapted for use with DGD 1.1.
      It's sloppy, it's outdated, it's unsupported -- but it
      <b>does</b> give you a game from the get-go.  You can download
      it <a href="external/2.4.5-for-1.1.tgz">here</a>.
    </li>

    <li> <a href="http://tihlde.org/~franks/downloads/dgd/">
	MudOS alike for DGD (MudOSa4DGD)</a> isn't really a MUDLib but
      it's meant to be a good basis for one or for adapting MudOS
      MUDLibs to DGD.
    </li>

    <li> I think this is an old version of the Xyllomer MUDLib, but
      in any case,
      <a href="ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/unix/games/lpmud/pblib/Mudlib-PB.05.tar.gz">
	PBLib</a> is <i>way</i> out of date.  There's a
      <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/PB.diff.gz">patch</a>
      that may bring it sufficiently up to date.  Then again, it may
      not.</li>
    <li> John &quot;West&quot; McKenna's
      <a href="http://www.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/~john/dgd/">
	Inferno MUDLib </a> was never really released.  It's mostly
      without documentation, and is based on an (also-unreleased) chat
      server called Flame.  However, one more example MUDLib is never
      a bad thing. </li>
    <li> The <a href="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/lpmoo/">LPMOO
        MUDLib</a> is a nifty idea -- MOO implemented on top of
      DGD.  The current version is extremely out-of-date.  There's a
      patch to update it to DGD 1.1, which is at least closer to
      modern.  You can download version 1.2
      <a href="external/lpmoo-1.2.tar.gz">here</a> </li>

        MUDlib hasn't put anything I can understand (i.e. anything in English)
	on their SourceForge page, but they seem to be a DGD MUDLib,
	probably still in the planning stages.  The text seems to be in,
	like, Danish or Swedish or something.  Sorry, I'm one of these
	Americans who speaks nothing but English and a little Spanish, so
	I can't tell anything useful except that it's DGD-based and
	written from scratch. </li>

        MUDLib doesn't seem to have gotten very far, and the discussion
        is in Swedish, but it's nice to see other people playing with
        DGD.  They may be related to the Swedish MUD in the
	<a href="MUDs_using_DGD.html">MUD list</a>. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> As of this moment, none of the &quot;Still in Early Development&quot;
      MUDs have made much anything public.  But hey, these links will be
      around for awhile so they may have more information available
      when you click on them. </p>

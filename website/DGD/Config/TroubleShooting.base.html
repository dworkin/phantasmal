Nevertheless, given that you can connect to the MUD yourself, this is
some firewall or routing problem.

Subject: [DGD] IPv6

I've tested IPv6 on MacOS X, the *BSD family, Linux and Solaris.  It
is turned on by default.  To compile without it, add -DINET6=0 to
CCFLAGS in dgd/src/Makefile.

IPv6 support for Windows will follow later -- I don't currently have
a suitable Windows machine on which to compile and test it.

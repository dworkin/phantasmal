<h2>DGD-Compatible MUDLibs</h2>

<p>(Have you already read the <a href=
"http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq">DGD FAQ</a> section on <a href=
"http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/faq4.html">MUDLibs?</a> You
should.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">Phantasmal</a> is
  built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and shows off cool DGD
  features like compile-in-place, object tracking and LWOs. It
  works only with recent experimental versions of DGD.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.google.com">Melville 0.9.1, a minimal but
  quite usable MUDLib</a> tested with DGD 1.1. It includes a sould,
  channeld and mud mail.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://gurba.sytes.net/~erlends/gurba.html">GurbaLib's</a> page
  is still up, but the library is no longer under development.
  GurbaLib has the most features of any current MUDLib. It has
  rooms, creatures, guilds, and basically all the expected
  high-fantasy MUD trappings. Download it instead of 2.4.5 :-) It
  runs on a nonstandard, modified DGD 1.1 base. You can download
  version 0.40 <a href="http://www.google.com">here</a> .</li>

  <li>The Kernel MUDLib is extremely well-written and secure, but
  also very, very minimal. It's distributed with any recent version
  of <a href="#DGDPackages">DGD</a></li>

  <li>The <a href="http://www.google.com">Reload MUDLib</a> is a
  restructuring of the Kernel Library to use a different directory
  structure. Better? Worse? You be the judge.</li>

  <li>The LPC 2.4.5 MUDLib has been adapted for use with DGD 1.1.
  It's sloppy, it's outdated, it's unsupported -- but it
  <b>does</b> give you a game from the get-go. You can download it
  <a href="http://www.google.com">here</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="http://tihlde.org/~franks/downloads/dgd/">MudOS
  alike for DGD (MudOSa4DGD)</a> isn't really a MUDLib but it's
  meant to be a good basis for one or for adapting MudOS MUDLibs to
  DGD.</li>

  <li>I think this is an old version of the Xyllomer MUDLib, but in
  any case, <a href=
  "ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/unix/games/lpmud/pblib/Mudlib-PB.05.tar.gz">
  PBLib</a> is <i>way</i> out of date. There's a <a href=
  "http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/PB.diff.gz">patch</a> that may bring
  it sufficiently up to date. Then again, it may not.</li>

  <li>John "West" McKenna's <a href=
  "http://www.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/~john/dgd/">Inferno MUDLib</a> was
  never really released. It's mostly without documentation, and is
  based on an (also-unreleased) chat server called Flame. However,
  one more example MUDLib is never a bad thing.</li>

  <li>The <a href="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/lpmoo/">LPMOO
  MUDLib</a> is a nifty idea -- MOO implemented on top of DGD. The
  current version is extremely out-of-date. There's a patch to
  update it to DGD 1.1, which is at least closer to modern. You can
  download version 1.2 <a href=
  "http://www.google.com">here</a></li>

  MUDlib hasn't put anything I can understand (i.e. anything in
  English) on their SourceForge page, but they seem to be a DGD
  MUDLib, probably still in the planning stages. The text seems to
  be in, like, Danish or Swedish or something. Sorry, I'm one of
  these Americans who speaks nothing but English and a little
  Spanish, so I can't tell anything useful except that it's
  DGD-based and written from scratch.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://herator.lysator.liu.se/index_en.html">Herator</a> MUDLib
  doesn't seem to have gotten very far, and the discussion is in
  Swedish, but it's nice to see other people playing with DGD. They
  may be related to the Swedish MUD in the <a href=
  "MUDs_using_DGD.html">MUD list</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As of this moment, none of the "Still in Early Development" MUDs
have made much anything public. But hey, these links will be around
for awhile so they may have more information available when you
click on them.</p>

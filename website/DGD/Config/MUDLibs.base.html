  <h2> DGD-Compatible MUDLibs </h2>

  <p> (Have you already read the <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq">
      DGD FAQ </a> section on
    <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/faq4.html"> MUDLibs? </a>
    You should.)
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">Phantasmal</a> is
      built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and shows off cool DGD features
      like compile-in-place, object tracking and LWOs.  It works only
      with recent experimental versions of DGD. </li>

    <li> <a href="../external/melville_0.9.1.tar.gz">
	Melville 0.9.1, a minimal but quite usable MUDLib</a> tested with
      DGD 1.1.  It includes a sould, channeld and mud mail.</li>

    <li> <a href="http://gurba.sytes.net/~erlends/gurba.html">
	GurbaLib's</a> page is still up, but the library is no
      longer under development.  GurbaLib has the most features of
      any current MUDLib.  It has rooms, creatures, guilds, and
      basically all the expected high-fantasy MUD trappings.
      Download it instead of 2.4.5 :-) It runs on a nonstandard,
      modified DGD 1.1 base.  You can download version 0.40 <a
	href="../external/gurba.tgz"> here </a>.
    </li>

    <li> The Kernel MUDLib is extremely well-written and secure, but
      also very, very minimal.  It's distributed with any recent
      version of <a href="#DGDPackages">DGD</a>
    </li>

    <li> The <a href="../external/reload[1][1].0.1.tar.gz">Reload MUDLib</a>
      is a restructuring of the Kernel Library to use a different directory
      structure.  Better?  Worse?  You be the judge.
    </li>

    <li> The LPC 2.4.5 MUDLib has been adapted for use with DGD 1.1.
      It's sloppy, it's outdated, it's unsupported -- but it
      <b>does</b> give you a game from the get-go.  You can download
      it <a href="../external/2.4.5-for-1.1.tgz">here</a>.
    </li>

    <li> <a href="http://tihlde.org/~franks/downloads/dgd/">
	MudOS alike for DGD (MudOSa4DGD)</a> isn't really a MUDLib but
      it's meant to be a good basis for one or for adapting MudOS
      MUDLibs to DGD.
    </li>

    <li> I think this is an old version of the Xyllomer MUDLib, but
      in any case,
      <a href="ftp://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/unix/games/lpmud/pblib/Mudlib-PB.05.tar.gz">
	PBLib</a> is <i>way</i> out of date.  There's a
      <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/PB.diff.gz">patch</a>
      that may bring it sufficiently up to date.  Then again, it may
      not.</li>
    <li> John &quot;West&quot; McKenna's
      <a href="http://www.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/~john/dgd/">
	Inferno MUDLib </a> was never really released.  It's mostly
      without documentation, and is based on an (also-unreleased) chat
      server called Flame.  However, one more example MUDLib is never
      a bad thing. </li>
    <li> The <a href="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/lpmoo/">LPMOO
        MUDLib</a> is a nifty idea -- MOO implemented on top of
      DGD.  The current version is extremely out-of-date.  There's a
      patch to update it to DGD 1.1, which is at least closer to
      modern.  You can download version 1.2
      <a href="../external/lpmoo-1.2.tar.gz">here</a> </li>
  </ul>

        MUDlib hasn't put anything I can understand (i.e. anything in English)
	on their SourceForge page, but they seem to be a DGD MUDLib,
	probably still in the planning stages.  The text seems to be in,
	like, Danish or Swedish or something.  Sorry, I'm one of these
	Americans who speaks nothing but English and a little Spanish, so
	I can't tell anything useful except that it's DGD-based and
	written from scratch. </li>

        MUDLib doesn't seem to have gotten very far, and the discussion
        is in Swedish, but it's nice to see other people playing with
        DGD.  They may be related to the Swedish MUD in the
	<a href="MUDs_using_DGD.html">MUD list</a>. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> As of this moment, none of the &quot;Still in Early Development&quot;
      MUDs have made much anything public.  But hey, these links will be
      around for awhile so they may have more information available
      when you click on them. </p>

  <h2> Problems with IPv6 on DGD </h2>

Subject: [DGD] IPv6

I've tested IPv6 on MacOS X, the *BSD family, Linux and Solaris.  It
is turned on by default.  To compile without it, add -DINET6=0 to
CCFLAGS in dgd/src/Makefile.

IPv6 support for Windows will follow later -- I don't currently have
a suitable Windows machine on which to compile and test it.

Dworkin

  I'm sure this has been answered before.

  I'm trying to get DGD running on a new machine.  I tried grabbing
both 1.2.90 and 1.2.93 with the same results.  I've compiled with the
host set to LINUX and to DARWIN.  The machine is actually running
Fedora Core 1, which is based strongly on RedHat Linux, and distributed
by RedHat.

  Every time I run DGD (at least if the config file is right, *grin*),
I get the error message:  "socket IPv6: Address family not supported by
protocol".

  I haven't figured out where this message is coming from yet, so I'm
not sure where in the code to play with.  Any hints?

  Note that I'm not running Phantasmal, just the Kernel Library.

  It appears that DGD dislikes something about the way Fedora does
IPv6, and it looks like there's no IPv6->IPv4 failover in
dgd/src/host/unix/connect.c - if IPv6 is present but fails, DGD simply
doesn't start up.

  I've undefined INET6 and AF_INET6 at the top of the file as a
temporary hack to get it working.  Note to Dworkin:  minor typo in the
comment line where you do the AF_INET6 defines at the top of
dgd/src/host/unix/connect.c -- you wrote AT_INET6 where you meant
AF_INET6 once.

  Looks like my hack works, so I'll go back to ignoring the existence
of IPv6 for a bit :-)

It looks like the include files define AF_INET6, but the kernel doesn't
support it.  In the main Makefile, add INET6=0 to the options, make clean
and rebuild.

  Did this.  It seems to work fine.  I added "-DINET6=0" to the DEFINES
variable, which I assume is what you meant below.

You only need to load the ipv6 module, modprobe ipv6 and that's all =)
I have the same problem with Slackware 10, and i fixed loading that
module =)

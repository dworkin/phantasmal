Subject: [DGD] newbie question. :(

Generally, you will not be able to type in your static ip and get your
box from home when you are dealing with cable or dsl.  You should be
able to type in the private ip of your box though and actually get the
right thing.  You may also have to deal with firewall settings on your
modem if you are on cable/dsl.

just use localhost from your box.  if you want others to log in you
will have to have them use the ip of your modem.

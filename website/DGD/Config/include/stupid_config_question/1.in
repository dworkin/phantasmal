Subject: [DGD] Stupid config question...

  I'm sure this has been answered before.

  I'm trying to get DGD running on a new machine.  I tried grabbing
both 1.2.90 and 1.2.93 with the same results.  I've compiled with the
host set to LINUX and to DARWIN.  The machine is actually running
Fedora Core 1, which is based strongly on RedHat Linux, and distributed
by RedHat.

  Every time I run DGD (at least if the config file is right, *grin*),
I get the error message:  "socket IPv6: Address family not supported by
protocol".

  I haven't figured out where this message is coming from yet, so I'm
not sure where in the code to play with.  Any hints?

  Note that I'm not running Phantasmal, just the Kernel Library.

(About Tools, from a message by Par Winzell:)

As you seem to have already figured out, there's two substantially 
different ways to compile DGD for Windows; one's native to Windows, uses 
the Windows API, and requires Visual C++... and one compiles DGD as a 
Unix application, on top of Cygwin. Presuming you can't find somebody to 
compile DGD+ANSI for you using Visual C++ (I loathe the Microsoft IDE's 
and try hard to keep them away from my computer), by far your best bet 
is to use Cygwin. So...

... first of all, DGD compiles cleanly under Cygwin and runs without 
trouble. It does need to use the 'SYSV' Makefile in dgd/src/host rather 
than the 'BSD' one. I understand you were frustated with Cygwin by the 
time you quit, but I suggest you persist. If things continue to go 
wrong, please let us know what 'missing files' actually means. 
Meanwhile, these commands should fully compile DGD under Cygwin, if you 
have a sufficient installation:

   *  wget --passive-ftp ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/dgd-1.2p4.tar.gz
   *  tar -xzvf dgd-1.2p4.tar.gz
   *  cd dgd/src
   *  cp -p host/Makefile.sysv host/Makefile
   *  make install

If all goes well, you will have a binary in dgd/bin/driver. The Cygwin 
version, not being a native Windows application, is also not a GUI one; 
you'd do

   * cd ..
   * bin/driver mud.dgd

after modifying mud.dgd with the correct absolute path(s).

Finally, please don't worry overly much about installing Cygwin on your 
machine. It's not going to do any harm and I don't think it gets into 
the guts of your installation. You don't even really need to uninstall 
it if you get tired of it; delete i.e. C:\Cygwin and remove the links 
from the start menu, and I believe it's pretty much gone. You might even 
find that you get used to having it around. As tools go for making 
Windows sane, it's unparallelled in competence.

And please dump Wordpad!! :)

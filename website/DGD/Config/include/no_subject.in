This is an annoying problem on Windows and MacOS.  I've looked into
verifying that pathnames have proper capitalization, but that would be
costly and still would prevent the simultaneous (distinct) existance
of /usr/System and /usr/system, which is perfectly allowable under unix.
Right now, I do not have a good solution.

I will change the errormessage so that there will be more of a hint as to
what is wrong.

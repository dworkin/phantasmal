<h2> Bonus Section </h2>

<p>
  I've been working through DGD's Changelog and adding stuff in the
  appropriate places to this web site.  This is the bits of Changelog
  I haven't addressed yet.
</p>

<pre>
 - All of x[y .. z], x[y ..], x[.. y] and x[..] are now possible, with the
   obvious meanings.
 - Added mapping - array and mapping & array.


DGD 1.0.a7

 - path_object() (call_other, clone_object, find_object) from the auto
   object will no longer call the driver object to translate the path.
 - A new kfun is added, dump_state().  swapout() and shutdown() no longer
   do a state dump through a flag argument; dump_state() should be used
   instead.  dump_state(1) will create an incremental dump on top of an
   old one.


DGD 1.0.9

 - Added array | array (A + (B - A)) and array ^ array ((A - B) + (B - A)).

DGD 1.1

 - The type of (expr1 ? void : expr2) and (expr1 ? expr2 : void) is now always
   void.
 - The evaluation order of array and mapping aggregates is now left to right,
   because this is more intuitive.  From now on I'll consider the evalution
   order of aggregates and function arguments to be fixed, rather than
   undefined.
 - get_dir(foo) will always treat foo as a pattern, even if there is a file
   with that name.
 - Compile-time checking for too many string constants or function calls.
   The number of arrays and string values in an object can be larger than
   65535.  Replaced longs by Uints in swapping functions.  Extended ref
   counts to Uint for swapped-out data.
 - Process termination is now done through driver->interrupt().  This
   function must exist and should minimally consist of

    void interrupt() { shutdown(); }

 - Binary connections now have output buffering in the user object, instead
   of a 64K static buffer.  User objects that are buffering will not
   normally be swapped out.  The input buffer size for a binary connection
   has been increased to 8K.
 - Precompiled objects now replace existing objects silently, rather than
   causing an upgrade.  The object replaced must have the same inherit,
   string, function definition, variable definition and function call tables.
   NOTE: the dumpfile format was slightly changed, but state dumps that do
   not contain precompiled objects are unaffected.
 - Added a new status(obj) field, the "index" of the master object (the
   object itself unless it's a clone).  This is a unique ID, and will help
   distinguishing different issues of the same object, and linking clones
   to a particular issue.
 - Added mapping subranges.
 - Perform swapout, state dump and shutdown immediately upon completion of
   the thread in which they are initiated.
 - Changed the meaning of O_DATASIZE in status(obj): this now returns the
   number of variables, rather than the assumed amount of space they take.


 DGD 1.2

 - Added swapfile compression.
 - Increased max string length in status() to 65535.
 - Increased max editor output string length to 65535.
 - Added a new kfun, block_input().
 - Callouts with a delay of 0 seconds are now executed as soon as possible.
 - Sort callouts in status(obj) by handle rather than by delay, as no actual
   calling order for same-delay callouts can be guaranteed.
 - Completed parse_string implementation on all platforms.
 - New kfuns: query_ip_name(), send_datagram() (at present for Unix only).
 - Added the constant `nil'.  If typechecking is 0 or 1 (in the config file),
   nil has the value 0.  If typechecking has the value 2, nil is distinct from
   integer zero.
   String, object, array and mapping variables are initialized to nil.  Using
   call_other() to call a non-existant function returns nil.  Variables holding
   an object become nil after the object has been destructed.  Indexing a
   mapping with a non-existant index results in nil, and nil must be assigned
   to delete an index:value pair; assigning 0 has the same effect only when
   0 and nil are the same.
 - allocate() now allocates an array of nil values.  New kfuns allocate_int()
   and allocate_float() explicitly allocate arrays of those respective values.
 - In a further bit of type matching cleanup, integer 0 and floating point 0.0
   no longer test as equal.
 - It is now possible to use varargs in a parameter list to specify that only
   the following parameters are optional:

	void foo(int a, varargs string b, object c)
	{
	}

   In typechecking mode 2, this is the only way that varargs can be used.  It
   is an error to call a function with too many or too few arguments, even when
   using call_other() (typechecking mode 2 only).
   Varargs is implied for the last parameter when using ellipsis, and need no
   longer be specified explicitly.
 - Allow callouts with millisecond delays (floating point delay argument).
 - Check that a switch doesn't contain more than 32767 cases, and a function
   doesn't need more than 32767 values on the stack.
 - Put automatic object swapping, accidentally left out in the callout rewrite,
   back in.  NOTE: one out of every swap_fragment objects is now swapped out
   at the end of each thread, rather than each second.  This means that to get
   the same memory usage, the swap_fragment parameter should get a
   considerably larger value.
 - There is no need to use static, nomask or atomic in prototypes anymore.
   However, if any of these are specified, they must also be present in the
   actual function declaration.
 - In case of an error in atomic code, call driver->atomic_error() with the
   full stack trace.  Everything will be undone later, except for all use of
   send_message() by the driver object.
 - If there is no more input on a connection, make sure there is no pending
   output before closing it.
 - Temporarily disable compile_object(), clone_object(), destruct_object(),
   call_out() and remove_call_out() from within atomic code, making atomic safe
   to use.
 - Connections with pending output that failed in a write would never get
   closed.
 - Completed object undo (atomic functions).
   WARNING: before starting to use 1.1.97 with a statedump from a previous
   version, make sure there are no un-upgraded clones left in the statedump.
   This can be done by rebooting an additional time with the previous driver
   version, and immediately shutting down again with a statedump.
 - Made maximum sizes of strings more configurable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  ONLY GOT THIS FAR IN CULLING

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DGD 1.3

 - Don't allow "..." as a path component in Windows.
 - Using new_object() on a light-weight object will now return a copy.
 - Lightweight objects can now be upgraded.
 - DGD now has fully automatic garbage collection.  swapout() can still be
   used to reduce memory usage after a peak, or to track down memory leaks.
 - Added an optional second argument to compile_object(), a string to compile
   the object from.
 - Whitespace in a grammar is now given precedence based on its position in
   that grammar.  Previously, it always behaved as if it was the first token
   rule defined.
 - Grammars may now contain a "nomatch" token rule.
 - Implemented hash_crc32(), hash_sha1(), asn_add(), asn_sub(), asn_mult(),
   asn_div() and asn_mod().
 - Fixed some bugs, and implemented asn_cmp().
 - Fixed more bugs, and implemented asn_pow().
 - Implemented asn_lshift(), asn_rshift(), asn_and(), asn_or() and asn_xor().
 - Implemented tick accounting for ASN functions.
 - Implemented encrypt() and decrypt().
 - Allow allocation of blocks up to 1G in size.
 - Allow more than array_size callouts per object, for compatibility with
   DGD/MP.
 - New config file parameter: dump_interval, the expected time between two
   statedumps.  Rebuilding the swapfile is paced to this interval.
 - New kfun: call_touch().
 - call_touch() now also works on light-weight objects.

> I wondering if it is normal for inherit_program() in driver object to be called twise each time an object (that inherits something) is compiled.

Twice, or more often: that is normal.  DGD's compiler is not reentrant,
so if an inherited object is discovered not to exist, the current
compilation is aborted and the non-existing object is compiled first.
After that, the original object is compiled again, and inherit_program()
is called again.

The array_size config parameter controls the maximum size of both

Subject: [DGD] Virtual Rooms

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone knew how I could implement 'virtual rooms'
in DGD. Specifically the type that would let me generate a large
two-dimensional terrain where the room description would be set by
some equation.

Here is how a previous version of a LpMUD derivative I once used
accomplished this.

When you tried to go to a particular location or load a particular
object, such as "thomas/room/hallway.c" it would do 3 things, in this
order:

1. It would check if it's already loaded in memory. If so, it would use that.
2. If not, it would load up hallway.c and use that.
3. If hallway.c didn't exist, it would check to see if "thomas/room.c"
existed, and if so call the GetVirtualObject function within
"thomas/room.c" with the full string as an argument. If this function
existed, it would return a room object, and in memory rename it to
"thomas/room/hallway.c" so that future references to this would refer
to the loaded room.
4. If hallway.c didn't exist, or the GetVirtualObject function didn't
return a room, it would fail.

With this method you could easily create a large wilderness area by
creating a file like "thomas/wilderness.c" and referring to rooms like
"thomas/wilderness/1,1,1" and having the GetVirtualObject parse the
string to work out the coordinates and then set up the room by cloning
it and returning it.

Does anyone know if it's possible to do something similar in DGD, and
if so, how? I'm pretty new to DGD, I should point out, but so far it
looks pretty good! :)

Thanks,

Thomas.

Simple enough.  Either clone rooms in the area and refer to them using
your own custom naming scheme (e.g. "thomas/wilderness"->room_at(1,1,1))
or compile the room from a string instead of a file, and then
configure it as a clone:

    room = compile_object("thomas/wilderness/1,1,1",
			  read_file("thomas/wilderness.c"));
    room->set_long(etc);

The latter will require a recent version of DGD.

Subject: [DGD] Using MySQL C++ API

  Hi.  First, let me echo Keith Dunwoody's excellent sentiments.  He's
basically right.  Then let me summarize why quickly.

  DGD is really, really cool.  It does a couple of things that no other
language (except maybe the Cold server) does.  Unfortunately, those same
really cool tricks keep it from doing good callout to other, less-cool
languages.

  DGD allows atomic functions -- if DGD runs out of ticks or an error
occurs partway through, it just rolls the whole thing back, including
global variable writes, as though it never happened.  If you've been
calling out to code that doesn't do that, you can't roll it back because
you don't know all the half-assed stuff it's not finished doing yet.  If
you roll back in some obvious way and leave stuff half-done then chances
are really good that it'll crash when you next play with it.
  Believe me, I spent a long time trying to get Perl to be interruptible
in this way without constantly crashing the interpreter.  The only way I
figured out how to do it is one I'll recommend to you, but it boils down
to starting (and restarting, probably) a new server in a separate process
and never using it inside any atomic functions.  Your MySQL stuff isn't
currently atomic-able, so you can't mix it with DGD.

  DGD has exception handling that can cause similar problems, and most
speicifically the way it times out when it runs out of cycles -- again,
it's that interruptability problem.

  DGD's multithreading works the same way that its atomic functions do,
with speculative execution.  So that's right out as well.

  Essentially DGD is just really unfriendly to calling out to libraries in
other languages.  You can get around some of this by writing simple things
as chunks of DGD itself, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's trivial
(or easy, or reasonable) to do.  It also means that you now have to
distribute your own modified DGD for other people to run your
code.  That's a bad thing, especially in a community this small and
close-knit, who you'll be asking for help with debugging :-)

The only change since the posting of this grammar is the addition of
nil:

    primary_p1_exp: 'nil'

I love that grammar. :-)   I think maybe 'private inherit' is also new, 
though?  And, of course, somebody needs to write a LPC pre-processor... 
which is probably a bit of a chore. A day's work or three.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

One of my little side projects is to start generating reference 
documentation using doxygen.  Since there's not native support for LPC 
there, it seemed like the simplest way to get there was to use 
parse_string() and spit out C++ declarations equivalent to the LPC 
originals and use doxygen on that.

To that end, while trying to parse our player object, I found the 
following change to the grammar was needed (and Erwin seemed to agree 
that it was something that happened since the grammar was originally 
written) -- one of the varargs cases.  It is legal to use varargs in 
the list of arguments to a function, and the original grammar doesn't 
permit this.  I added the following production to make it happy:

	formal_declaration: 'varargs' type_specifier data_dcltr

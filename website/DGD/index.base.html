    Thanks to Felix Croes, aka Dworkin.  DGD is an incredible driver.
    With a little more documentation, a better <a
    href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">MUDLib</a> and some luck
    we can watch it sweep the world!

    Thanks to Rob Leslie for redirecting to this page from his own,
    and for carrying the DGD torch long before I was anywhere in the
    picture.  He's still out there, doing the LPMOO thing.

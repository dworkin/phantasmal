<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>Thanks to Felix Croes, aka Dworkin. DGD is an incredible driver.
With a little more documentation, a better <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">MUDLib</a> and some luck we can
watch it sweep the world!</p>

<p>Thanks to Rob Leslie for redirecting to this page from his own,
and for carrying the DGD torch long before I was anywhere in the
picture. He's still out there, doing the LPMOO thing.</p>

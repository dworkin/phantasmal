    <h2> What other DGD Web Sites are Out There? </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/">official one</a>, of
        course.</li>
        <li>A <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/">FAQ</a>,
          as you'd expect.</li>

        <li> There's a relatively new <a href="http://www.2-10.org/dgdwiki">
          DGD Wiki Web</a> which may be worth visiting.  If you have a
          question that you think others may share, this is probably one
          of the best ways to ask it.  You may want to email the DGD
          list to say you've posted it, though -- I expect that many of
          the DGD list folks aren't subscribed to the Wiki notification
          system for all the common pages. </li>

      <li>Rob's old page at http://www.mars.org/home/rob/dgd.html is
        now redirected to my top-level page.  His
        <a href="http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/lpmoo/">LPMOO</a>
        site remains intact. </li>

      <li>Some outdated <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/kfuns/">
          Kernel Function documentation</a></li>
      <li>Erlend Simonsen's
        <a href="http://gurba.sytes.net/~erlends/gurba.html">
          GurbaLib</a> page is around. </li>
      <li>Mikael eLeMeL Lind's
        <a href="http://www.mtek.chalmers.se/~z94lind/dgd/">
          DGD and LPC</a> page seems to be down. </li>

    <h2> What new features is DGD adding in the experimental branch? </h2>

    <p> DGD has recently added support for certain cryptographic
      operations, which have in turn permitted SSH support.  It has
      recently added support for unlimited numbers of incoming network
      ports.  There is also recent support for ASNs &mdash;
      arbitrary-precision signed numbers. </p>
    <p> There is a major overhaul planned to allow DGD to fully support
      multiprocessor functionality.  Dworkin has already done significant
      work in this direction though some of it has been rolled back.
      He's planning to release it under a different name, one he hasn't
      yet announced.  The name change will be accompanied by a change in
      the commercial license since the old licenseholder went under.  The
      terms of use for those of us who don't already hold a commercial
      DGD license should be basically identical. </p>

    <h2> The Pike language and how it relates to LPC and DGD </h2>

    <p>
      <a href="http://pike.roxen.com">Pike</a> is a language environment
      for a language which is
      <a href="http://pike.roxen.com/about/history/">closely related to
        LPC</a>.  You may find its documentation useful, and luckily, it's
      even <a href="http://pike.roxen.com/download/gpl/">released under
        the GPL</a>.

    <h2> Skotos Architecture </h2>

    <p> This is an example of the kind of edifice you could build on
      the Kernel MUDLib, pretty much unmodified.  You'd have to be
      as motivated as a company full of busy and inspired people to
      build something as
        cool as
        <a href="http://www.skotos.net"> Skotos </a> did, of course.

<h3>What new features is DGD adding in the experimental
branch?</h3>

<p>DGD has recently added support for certain cryptographic
operations, which allow SSH support. It has recently added support
for unlimited numbers of incoming network ports for both IPv4 and
IPv6, TCP/IP and UDP/IP. There is also recent support for ASNs
&mdash; arbitrary-precision signed numbers.</p>

<p>There is a major overhaul planned to allow DGD to fully support
multiprocessor functionality. Dworkin has already done significant
work in this direction though some of it has been rolled back (no
pun intended). He's planning to release it under a different name,
one he hasn't yet announced. The name change will be accompanied by
a change in the commercial license since the old licenseholder went
under. The terms of use for those of us who don't already hold a
commercial DGD license should be basically identical.</p><a name=

<h3>The Pike language and how it relates to LPC and DGD</h3>

<p><a href="http://pike.roxen.com">Pike</a> is a language
environment for a language which is <a href=
"http://pike.roxen.com/about/history/">closely related to LPC</a>.
You may find its documentation useful, and luckily, it's even
<a href="http://pike.roxen.com/download/gpl/">released under the
GPL</a>.</p>

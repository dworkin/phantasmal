  <h2> Separating Player LPC Objects from Body Objects </h2>

  <p>
    It's possible to separate a player's in-game presence into many
    parts, or few.  You can have separate LPC objects for the player,
    the network connection, the mobile (Skotos uses the phrase 'combat
    brain' for this) and the material body, or you can combine any or
    all of them into fewer objects, or just a single object.

    Melville separates the player&frasl;user&frasl;connection object
    from the user object, which is (among other things) the physical
    body object.  Phantasmal goes a step further and separates out the
    idea of a mobile into its own object.  These methods make it
    possible to do tricks like swapping bodies more easily, and to
    otherwise reassign network connections, at the cost of more files,
    and perhaps more complexity, in the player data.  Swapping bodies
    is particularly useful for wizards to test NPCs and impersonate
    others.  The TMI-2 MUDLib uses a similar trick for dead PCs having
    ghost bodies.

    Phantasmal separates the mobile object out specifically to more
    easily allow NPC actions and player actions to share code.  By
    making player actions &quot;more like&quot; NPC actions, the same
    functions can operate for both.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a persistent MUD, it's often useful to separate the player's
    presence into multiple objects because the connection object (the
    Kernel Library calls this the 'user' object) is transient, and
    goes away when the user disconnects, but the player data can be
    stored in other in-game objects.  By simply keeping those objects
    in existence and attaching them to a new connection&frasl;user
    object, you can maintain any modifications to them while never
    saving them to outside-the-MUD storage.

<titledef text="Player vs Body" />

<h2>Separating Player LPC Objects from Body Objects</h2>

<p>It's possible to separate a player's in-game presence into many LPC
objects, or few. You can have separate LPC objects for the player, the
network connection, the mobile (Skotos uses the phrase 'combat brain' to
refer to this object) and the material body, or you can combine any or
all of them to get fewer objects, or just a single object.</p>

<p>Melville separates the player&frasl;user&frasl;connection object from
the physical body object. Phantasmal goes a step further and separates
out the idea of a mobile into its own object. These methods make it
possible to do tricks like swapping bodies more easily, and to otherwise
reassign network connections, at the cost of more files, and perhaps
more complexity, in the player data. Swapping bodies is particularly
useful for wizards to test NPCs and impersonate others. The TMI-2 MUDLib
uses a similar trick for dead PCs having ghost bodies.</p>

<p>Phantasmal separates the mobile object out specifically to more
easily allow NPC actions and player actions to share code. By making
player actions "more like" NPC actions, the same functions can operate
for both. Skotos does a similar thing with their action&frasl;verb
separation.</p>

<p>In DGD, it's often useful to separate the player's presence into
multiple objects because the connection object is transient and goes
away when the user disconnects &mdash; DGD will destroy the network
connection object on disconnection. However, the player data can be
stored in other in-game objects. By simply keeping those objects in
existence and attaching them to a new connection object, you can
maintain any modifications to them while never saving them to
outside-the-MUD storage.</p>

<h3>Reassigning Connections</h3>

<p>In DGD, there is a single connection object that DGD recognizes as
representing any single network connection. DGD doesn't have specific
support for reassigning input from one connection to another, so you're
usually better off separating the connection into its own object and
having a way (in the other, non-connection objects) to reassign what
connection's input goes where. Why not have the driver do it? Because
DGD has the philosophy that nothing that can be easily done in LPC can
be done in the driver. The Kernel Library does the reassignment trick,
so obviously it can be done in LPC.</p>

<h3>Efficiency</h3>

<p>So does all this dividing stuff into objects waste a lot of space?
Well, it'll waste part of a sector for each object, at least if the
resulting objects are small. So that will probably cost you on the order
of a kilobyte for each connected player in your MUD. So if you have one
of the most popular MUDs on the internet, with about a thousand players
connected at peak, this will cost you about... a megabyte of memory. And
that's assuming you're doing a fair amount of dividing up objects.
Consider whether it's worth the difference in features and
maintainability, but the memory usage isn't a significant
difference.</p>

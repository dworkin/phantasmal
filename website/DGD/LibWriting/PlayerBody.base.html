<h2>Separating Player LPC Objects from Body Objects</h2>

<p>It's possible to separate a player's in-game presence into many
LPC objects, or few. You can have separate LPC objects for the
player, the network connection, the mobile (Skotos uses the phrase
'combat brain' to refer to this object) and the material body, or
you can combine any or all of them to get fewer objects, or just a
single object.</p>

<p>Melville separates the player&frasl;user&frasl;connection object
from the physical body object. Phantasmal goes a step further and
separates out the idea of a mobile into its own object. These
methods make it possible to do tricks like swapping bodies more
easily, and to otherwise reassign network connections, at the cost
of more files, and perhaps more complexity, in the player data.
Swapping bodies is particularly useful for wizards to test NPCs and
impersonate others. The TMI-2 MUDLib uses a similar trick for dead
PCs having ghost bodies.</p>

<p>Phantasmal separates the mobile object out specifically to more
easily allow NPC actions and player actions to share code. By
making player actions "more like" NPC actions, the same functions
can operate for both. Skotos does a similar thing with their
action&frasl;verb separation.</p>

<p>In DGD, it's often useful to separate the player's presence into
multiple objects because the connection object is transient and
goes away when the user disconnects &mdash; DGD will destroy the
network connection object on disconnection. However, the player
data can be stored in other in-game objects. By simply keeping
those objects in existence and attaching them to a new connection
object, you can maintain any modifications to them while never
saving them to outside-the-MUD storage.</p>

<h3>Reassigning Connections</h3>

<p>In DGD, there is a single connection object that DGD recognizes
as representing any single network connection. DGD doesn't have
specific support for reassigning input from one connection to
another, so you're usually better off separating the connection
into its own object and having a way (in the other, non-connection
objects) to reassign what connection's input goes where. Why not
have the driver do it? Because DGD has the philosophy that nothing
that can be easily done in LPC can be done in the driver. The
Kernel Library does the reassignment trick, so obviously it can be
done in LPC.</p>

<h3>Efficiency</h3>

<p>So does all this dividing stuff into objects waste a lot of
space? Well, it'll waste part of a sector for each object, at least
if the resulting objects are small. So that will probably cost you
on the order of a kilobyte for each connected player in your MUD.
So if you have one of the most popular MUDs on the internet, with
about a thousand players connected at peak, this will cost you
about... a megabyte of memory. And that's assuming you're doing a
fair amount of dividing up objects. Consider whether it's worth the
difference in features and maintainability, but the memory usage
isn't a significant difference.</p>

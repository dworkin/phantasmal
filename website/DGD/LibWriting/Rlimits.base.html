<h2>Using rlimits() in your Library</h2>

<p>The rlimits() DGD construct can be used to keep your MUD running
despite infinite loops and infinite recursions in code. In
combination with status(), it can be used for profiling your code
and keeping track of how much processor time each wizard, or each
function, is taking up. If you're not using the Kernel Library, you
need to understand rlimits() intimately to avoid infinite
recursions and loops. If you <i>are</i> using the Kernel Library,
it can still be useful here and there.</p>

<p>It turns out that rlimits() isn't actually a function, which is
why it can have the odd syntax it does. Specifically, it gets used
this way:</p>
<pre>
rlimits(-1;-1) {
  &frasl;* Some code goes here *&frasl;
}
  
</pre>

<p>Rlimits has two parameters, both set to -1 above. The first is
the limit on the stack depth, the second is the limit on the tick
count. If the code inside the curly braces exceeds either limit, an
error occurs. When either limit is -1, that means unlimited &mdash;
no limit to stack depth, or no limit to tick count.</p>

<p>The stack depth is a measure of how many functions are active at
once. Functions call each other, and those call other functions, to
greater and greater depth, and more data is allocated. As that
happens, the stack depth gets closer and closer to the limit. This
prevents an infinite (or just very deep) recursion inside the
rlimits() statement.</p>

<p>Ticks are a processor-independent measurement of how much time
the code is likely to take. Felix calls them "a weighted measure of
the number of instructions and the size of the datastructures
manipulated by these instructions". Since DGD focuses strongly on
compatibility, it's important that the measurement be
cross-platform. Each operation in DGD takes a number of ticks,
depending on what the operation is, and what data it is operating
on. Some operations, like 32-bit integer addition, will always take
the same number of ticks. Some operations, like parse_string(),
will take a widely-varying number of ticks, depending on what the
inputs to that operation are.</p>

<p>The status() call returns an array of interesting information.
One offset within this array is to the current tick count, which
increases over time as operations occur. This can be used to
determine how close to the tick limit your code is, and to profile
code or 'bill' different operations for the number of ticks they
use up.</p>

<p>The use of rlimits() is to prevent infinite recursions or
infinite loops in suspect code &mdash; code that you're not
entirely sure will return in a reasonable amount of time, or at
all. Any operation based on player data, for instance, is likely to
be in this category since somebody might want to bring your MUD to
a halt with a complicated operation. Your library may want to limit
its <i>own</i> actions as well, so that faulty code on your part is
less likely to crash the entire game.</p>

<p>To be <i>really</i> certain, just set up an rlimits() call from
every place that DGD calls into your code. That means the driver
object and the user object, several calls in each.</p>

<p>Good places to set rlimits() include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call_out calls (when they start executing, not when they're
  scheduled)</li>

  <li>compile_error(), runtime_error() in DRIVER object</li>

  <li>&lt;create&gt;() functions</li>

  <li>receive_message() in USER object</li>

  <li>open(), close() in USER object</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also be careful to specifically limit any
user-supplied code or builder-supplied code. If you have room
scripts or other (relatively) inessential code, don't be shy about
putting an rlimits() around it with a more restrictive set of
limits. That keeps such code from burning through too many of your
ticks.</p>

<p>Rlimits often goes well with a catch() statement so that if the
code runs too long or recurses too deep, you can log a more
meaningful error about exactly what code caused the problem.</p>

<p>You'll want to make sure that an rlimits() <i>inside</i> the one
you put in place can't override you. Somebody can put an
rlimits(-1;-1) somewhere inside the code you limited, and then the
error won't be caused if they go into an infinite loop. Luckily,
DGD will query your DRIVER object every time somebody attempts an
rlimits() statement, so you'll need to make sure your rlimits()
statement works (to limit them) and their doesn't work when they
try to override you. See the Kernel Library for good examples of
how to use rlimits(), including not letting the code you call
override your limits. The MudOSalike package, by Frank Schmidt, is
also a good example of rlimits().</p>

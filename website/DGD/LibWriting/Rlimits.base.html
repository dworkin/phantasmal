<h2>Using rlimits() in your Library</h2>

<p>The rlimits() DGD construct can be used to keep your MUD running
despite infinite loops and infinite recursions in code. In combination
with status(), it can be used for profiling your code and keeping track
of how much processor time each wizard, or each function, is taking up.
If you're not using the Kernel Library, you need to understand rlimits()
intimately to avoid infinite recursions and loops. If you <i>are</i>
using the Kernel Library, it can still be useful here and there.</p>

<p>It turns out that rlimits() isn't actually a function, which is why
it can have the odd syntax it does. Specifically, it gets used this
way:</p>
<pre>
rlimits(-1;-1) {
  &frasl;* Some code goes here *&frasl;
}
  </pre>

<p>Rlimits has two parameters, both set to -1 above. The first is the
limit on the stack depth, the second is the limit on the tick count. If
the code inside the curly braces exceeds either limit, an error occurs.
When either limit is -1, that means unlimited &mdash; no limit to stack
depth, or no limit to tick count.</p>

<p>The stack depth is a measure of how many functions are active at
once. Functions call each other, and those call other functions, to
greater and greater depth, and more data is allocated. As that happens,
the stack depth gets closer and closer to the limit. This prevents an
infinite (or just very deep) recursion inside the rlimits()
statement.</p>

<p>Ticks are a processor-independent measurement of how much time the
code is likely to take. Felix calls them "a weighted measure of the
number of instructions and the size of the datastructures manipulated by
these instructions". Since DGD focuses strongly on compatibility, it's
important that the measurement be cross-platform. Each operation in DGD
takes a number of ticks, depending on what the operation is, and what
data it is operating on. Some operations, like 32-bit integer addition,
will always take the same number of ticks. Some operations, like
parse_string(), will take a widely-varying number of ticks, depending on
what the inputs to that operation are.</p>

<p>The status() call returns an array of interesting information. One
offset within this array is to the current tick count, which increases
over time as operations occur. This can be used to determine how close
to the tick limit your code is, and to profile code or 'bill' different
operations for the number of ticks they use up.</p>

<p>The use of rlimits() is to prevent infinite recursions or infinite
loops in suspect code &mdash; code that you're not entirely sure will
return in a reasonable amount of time, or at all. Any operation based on
player data, for instance, is likely to be in this category since
somebody might want to bring your MUD to a halt with a complicated
operation. Your library may want to limit its <i>own</i> actions as
well, so that faulty code on your part is less likely to crash the
entire game.</p>

<p>To be <i>really</i> certain, just set up an rlimits() call from every
place that DGD calls into your code. That means the driver object and
the user object, several calls in each.</p>

<p>Good places to set rlimits() include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>call_out calls (when they start executing, not when they're
  scheduled)</li>

  <li>compile_error(), runtime_error() in DRIVER object</li>

  <li>&lt;create&gt;() functions</li>

  <li>receive_message() in USER object</li>

  <li>open(), close() in USER object</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also be careful to specifically limit any user-supplied
code or builder-supplied code. If you have room scripts or other
(relatively) inessential code, don't be shy about putting an rlimits()
around it with a more restrictive set of limits. That keeps such code
from burning through too many of your ticks.</p>

<p>Rlimits often goes well with a catch() statement so that if the code
runs too long or recurses too deep, you can log a more meaningful error
about exactly what code caused the problem.</p>

<p>You'll want to make sure that an rlimits() <i>inside</i> the one you
put in place can't override you. Somebody can put an rlimits(-1;-1)
somewhere inside the code you limited, and then the error won't be
caused if they go into an infinite loop. Luckily, DGD will query your
DRIVER object every time somebody attempts an rlimits() statement, so
you'll need to make sure your rlimits() statement works (to limit them)
and their doesn't work when they try to override you. See the Kernel
Library for good examples of how to use rlimits(), including not letting
the code you call override your limits. The MudOSalike package, by Frank
Schmidt, is also a good example of rlimits().</p>

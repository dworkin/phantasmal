<h2>Miscellaneous Issues in MUD Security</h2>

<p>Have a set of core objects that define basic behaviour and
limitations which cannot be rewritten from within the mud, not even
by the mud administrator. The Kernel Library puts these in the
/kernel directory. It does this to enforce security limits. You
should too if you don't already have the Kernel do it for you.</p>

<p>Never keep the config file (the one ending in .dgd) inside the
MUD code tree. It could be overwritten and used to give an attacker
access to files outside the mudlib, such as the password file on
the host system. Changing it can also allow your MUD to masquerade
as a different service, and potentially open different incoming
ports.</p>

<p>If you've patched DGD with the network package, it can easily
cause your MUD to be usable as a relay or a zombie for a
distributed attack on other systems. So be careful how this can be
used from LPC, and pay attention to what particular users can or
cannot do.</p>

<p>Don't put the swapfile in the mudlib directory, either, since
information which is otherwise hidden inside objects will be
readable from it.</p>

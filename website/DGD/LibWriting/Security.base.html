  <h2> Miscellaneous Issues in MUD Security </h2>

  <p>
    Have a set of core objects that define basic behaviour and
    limitations which cannot be rewritten from within the mud, not
    even by the mud administrator.  The Kernel Library puts these in
    the &frasl;kernel directory.  This is to enforce security limits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Never keep the config file (the one ending in .dgd) inside the MUD
    code tree.  It could be overwritten and used to give an attacker
    access to files outside the mudlib, such as the password file on
    the host system.  Changing it can also allow your MUD to
    masquerade as a different service, and potentially open different
    incoming ports.  If you're using the network package, it can
    easily cause your MUD to be usable as a relay or a zombie for a
    distributed attack on other systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't put the swapfile in the mudlib directory, either, since
    information which is otherwise hidden inside objects will be
    readable from it.

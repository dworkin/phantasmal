<h2>Miscellaneous Issues in MUD Security</h2>

<p>Have a set of core objects that define basic behaviour and
limitations which cannot be rewritten from within the mud, not even by
the mud administrator. The Kernel Library puts these in the /kernel
directory. It does this to enforce security limits. You should too if
you don't already have the Kernel do it for you.</p>

<p>Never keep the config file (the one ending in .dgd) inside the MUD
code tree. It could be overwritten and used to give an attacker access
to files outside the mudlib, such as the password file on the host
system. Changing it can also allow your MUD to masquerade as a different
service, and potentially open different incoming ports.</p>

<p>If you've patched DGD with the network package, it can easily cause
your MUD to be usable as a relay or a zombie for a distributed attack on
other systems. So be careful how this can be used from LPC, and pay
attention to what particular users can or cannot do.</p>

<p>Don't put the swapfile in the mudlib directory, either, since
information which is otherwise hidden inside objects will be readable
from it.</p>

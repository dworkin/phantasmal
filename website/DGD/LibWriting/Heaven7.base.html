  <h2> Implementing From Heaven7 </h2>

  <p>
    The DGD Mailing List has the honor of being frequently read by
    Neil McBride, also known as Sarak, who was one of the primary
    implementors of the Heaven7 MUDLib.  He highly recommends that,
    rather than porting an architecturally outdated lib like H7 to
    DGD, you plan to simply rewrite it in a cleaner, more modern way
    and wind up implementing the same functionality.

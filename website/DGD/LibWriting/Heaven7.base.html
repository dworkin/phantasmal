<h2>Implementing From Heaven7</h2>

<p>The DGD Mailing List has the honor of being frequently read by Neil
McBride, also known as Sarak, who was one of the primary implementors of
the Heaven7 MUDLib. He highly recommends that, rather than porting an
architecturally outdated lib like H7 to DGD, you plan to simply rewrite
it in a cleaner, more modern way and wind up implementing the same
functionality.</p>

  <h2> What License Should I Use For My Library? </h2>

  <p>
    There are a number of different licenses that can be used for a
    MUD Library, or indeed for any other piece of software.  It
    <i>is</i> worth remembering that several standard licenses (GPL,
    LGPL) simply don't work the same way for a MUD server that they do
    for most applications.  That's not an exclusion in the license,
    but rather the fact that the license provides limits on binary
    distribution.  Programs that are rarely or never distributed as a
    binary, such as MUD servers, get around a lot of the restrictions
    in licenses like the GPL that specifically restrict binary
    distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can find a somewhat impassioned description of licensing and
    its effects to date on the MUD community <a
    href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo3.phtml">here</a>.
    Disclaimer: I wrote that article.  Obviously, I'm biased.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Phantasmal MUD library would use the GPL if it accomplished
    the same thing for MUD servers that it did elsewhere.  Instead,
    Phantasmal is simply public domain.  Here's <a
    href="http://phantasmal.sf.net/License.html">the reason for
    that</a>.

How about finishing and releasing it, first :)

This is definitely on-topic.

It is quite normal for companies to be using software components with
different licenses.  I see no objection to anyone writing a commercially
usable mudlib, as long as they keep in mind that anyone who can afford
an expensive commercial license can probably also afford to write a
basic mudlib, especially if starting with the kernel library.  You have
to be as confident about your mudlib as I am of selling expensive DGD
licenses.

(Note that the kernel library is in the public domain, so it can be
integrated into a mudlib without any license conflicts.)

This isn't quite correct.  The source for DGD is available, and may be
distributed, but a real Open Source license requires no restrictions on
commercial use.

  Yes.  But each one adds overhead.  I work for Palm, and I've worked on
licensed code (our FAT filesystem, for instance), and there are a number
of aspects of the license agreement that are painful.  Companies do so,
but they do it cautiously and prefer not to at all.  That's good judgement
on their part if my experience is typical.
  So if the company wanted to license DGD, then license a separate base
MUDLib, then license a couple of other components in addition (Geir Harald
Hansen's objectd, for instance), that would be inconvenient.

  Naturally.  I'm assuming that's what Skotos did since I'm not seeing
stuff comparable to theirs available for free :-)  I'm not suggesting that
I'd be likely to get any takers on *my* MUDLib any time soon...

  Right.  Which is why I say the server source is "already available", not
"Open Source".  I guess the MUDLib couldn't be technically Open Source
unless it could be distributed as a binary.  Maybe as a state dump?
  But no, I just meant that Open Source licenses fail to address the needs
of a MUDLib since the binary form is almost never distributed anyway.
For something in the same spirit, perhaps an "Open MUD License" could
require that any player of the MUD be able to download the MUDLib source
code from a web site.  That's what CthulhuMUD does, though I don't think
it's required by their license.  They're not DGD-based, of course.
  A license doing that would guarantee that anybody who used the MUDLib
and added new features had to contribute them back to the community, like
the GPL does with applications.

  Yes.  There's a fine line to figure out between MUDLib and
content.  You'd like the objectd to have to be distributed, but you
wouldn't want the room descriptions to be.  Since DGD allows you to put
code into text files, just dividing into source (.c, .h, etc) files and
data (.txt, etc) files doesn't cut it -- you could compile a .txt file
into an object.  For that matter, you can't even say "if it compiles as
DGD LPC code, you have to redistribute" since they could write an
interpreter for another language.
  But in the same way that the GPL defines the source code as "the
preferred form for modifying" an application, we'd need a definition of
what needed to be redistributed, and divide it into MUDLib and
content.  It's definitely a subtle distinction.

  And this is where the content/lib distinction is important.  You'd like
the quests to be content and (for instance) the rules of combat to be part
of the lib.  The combat code should have to be redistributed, the quests
shouldn't.  Or maybe neither of those should have to be redistributed, but
anything in the /usr/System directory should...  It's hard to figure out
how to formulate the requirement.
  One idea I've (just) had would be to have the MUD set up .desc files
containing objects, rooms, etc with very specific, limited bits of code in
them to do things.  You could make those exempt from redistribution.  But
of course, there are ways around pretty much any system like that,
especially if the server folks can modify the server code itself...

  The things that come to mind as being in that category would include how
commands work, the statistics for combat and items, etc.  Not so much the
items and stats themselves, as how they affect things like how often you
hit, how much damage you do, what flags exist for rooms...  And my answer
to that is that your players *will* have that information if they want
it.  If you think you can hide that from them on even a moderately
popular server or lib, you're wrong.  I cite the MUD-Dev list for source
material to back that up, or your choice of UO, Asheron's Call or
Everquest.  Even if you're a statistical God, the players will figure out
the stats behind all your systems to any degree of exactness they
want.  It's not like you don't give them enough sample points...

  It's up to the licensor of the code to decide whether that's acceptable,
but yes, that's one possibility :-)

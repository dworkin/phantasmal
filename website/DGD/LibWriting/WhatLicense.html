  <h2> What License Should I Use For My Library? </h2>

  <p>
    There are a number of different licenses that can be used for a
    MUD Library, or indeed for any other piece of software.  It
    <i>is</i> worth remembering that several standard licenses (GPL,
    LGPL) simply don't work the same way for a MUD server that they do
    for most applications.  That's not an exclusion in the license,
    but rather the fact that the license provides limits on binary
    distribution.  Programs that are rarely or never distributed as a
    binary, such as MUD servers, get around a lot of the restrictions
    in licenses like the GPL that specifically restrict binary
    distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can find a somewhat impassioned description of licensing and
    its effects to date on the MUD community <a
    href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo3.phtml">here</a>.
    Disclaimer: I wrote that article.  Obviously, I'm biased.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Phantasmal MUD library would use the GPL if it accomplished
    the same thing for MUD servers that it did elsewhere.  Instead,
    Phantasmal is simply public domain.  Here's <a
    href="http://phantasmal.sf.net/License.html">the reason for
    that</a>.
  </p>

  <h3> Why Is Licensing Content Hard? </h3>

  <p>
    MUDs aren't the only arena where there are some problems
    separating content from code, and figuring out what license goes
    where.  For instance, a lot of games use art.  A GPL'd game
    doesn't use GPL'd art, because there's not really any such thing
    as GPL'd art.  Instead, the art is usually licensed in some other
    way, or is treated as part of the source code.  But most
    frequently these days, the art is licensed separately if it's any
    good.
  </p>

  <p>
    MUD descriptions, areas, mobiles and even builder scripts are
    essentially in the same category.  They are a work of art,
    produced in the MUD medium.  That means it's in your best
    interests to be able to license them separately from your MUD.
    Your MUD's license probably talks mainly about code and
    executables (binaries), and that's only vaguely applicable to art.
    Maybe your object scripts are covered, but your descriptions and
    things really aren't.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, in some ways, this is all an open issue.  It's hard to
    tell exactly where the legal lines are drawn.  Your best bet is to
    separately license the artistic content and then not give it to
    anybody without making that license very clear.  Distributing it
    separately from your MUD code is probably a really good idea if
    they have different licenses.
  </p>

  <h3> Derived Works </h3>

  <p>
    Under copyright law, if you start from somebody else's work and
    add your own to it, you've made a derivative work from theirs.
    That means, essentially, that they have part ownership of what you
    just made, because you made it from their work too.  It's a little
    like the fact that you can't go draw your own Mickey Mouse cartoon
    with Pluto and Goofy and then expect Disney to just look the other
    way.  They (reasonably and correctly) believe that the law
    protects them from you doing that.  It means that even if you only
    put them into, say, 30% of your cartoon, and they don't even take
    up the whole picture in that 30%, you still can't sell the movie
    because &quot;most of it is mine, not theirs&quot;.  Copyright law
    doesn't work that way.
  </p>

  <p>
    The thing is, if you were to remove that 30% from your movie, it's
    still not entirely clear that you fully own it.  Because what
    you've done is to make another derivative work of that
    <i>first</i> derivative work, the one that you and Disney owned
    jointly (not that they'd ever let you release it).
  </p>

  <p>
    Why am I bringing this up?  Well, some of you may be familiar with
    the den of thieves that is the current MUD development community.
    It's extremely common to see people basically file the serial
    numbers off somebody's codebase and claim it as their own.  The
    most famous example is <a
    href="http://www.medievia.com">Medievia</a>, which has added a
    tremendous amount of code and functionality, but is still very
    clearly built on a Diku (Merc) base.  Builders like <a
    href="http://www.kavir.org">KaVir</a> who have worked on Medievia
    have <a
    href="http://520006811875-0001.bei.t-online.de/med.html">confirmed
    that fact</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When and if you find somebody has stolen your code, please bring
    up the above facts about derivative works.  And if you're thinking
    of taking &quot;just a couple of functions&quot; from another
    codebase and you don't plan to obey their license, please remember
    that you will be using that code <i>illegally</i>, and if you
    <i>ever</i> plan to make money off it, or even run a public MUD
    based on it, you can never safely do so.  You'll always have to
    worry about whether, for instance, a rogue builder with a
    conscience might discover your illegal act and (as KaVir did with
    Vryce) turn you in and show the community that you're a criminal.
    And, as in Vryce's case, you <i>will</i> be a criminal, so your
    counter arguments will all sound really, really stupid and lame.
  </p>

  <p>
    This happens <i>all</i> the time.  Can we please, <i>please</i>
    stop stealing from each other now?
  </p>

  <h3> License Incompatibility </h3>

  <p>
    Some licenses don't work together.  For instance, if you have code
    under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software
    Foundation's</a> GNU Public License, you can't link it into code
    that uses the Diku license, nor the LPMUD license.  Those licenses
    are incompatible because there is no way to satisfy the legalese
    of the GPL while simulataneously legally distributing under the
    Diku or LPMUD license.  This is another common MUD community
    fallacy.  Please don't distribute code illegally.  <i>Please</i>?
  </p>

  <p>
    The easiest way to avoid this trap is to sit down and fully read
    the license for the code you're going to use.  Make sure you've
    read the license and you understand what it means.  The Free
    Software Foundation have several pages that carefully explain each
    of their licenses, and what those licenses require of you.  You
    should read those if you're going to use an FSF license.  Please
    don't distribute code illegally.  No, seriously, I mean <i>you</i>
    shouldn't.  No more distributing illegal code.  Why would you do
    it?  You're breaking the law if you do, and anybody who bothers to
    check can tell that you're doing it.  That's just stupid.
  </p>

  <h3> Commercial Use </h3>

  <p>
    First, go back up and read the 'Derived Works' section again.  No,
    seriously, go <i>do</i> it.  Okay, now that you're certain (you
    <i>are</i> certain, aren't you?) that you have the legal right to
    use all your code commercially, and you're sure that
    <i>nowhere</i> in the development process did you use somebody
    else's code and sweep that fact under the rug, you can begin.
  </p>

  <p>
    First off, when thinking about whether you'll use your code
    commercially, and whether you'll let somebody <i>else</i> use your
    code commercially, make sure you understand the licenses involved.
    Some licenses, like Diku and LPMUD, prevent it entirely.  Please
    don't use that code illegally.
  </p>

  <p>
    But let's say you're using something like Phantasmal as your
    MUDlib, something that doesn't impose any limits on you.  Now make
    sure your server can be used commercially.  In Phantasmal's case,
    that means <a href="../Skotos/CommercialUse.html">commercially
    using DGD</a>, which can be tricky.  If you're writing based on
    Melville, you'll need to get a license through Steve Schmidt, aka
    MobyDick, the author.  Remember that 'Derived Works' thing?  It
    applies to Melville, too, and Steve requires you to get a license
    to use his work commercially.  If you originally started from
    Melville, you can't legally run your MUD commercially without
    paying him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be aware that if you're running a MUD commercially, you could be
    liable for <i>much</i> larger legal penalties if you're caught
    violating somebody's license.  That's because at that point, it's
    effectively considered theft.  And they can even tell, with some
    work, just how much money you stole from the author by not paying
    him.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're releasing <i>your</i> code for possible commercial use,
    though, have a look at the license for Melville.  It's very
    simple, and boils down to 'you have to get a license to use it.'
    Or you could go the full-on Phantasmal route and just say 'use it
    and don't worry about me.'  I'm a big fan of that approach, but
    that's partially because I <i>know</i> how many weenies will steal
    my code if it's any good, and I never want to have to worry about
    suing them.

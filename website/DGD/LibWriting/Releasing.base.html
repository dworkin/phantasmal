  <h2> Should You Release the Source to Your MUD Library? </h2>

  <p>
    This has been a hotly-debated topic for quite a long time
    throughout the MUD community.  Obviously, at some level it's a
    matter of choice.  But there has been a lot of good debate on the
    subject, and it's worth summarizing it to help avoid some of the
    repetition that usually dominates mailing-list discussion on the
    topic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reasons that Releasing is a Good Idea:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> You get to contribute to something much greater than just your own
      MUD </li>
    <li> DGD is severely lacking in functional, usable, and game-oriented
      mudlibs </li>
    <li> You could potentially benefit from those people that add new
      functionality to your source. </li>
    <li> Much bigger pool of users to draw from as far as tracking bugs
      and playtesting </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Reasons that Releasing is a Bad Idea:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Harder to find time for your own MUD due to MUDLib users asking
      for their own maintenance and changes </li>
    <li> You may lose all functional uniqueness due to numerous clones
      of your MUD </li>
    <li> Open to subjective public criticism on design paradigms (not
      really a problem, just an annoyance) </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Commentary From People Who Have Released </h3>

  <p>
    George Reese, author of the NightMare MUDLib (LPMUD, but not for
    DGD), has this to say:
  </p>

  <span style="font-color: #FF00FF">

    <p>
      [People contributing new features] does not happen much at the
      mudlib level.  The mudlib is where people are differentiating
      themselves heavily.  Of the things I received for NM, only a
      couple ever made it into the distribution either because the
      ideas were so peculiar or the code sucked so bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't count on [a larger pool of testers] at the mudlib level :)
      95% of all bug reports are useless.  They are generally people
      misusing the lib or who simply don't know a bug from a hole in
      their head.  The other 5% are useful, but drowned out in the
      noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      [Attention being focused on lib development, not MUD
      development] is actually a plus, IMHO.  But it assumes you have
      separated the duties of running the mud into taking care of the
      lib and those who take care of the game.  Specifically, it
      allows you to view features people are asking for *on the mud*
      in a more generic context and thus allows you to come up with
      more flexible solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      [Other people cloning your MUD] is a HUGE problem... especially
      a year or two down the road.  More specifically, every mud has
      the problem of player X disagrees with the admins and declares
      he or she will start their own mud.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guess what.  If your mudlib is being publically distributed, not
      only can they start their own mud, but they can start one JUST
      LIKE yours.  And then they can come back to your mud and say
      &quot;we have started a mud just like [yours], except it is run
      by players who remember what it is like to be a player&quot; (as
      if you somehow don't have a clue).
    </p>

    <p>
      This is 90% of why I removed NM from distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subjective criticism is not the problem.  It is the pot shots.
      Especially from people who don't have a clue.  You will have a
      bit of a honeymoon for a while on this one though since you will
      be the only developed game lib for DGD.
    </p>

    <p>
      And don't forget having to provide tech support for people using
      the lib!
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the physical area is much more important than the actual
      lib.  The lib only determine how easily you can accomplish what
      is possible without affecting existing systems.  It cannot make
      you more creative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is if you get the situation [of] people intent on
      copying your mud.  Having the same mudlib makes it much easier
      to do so, even if you do not release the main town and such.

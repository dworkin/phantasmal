<h2>Should You Release the Source to Your MUD Library?</h2>

<p>This has been a hotly-debated topic for quite a long time
throughout the MUD community. Obviously, at some level it's a
matter of choice. But there has been a lot of good debate on the
subject, and it's worth summarizing it to help avoid some of the
repetition that usually dominates mailing-list discussion on the
topic.</p>

<p>Reasons that Releasing is a Good Idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You get to contribute to something much greater than just
  your own MUD</li>

  <li>DGD is severely lacking in functional, usable, and
  game-oriented mudlibs</li>

  <li>You could potentially benefit from those people that add new
  functionality to your source.</li>

  <li>Much bigger pool of users to draw from as far as tracking
  bugs and playtesting</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons that Releasing is a Bad Idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harder to find time for your own MUD due to MUDLib users
  asking for their own maintenance and changes</li>

  <li>You may lose all functional uniqueness due to numerous clones
  of your MUD</li>

  <li>Open to subjective public criticism on design paradigms (not
  really a problem, just an annoyance)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 'Stock MUD' Argument</h3>

<p>If you release a reasonably runnable MUD that people use, you'll
find that the areas you supply are used as stock areas. It's not
really avoidable. Is that a good or a bad thing?</p>

<p>If you distributed a library with no predefined 'areas' then you
could largely avoid this. But is it bad to be recognizable in terms
of the feel of the library? For players it's a good thing, since
familiar means comfortable as a rule. However, it's not clear that
beginner 'stock' areas are as valuable as say, a known, common set
of commands.</p>

<p>Dworkin's suggestion is to release only part of your mudlib.
Include the base classes, but not the actual rooms and objects.
That way you won't have to fear the 100 identical clones. Just
include a few example rooms with a few example monsters (adjust to
whatever your mudlib actually contains). This suggestion can be
annoying to initially set up since you'll need a release process
that strips out the appropriate files. However, once you have it in
place, it avoids other people cloning your MUD unless they can
rewrite a *lot* of game-specific code.</p>

<h3>"I'll Release When It Works" Syndrome</h3>

<p>I know of more DGD MUD Libraries that have abandoned
development, never released, than have ever been released in total
for DGD. Of those libraries, all but two or three were going to
release code as soon as it worked correctly. When they had a
release that satisfied them, they were going to make sure everybody
could use it. Not one of them ever released a line of code. Their
good ideas, their starting MUD code, every line of text and code is
gone.</p>

<p>John McKenna 'released' his "Inferno" MUD Library when I found
it on an FTP server, almost by accident, and asked if I could link
to it. He didn't send out links publicly, to my knowledge. He
certainly didn't intend it to be broadly used. But by agreeing to
let me link to it, he contributed more to the current DGD community
than every one of the MUDLib efforts that were abandoned
unreleased. More than all of them put together. And all he ever
contributed was an example MUDLib, and not one that very many
people look at.</p>

<p>If you're writing a MUD Library and you're planning to release
code, please, please don't wait until it works. If you do, chances
are very good that we'll never see a line of your code, ever. You
might just contribute one decent subsystem of your MUD
(Phantasmal's HelpD and I/O have both been used in other MUDs long
before Phantasmal was playable). But even if that's all anybody
ever sees, you've still contributed <i>something</i>. Are you
really that dedicated to making sure all of your effort is lost
forever?</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Technical Support</h3>

<p>Some people worry that if they release their MUD Library code,
they'll have to provide technical support to all the people who
want to use it. This is a valid concern. However, you'll find that
you can always tell them to bugger off, particularly if you've
written decent documentation. However, the success of your MUD
Library in the world at large will absolutely depend on your
willingness to provide support to developers who try to use it.</p>

<p>Dworkin says: use a DGD-like policy with regard to changes: make
clear that you will be very happy with bugfixes, but will only
include those "enhancements" that you yourself like.</p>

<h3>Commentary From People Who Have Released</h3>

<p>George Reese, author of the NightMare MUDLib (LPMUD, but not for
DGD), has this to say:</p>

<div style="color: #FF0080">
  <p>[People contributing new features] does not happen much at the
  mudlib level. The mudlib is where people are differentiating
  themselves heavily. Of the things I received for NM, only a
  couple ever made it into the distribution either because the
  ideas were so peculiar or the code sucked so bad.</p>

  <p>Don't count on [a larger pool of testers] at the mudlib level
  :) 95% of all bug reports are useless. They are generally people
  misusing the lib or who simply don't know a bug from a hole in
  their head. The other 5% are useful, but drowned out in the
  noise.</p>

  <p>[Attention being focused on lib development, not MUD
  development] is actually a plus, IMHO. But it assumes you have
  separated the duties of running the mud into taking care of the
  lib and those who take care of the game. Specifically, it allows
  you to view features people are asking for *on the mud* in a more
  generic context and thus allows you to come up with more flexible
  solutions.</p>

  <p>[Other people cloning your MUD] is a HUGE problem...
  especially a year or two down the road. More specifically, every
  mud has the problem of player X disagrees with the admins and
  declares he or she will start their own mud.</p>

  <p>Guess what. If your mudlib is being publically distributed,
  not only can they start their own mud, but they can start one
  JUST LIKE yours. And then they can come back to your mud and say
  "we have started a mud just like [yours], except it is run by
  players who remember what it is like to be a player" (as if you
  somehow don't have a clue).</p>

  <p>This is 90% of why I removed NM from distribution.</p>

  <p>Subjective criticism is not the problem. It is the pot shots.
  Especially from people who don't have a clue. You will have a bit
  of a honeymoon for a while on this one though since you will be
  the only developed game lib for DGD.</p>

  <p>And don't forget having to provide tech support for people
  using the lib!</p>

  <p>I think the physical area is much more important than the
  actual lib. The lib only determine how easily you can accomplish
  what is possible without affecting existing systems. It cannot
  make you more creative.</p>

  <p>The problem is if you get the situation [of] people intent on
  copying your mud. Having the same mudlib makes it much easier to
  do so, even if you do not release the main town and such.</p>

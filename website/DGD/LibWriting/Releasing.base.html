@@TITLE Releasing Code@@

<h2>Should You Release the Source to Your MUD Library?</h2>

<p>This has been a hotly-debated topic for quite a long time throughout
the MUD community. Obviously, at some level it's a matter of choice. But
there has been a lot of good debate on the subject, and it's worth
summarizing it to help avoid some of the repetition that usually
dominates mailing-list discussion on the topic.</p>

<p>Reasons that Releasing is a Good Idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You get to contribute to something much greater than just your own
  MUD</li>

  <li>DGD is severely lacking in functional, usable, and game-oriented
  mudlibs</li>

  <li>You could potentially benefit from those people that add new
  functionality to your source.</li>

  <li>Much bigger pool of users to draw from as far as tracking bugs and
  playtesting</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons that Releasing is a Bad Idea:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harder to find time for your own MUD due to MUDLib users asking
  for their own maintenance and changes</li>

  <li>You may lose all functional uniqueness due to numerous clones of
  your MUD</li>

  <li>Open to subjective public criticism on design paradigms (not
  really a problem, just an annoyance)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The 'Stock MUD' Argument</h3>

<p>If you release a reasonably runnable MUD that people use, you'll find
that the areas you supply are used as stock areas. It's not really
avoidable. Is that a good or a bad thing?</p>

<p>If you distributed a library with no predefined 'areas' then you
could largely avoid this. But is it bad to be recognizable in terms of
the feel of the library? For players it's a good thing, since familiar
means comfortable as a rule. However, it's not clear that beginner
'stock' areas are as valuable as say, a known, common set of
commands.</p>

<p>Dworkin's suggestion is to release only part of your mudlib. Include
the base classes, but not the actual rooms and objects. That way you
won't have to fear the 100 identical clones. Just include a few example
rooms with a few example monsters (adjust to whatever your mudlib
actually contains). This suggestion can be annoying to initially set up
since you'll need a release process that strips out the appropriate
files. However, once you have it in place, it avoids other people
cloning your MUD unless they can rewrite a *lot* of game-specific
code.</p>

<h3>"I'll Release When It Works" Syndrome</h3>

<p>I know of more DGD MUD Libraries that have abandoned development,
never released, than have ever been released in total for DGD. Of those
libraries, all but two or three were going to release code as soon as it
worked correctly. When they had a release that satisfied them, they were
going to make sure everybody could use it. Not one of them ever released
a line of code. Their good ideas, their starting MUD code, every line of
text and code is gone.</p>

<p>John McKenna 'released' his "Inferno" MUD Library when I found it on
an FTP server, almost by accident, and asked if I could link to it. He
didn't send out links publicly, to my knowledge. He certainly didn't
intend it to be broadly used. But by agreeing to let me link to it, he
contributed more to the current DGD community than every one of the
MUDLib efforts that were abandoned unreleased. More than all of them put
together. And all he ever contributed was an example MUDLib, and not one
that very many people look at.</p>

<p>If you're writing a MUD Library and you're planning to release code,
please, please don't wait until it works. If you do, chances are very
good that we'll never see a line of your code, ever. You might just
contribute one decent subsystem of your MUD (Phantasmal's HelpD and I/O
have both been used in other MUDs long before Phantasmal was playable).
But even if that's all anybody ever sees, you've still contributed
<i>something</i>. Are you really that dedicated to making sure all of
your effort is lost forever?</p>

<h3>Maintenance and Technical Support</h3>

<p>Some people worry that if they release their MUD Library code,
they'll have to provide technical support to all the people who want to
use it. This is a valid concern. However, you'll find that you can
always tell them to bugger off, particularly if you've written decent
documentation. However, the success of your MUD Library in the world at
large will absolutely depend on your willingness to provide support to
developers who try to use it.</p>

<p>Dworkin says: use a DGD-like policy with regard to changes: make
clear that you will be very happy with bugfixes, but will only include
those "enhancements" that you yourself like.</p>

<h3>Commentary From People Who Have Released</h3>

<p>George Reese, author of the NightMare MUDLib (LPMUD, but not for
DGD), has this to say:</p>

<div style="color: #FF0080">
  <p>[People contributing new features] does not happen much at the
  mudlib level. The mudlib is where people are differentiating
  themselves heavily. Of the things I received for NM, only a couple
  ever made it into the distribution either because the ideas were so
  peculiar or the code sucked so bad.</p>

  <p>Don't count on [a larger pool of testers] at the mudlib level :)
  95% of all bug reports are useless. They are generally people misusing
  the lib or who simply don't know a bug from a hole in their head. The
  other 5% are useful, but drowned out in the noise.</p>

  <p>[Attention being focused on lib development, not MUD development]
  is actually a plus, IMHO. But it assumes you have separated the duties
  of running the mud into taking care of the lib and those who take care
  of the game. Specifically, it allows you to view features people are
  asking for *on the mud* in a more generic context and thus allows you
  to come up with more flexible solutions.</p>

  <p>[Other people cloning your MUD] is a HUGE problem... especially a
  year or two down the road. More specifically, every mud has the
  problem of player X disagrees with the admins and declares he or she
  will start their own mud.</p>

  <p>Guess what. If your mudlib is being publically distributed, not
  only can they start their own mud, but they can start one JUST LIKE
  yours. And then they can come back to your mud and say "we have
  started a mud just like [yours], except it is run by players who
  remember what it is like to be a player" (as if you somehow don't have
  a clue).</p>

  <p>This is 90% of why I removed NM from distribution.</p>

  <p>Subjective criticism is not the problem. It is the pot shots.
  Especially from people who don't have a clue. You will have a bit of a
  honeymoon for a while on this one though since you will be the only
  developed game lib for DGD.</p>

  <p>And don't forget having to provide tech support for people using
  the lib!</p>

  <p>I think the physical area is much more important than the actual
  lib. The lib only determine how easily you can accomplish what is
  possible without affecting existing systems. It cannot make you more
  creative.</p>

  <p>The problem is if you get the situation [of] people intent on
  copying your mud. Having the same mudlib makes it much easier to do
  so, even if you do not release the main town and such.</p>

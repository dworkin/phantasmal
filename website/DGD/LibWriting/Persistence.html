  <h2> Persistent MUD Libraries &mdash; Yes or No? </h2>

  <p>
    One of DGD's stated goals, and one thing that really sets it apart
    from other LP-descended MUDs, is its ability to upgrade in place.
    The idea behind this capability is to allow you to run your MUD
    full-time, never taking it down for code or data maintenance for
    longer than a few seconds.  The other ability that this enables is
    persistence &mdash; the ability to have data remain on your MUD
    forever without having to be refreshed.  Persistence in a MUD
    Library has many repercussions, some obvious and some subtle.
  </p>

  <p>
    DGD's definition of Persistence involves being able to keep actual
    LPC-language objects around, potentially forever.  The way it
    implements this goal is the State Dump.  A State Dump dumps a copy
    of all your LPC objects, whether in memory or swapped out, with
    all connections between them, to a file.  You may then, later,
    start DGD from that State Dump file and it will pick up precisely
    where it left off.  There are some things that necessarily change
    (the time, what network connections are active), but mostly this
    keeps all objects around forever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Doing this requires an <a href="ObjectManagement.html">object
    management</a> solution.  You need to be able to find old objects
    that are no longer in use and destruct them.  An object leak will
    eventually, over weeks or years, bring your MUD down because old
    leaked objects will never go away.  Rebooting no longer helps
    because all your old objects will stick around across reboots (if
    you use the State Dump, anyway).
  </p>

  <p>
    However, that curse is also a disguised blessing.  You can save a
    lot of code if you don't need to rebuild all your object
    structures when you reboot.  You no longer need to write your data
    to disk, and if you make a change in an object, it stays around
    even if you don't have a way to turn that change into a data file.
    That can be a big, big change.
  </p>

  <h3> Game Design Concerns </h3>

  <p>
    But why would any of this matter in a MUD?  In a MUD, you normally
    clean up old items to avoid inflation (well, okay, to avoid even
    <i>more</i> inflation).  You reset objects and monsters
    constantly.  When the old stuff isn't going to be kept around for
    any time anyway, why bother to make it persist for years?  Why
    would you care?
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer is that you can make a much better game with
    persistence, but only if you abandon the constant resets that
    define so much of current hack-and-slash MUD-dom.  Imagine a game
    where monsters are spawned in some more dynamic way and wander
    around more freely.  Imagine a game where a monster, when you
    killed it, were to actually <i>die</i> and not pop back up in the
    same spot a few minutes later.
  </p>

  <p>
    But wouldn't your world be entirely depopulated after a few days?
    Not if there were another way to spawn monsters.  Normally, MUD
    monsters spawn in a single location and stay there unless they're
    molested.  However, if animals were to wander randomly in from the
    far edges of the forest, if orcs were to spawn in tunnels and only
    come to the surface from there, if townsmen had to train to become
    guards rather than having guards spring fully-formed from the
    dust...  Then a few clever players, by carefully placing NPCs and
    traps, would be able to <i>change</i> the balance of the world.
    Those orcs could be beaten back and the tunnels guarded by
    powerful NPCs or players, and there would be no orcs for some time
    (until the gamemasters intervened, perhaps).  Or the orcs could be
    herded toward the forest, making it more dangerous.  There are
    many variations, and the interesting combinations would increase
    exponentially as the world grew larger and more varied.
  </p>

  <p>
    That's the concept.  It's not the only concept.  The idea of a MUD
    being able to upgrade in place so that you never have to bring it
    down has a lot of charm on its own.  There are other alluring
    possibilities that persistence allows, including simple things
    like burying a treasure in the forest and being able to dig it up
    months or years later.  And there are more complex and subtle
    issues, like being able to avoid ever writing code to save and
    load your data, which can be good, bad or both.
  </p>

  <h3> The Kernel Library and Persistence </h3>

  <p>
    There was an e-mail exchange between Frank Schmidt and Dworkin
    about the suitability of the Kernel Library as a general-use MUD
    Library.  Some of it is excerpted below.
  </p>

Your view of what a kernel library should be seems to agree perfectly
with the function of the objects in the /dgd directory tree in the
2.4.5 mudlib -- which is certainly not that of DGD's kernel library.
Beyond that, I think you also fail to understand what the kernel
library can do, as evinced by your earlier comment that it "occupies"
the auto object and driver object.  If there is one thing that the
kernel library is good at, it is modifying or completely overriding
the behaviour of those two objects.

I think that some of this blindness is caused by the extraordinary
success of LPmud 2.4.5.  To get beyond that, let's take a look at
a completely different mud, Ultima Online, comparing features with
those of traditional LPmuds:

 - UO is persistent.

   Persistence is DGD's most important single feature (I like the
   term "continuous mud" better, but "persistent mud" is the
   standard term these days).  A persistent mud needs a design
   radically different from that of a traditional LPmud:

    - There has to be a way to change the behaviour of existing
      objects.  The kernel library is designed in such a way that
      upgrading objects -- that is, recompiling them without first
      destructing them -- is possible for all objects, given the
      limitations imposed by LPC inheritance.
    - If you have guest-programmer wizards like traditional
      LPmuds, you need a way to limit the resources available to
      individual wizards, since rebooting the mud to get rid of
      undesirable objects is not an option.  The kernel library
      has a generic resource management system which manages
      such things as number of objects or number of callouts by
      default, and to which new mudlib-specific resources can be
      added at will.
    - Such functionality as string formatting should not be in the
      auto object.  Having to recompile the 3D space code because
      a change was made in string formatting is ridiculous.

 - UO has a custom client.

   The kernel library cannot make any assumptions about what sort
   of client is being used.  It cannot even assume that everyone
   uses the same client.  It merely attempts to be as little in
   the way as possible -- not only in the matter of communications.

 - UO has no traditional rooms, add_actions, etc.

   All such things have no place in the kernel library's auto object.
   Similarly, nothing that is not needed in <all> muds within its
   target range has a place in the kernel library.

 - UO supports up to 2500 players per server.

   The kernel library is prepared for DGD's multithreading future.
   Ideally, it should be possible to build a mud on top of the
   kernel library and upgrade the kernel library every time that DGD
   is changed, without letting this have an impact on your mud.

The kernel library would be a fairly good fit for implementing UO on
top of DGD.  It would not have to be changed in any way (I have
verified that this is the case).  It would have some superfluous
functionality, such as the wizard support.  On the other hand, adding
guest programmers to UO is an interesting possibility.

  <h2> Persistent MUD Libraries &mdash; Yes or No? </h2>

  <p>
    The DGD server, written by the excellent Dworkin, has changed a
    lot from its conceptual roots in LPMUD.  The language is very
    different, the server features are very different.  Its dialect of
    the LPC language is strongly based on the original LPC, and thus
    on C.  But one of the visions that has driven some of DGD's most
    powerful and unusual features is persistence.  Persistence makes a
    major difference in a MUD library, and you'll need to decide early
    on whether you want to take the effort to support it.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you <i>do</i> decide to use persistence in a DGD MUDLib, the <a
    href="../Kernel">Kernel Library</a> is worth a second look.  It
    includes extra support for a lot of the issues that persistence
    can cause your MUD.
  </p>

  <h3> DGD's Definition of Persistence </h3>

  <p>
    You'll hear the phrase 'persistent MUD' batted around a lot, and
    'persistent world' batted around even more often.  It can mean any
    of several different things.  The DGD community talks about DGD
    providing excellent support for a persistent MUD.  What do they
    mean by it?
  </p>

  <p>
    The phrases often refer to the game design.  However, DGD can't
    dictate your game design.  <a
    href="../GameDesign/GamePersistence.html">Persistent game
    design</a> is a different topic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Primarily, the DGD community means that the game runs as though it
    would never shut down, and as though the server never went down,
    even if the server <i>will</i> go down.  DGD is said to be
    persistent because the entire state of the game in memory can be
    preserved when the server is rebooted.  This allows the game to
    resume in exactly the same condition that it was in when the
    server shut down, including all internal variables of all objects.
    The game, as a single 'virtual run' of the program, never stops
    and rarely even pauses.  DGD's definition of Persistence involves
    being able to keep actual LPC-language objects around, potentially
    forever.  The object pointers never expire, you never have to save
    or restore, you never need to write code to back up your objects
    &mdash; because conceptually, the server never, never goes down.
  </p>

  <p>
    Par Winzell probably explained it best:
  </p>

  <p style="color: #2020FF">
    It's almost impossible to convey the experience of running a truly
    persistent Mud to somebody who has never done it. So many
    assumptions disappear. The way objects are created, areas
    designed, everything changes.
  </p>

  <p style="color: #2020FF">
    In traditional LPMud, virtually everything is an initialization
    script, like the create() function in your example. Half the code
    in a wizard's directory is startup code. In a persistent world,
    rather than write a lot of startup code, you tend to write
    behaviour code, and configure objects.
  </p>

  <p style="color: #2020FF">
    Most code in a traditional LPMud isn't real code, it's just a
    cumbersome configuration (set_this and set_that) technique. That
    pretty much goes away in a persistent game.
  </p>

  <p style="color: #2020FF">
    The cumulative effect is that if you design your mudlib to be
    fully persistent from scratch, you will find yourself making
    subtly different decisions on pretty much every single design
    question that comes up, and you end up with something drastically
    different than LPMud.
  </p>

  <h3> DGD Support for Persistence </h3>

  <p>
    If you're never going to shut the server down, you need the
    ability to <a href="ObjectManagement.html">upgrade your LPC
    objects in place</a>.  Eventually you'll want to add new features,
    new content, new code.  That means changing the code and data of
    existing LPC-language objects, and adding new code and data to
    them.  Since you're never going to stop your current run of the
    program, you'll want to deploy all that immediately, preferably
    without even logging your players out.  DGD allows you to do this.
  </p>

  <p>
    One way DGD simulates a single continuous run of the program is
    the <a href="../Operation/StateDumps.html">State Dump</a>.  A
    State Dump dumps a copy of all your LPC objects, whether in memory
    or swapped out, with all connections between them, to a file.  You
    may then, later, start DGD from that State Dump file and it will
    pick up precisely where it left off.  There are a (very) few
    things that necessarily change, such as the time and date, and
    what network connections are active.  But mostly, a persistent DGD
    program can keep all objects around forever.  When you restore
    from a dump, it just looks like the clock skipped, or like you
    took awhile to run the next thread of execution, and like all the
    network connections suddenly dropped.  Effectively, that's what
    just happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keeping a single run of the program going for so long requires a
    <a href="Cleanup.html">object cleanup</a> solution.  You need to
    be able to find old objects that are no longer in use and destruct
    them.  Over days, weeks or years, an object leak will eventually
    bring your MUD down because old leaked objects will never go away.
    Rebooting no longer helps because all your old objects will stick
    around across reboots.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the curse of eternal objects is also a disguised blessing.
    You can save a lot of code if you don't need to rebuild all your
    object structures when you reboot.  You no longer need to write
    your data to disk.  If you make a change in an object, it stays
    around even if you don't have a way to write that change to a data
    file.  That can be a big, big change in the way you think about
    your MUD Library.
  </p>

  <p>
    Normally, keeping all of your objects in RAM at all times would
    mean using a ridiculous amount of memory.  However, DGD is a
    disk-based server, and believes very strongly in <a
    href="../Operation/Swapping.html">swapping things to disk</a>
    constantly to save memory.  This means that if you store data as
    'in memory' LPC objects, they wind up taking no more memory or
    disk space than if you saved all your idle objects to disk.  But
    you can access LPC objects in memory instantly, and DGD will
    transparently handle all swapping.
  </p>

  <h3> Persistence and Player Bodies </h3>

  <p>
    Persistence is also related to <a href="PlayerBody.html">how you
    choose to represent the player</a> in your MUD.  Whether the
    player's body is represented by a single monolithic object or
    separated into a body and a connection object determines whether
    you can simply keep the player's body in memory when it's not
    connected.  Note that you don't have to keep the body visible
    in-game to keep the body's LPC object stored somewhere in memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    A monolithic object would contain the connection (originating IP
    address, the ability to send and receive data), but also all the
    player's information like skills, name, password, history and so
    on.  In a non-MUD application, the equivalent would be user
    preferences and settings, interface code, and any avatar the user
    might have in the program.  Separating out the connection-specific
    data (IP address, data transmission) allows you to store the
    persistent information like preferences and body data in a
    separate object, which (on a persistent server) never needs to be
    destructed, nor the settings saved to a file.  That saves
    save&frasl;load code, as do many other similar situations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Persistence also affects how equipment may be stored.  A player's
    equipment can be kept with his body, including any customizations.
    The MUD would simply move it to an unused or virtual room, if the
    body persists anyway.  Doing so is optional, of course, but it's
    another form of saving-to-file that can be avoided with a
    persistent MUD if the implementor so desires.  If your MUD permits
    object customization, this can be a way to save it long-term.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll need to periodically delete unused players if you need to
    free up space, just like you'd have to with player files.  You'll
    need to list all players and determine whether they've been idle
    so long that they need to be deleted.  That's usually easier if
    the players are stored as in-memory LPC objects rather than
    needing to be parsed from data files.
  </p>

  <h3> Upgrading Existing Objects </h3>

  <p>
    A problem with upgrading in-place is that if you change certain
    parts of how your LPC objects work, you'll be left with a lot of
    LPC data in the old layout, designed for the old code.  In a MUD
    with save and restore, it's possible to write a datafile adapter
    and kludge around this when you reboot.  The equivalent for a
    persistent MUD is an update function.
  </p>

  <p>
    To upgrade objects, you'll already need to have object management
    code to rebuild files.  Your object manager can also call upgrade
    functions on master objects easily, and those master objects can
    track and upgrade clones.  If you're using the Kernel Library,
    it's also possible to track clones by owner with the ObjRegD, or
    you can roll your own tracking system.
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case, it's sometimes necessary to write code to initialize
    new fields (such as one you just added) in old objects, or move
    data from old fields into new ones.  It's not harder than writing
    a datafile converter that does the same thing, but the results can
    be trickier if you do it wrong.  Remember, in this case you're
    updating live data and you may have players connected at the time.
    Backing up first is a useful thing, and it may be useful to start
    a secondary 'test' server from a live statedump and try your
    upgrade code there first to make sure it works.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may also find that it's useful to do an upgrade in stages.
    For instance, if you change the type and representation of a field
    in an LPC object, you may want to add the new one, put the data
    into its new location, then do a <i>second</i> LPC upgrade to
    remove the old field.
  </p>

  <h4> Example </h4>

  <p>
    For instance, I might change my objects to stop storing a
    &quot;brief description&quot; string and instead store offsets
    into my arrays of nouns and adjectives to make a description.  So
    if you see a &quot;broad green tabard&quot; then you're guaranteed
    you can &quot;look broad green tabard&quot; since it uses nouns
    and adjectives in the object.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, when I take add the new data field (let's say an array of
    integer offsets, so it'll be an int pointer), I'll need to fill in
    decent values.  I could make it default to saying the first two
    adjectives, then the first noun.  So I'd set the array to <tt>[0,
    1, 0]</tt>, where the last element is the offset into the array of
    nouns.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far, so good.  But where do I put the code to fill in all those
    fields?  One answer is &quot;in the ObjectD&quot;.  My favorite
    answer is to have the ObjectD call a function called
    &quot;upgraded&quot; if it exists on every object that gets
    upgraded.  That's what Phantasmal does.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I could put that code I mentioned above into the upgraded()
    function of my object type, then type &quot;%full_recompile&quot;
    at the command line, and my objects would all start being
    described as &quot;big brown table&quot; and &quot;flat checkered
    floor&quot; and things, all according to the first nouns and
    adjectives on their current lists.  Then I'd go fix all the descs,
    'cause that would look funny :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    But I've had to write specific upgrade code for the specific
    change I made to my objects.  In a standard MUD, I'd make the
    change to the object loading code, then shutdown the MUD and
    restart it.  Then all my objects would be appropriately altered,
    but I'd also have to drop everybody's network connection to do it,
    and generally disrupt things.  Not nearly as convenient.  Plus,
    it's slow to do all that loading and saving of LPC objects using
    LPC code.  Much faster to use a statedump.
  </p>

  <h3> Why No Load and Save? </h3>

  <p>
    If you use statedumps, there's no reason to ever move things out
    of memory, usually.  You'll need backups, but statedumps are
    (under DGD) the fastest available backups if you're writing out
    most of your MUD's data.  That saves you having to write code for
    reading and writing objects, and more importantly for large
    interconnected systems of objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may choose to have object load&frasl;save code anyway,
    probably for object import&frasl;export.  Skotos and Phantasmal
    both do this.  However, object saving is slow compared to
    statedumps, so normally object saving will only be used for export
    to a different MUD or different program.  You can also use the
    traditional save-reboot-load hack for object upgrade, just like a
    non-persistent server has to do.  That can be easier in some
    cases, at the cost of some downtime (and having to write all the
    load&frasl;save code!).  That's basically how Phantasmal uses it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Having the ability to read or write datafiles can also be a good
    means of object creation, or to import zones from other types of
    MUDs, or similar builder tricks.  Outside of your MUD, everything
    is going to move around as files, so it can be good to read and
    write them.
  </p>

  <h3> Can't This All Be Done Without DGD? </h3>

  <p>
    Certainly.  A shovel's not the only way to dig a hole - you can
    use a spoon, if you're so inclined.  You can write a large amount
    of code to save and restore huge interconnected systems of
    objects.  You can do the years (over a decade now) of testing that
    DGD has already received on those systems, and do it all for
    yourself.  None of this is impossible &mdash; DGD itself is
    written in C, so obviously a C-based system will do all of this
    just fine if it's designed correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now:  have you asked yourself why you'd ever want to?

Depends on the number of objects. In a Skotos game, clones of 
/base/obj/thing constitute > 90% of the objects in the game, and it's 
pretty pointless to keep an explicit data structure around enumerating 
180,000 objects when you can just loop 200,000 times and get them all 
anyway.

> But you still use bigmaps to store the actual clones, right?

Nope. There's no point... for this particular problem, and for clonables 
whose clones constitute a significant portion of the objects in the 
game, find_object() happens to be all you need.

> So as I understand it, the iterator is just a way of retrieving the 
> contents of the datastructure?

Yes, although the emphasis should be on it being THE way; i.e. once you 
start using them, you quickly start taking it for granted that wherever 
there is a data structure, you can fetch its iterator. I can communicate 
these facts but I can't communicate fully the experience. These OO 
concepts seem to solve nothing new, but they change everything.

Again this is one of those things you don't fully understand until you 
have had to administer a persistent game. Once you boot DGD into a game 
that uses state dumps, you will never ever again cold start it. That 
means every persistent resource (i.e. rooted in a persistent object) you 
create will still be with you in the year 2350 unless you have, on th 
very first day of your uptime, administrative code in place that keeps 
track of these objects.

If you have a guest programmer who just executes,

   clone_object("/foo");

without doing something with the return value, and you don't have code 
at a low level that registers this clone somewhere, this clone is more 
or less gone forever. It is never garbage collected (it is not a LWO) 
and nobody has a pointer to it. The only way it can be found is by using 
find_object(), and for that you have to know the path name.

Once you realize what a potentially huge and dark haystack an eternal 
uptime is, and how little of a safetynet there is unless you write one 
yourself, you will see the reason why people here rail against the idea 
of rewriting the kernel library from scratch. There should be a layer of 
code in place on top of DGD and below your mudlib that has been tested 
by dozens of people before you, with all the bugs ironed out, that you 
can rely on with absolute certainty. From the perspective of the mudlib 
writer, such administrative code should be considered more or less part 
of the driver. This discipline is essential.

> Also, as people left me with the impression that they don't often recall

It's there for the same reason you keep 10 gallons of water in your 
basement for when the earthquake hits, yet you don't amble down there to 
refill your glass during dinner.

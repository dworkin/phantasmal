That's my candidate for best paragraph of the year in the list. Maybe 
because it hits so close to home; I know I'm guilty of reimplementation. Of 
course I don't think I ever would have *really* understood things like stack 
security, natural language parsing or the intermud3 protocol if I hadn't 
rebuilt them from scratch. Nevertheless, I didn't make other advancements 
that could have moved things forward - a shame I guess but it is what it is.

That's the biggest problem in the MUD development community 
today.  Thousands (dare I say millions?) of man hours have gone towards 
developing libs, but no-one ever wants to release them (some for the reason 
you stated, and thousands of other reasons as well).

We have to keep re-inventing the wheel, over and over again.  How much 
code, I wonder, will never see the light of day again?

This falls into "one of the other reasons people don't release code".

I think back on the Linux addage of, "Release early.  Release 
often."  Maybe we should adopt this.

I don't think anyone suggested that.

And yet another mudlib is born, when there are several mudlibs that need to 
be completed.

And perhaps not so interesting to hear from folks who haven't released 
anything at all.

I concur, and I think that this would be a worthwhile project
(albeit for someone with fewer kids than me ;) even with SkotOS
coming out for public access.

As someone who's been directly involved in coding two mudlibs
that have been publicly released, and tangentially involved in
a couple more that have and several more than haven't: No project
of this sort succeeds if more than three people are involved.
Either two or three is ideal; you need someone else around to
keep you moving forward. Two is more streamlined and harder for
one person to slack off, but two people can have tie votes and
three can't.

It helps if people are clearly divided by tasks going into
the project. For something like this, one person for low-level
coding, one for game world coding, one for "artsy-fartsy" might
be the right division. Given the needs of DGD, the artsy-fartsy
contribution would probably actually be the most important.

I'm not going to stop coding; in fact, I've just realized that what the DGD 
community needs more than anything else are finished products.  I know that 
your message here has advocated against the use of "stock" libs...

BUT, from what you've said, and my own observations, it is imperative for 
us, for both the sake of DGD and MUD'ing in general, to produce the following;

1)  We have a great driver already...
2)  We need OLC creation tools, to inspire non-coders to become builders...
3)  We need tools to link the web browser to the MUD, so that getting into 
the MUD can be seamless for the novice...
4)  We need a stock lib with enough playable content so that the average 
guy will be inspired to set up a MUD in the first place...
5)  We need it now.

All of the great MUDs that are out there, after a closer inspection, are 
MUDs that have been around for a while (with only a few exceptions).   They 
have had the hordes of builders pass through them, to create the massive 
amount of content that is necessary to grab and keep players.  The cycle is 
a vicious one; and the only way to break it is to create a massive amount 
of content to draw players in the first place.

But, most libs "die on the vine" because they undertake the massive 
project, only to become dis-interested once the size of the project 
overwhelms them (I suffered from this as well).

I think the original idea for the 2.4.5 lib is a valid model for today; 
players play until they exhaust the content, and once they do, they are 
then in charge of creating new content.

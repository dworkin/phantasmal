Subject: [DGD] Question: Implementing foreach()

[...]

So if a sane foreach design relies on specific mudlib classes, then
obviously the foreach implementation itself should be in the mudlib. To
do this, as Noah says, means you take over compile_object() and do your
own pass over the source code before you hand it over to DGD's compiler.
At that point you could (if you still cared enough) expand e.g.

  foreach (item : player->query_inventory()) {
      item->explode();
  }

to something like

  {
    object "/lib/iterator" __tmpiter345;
    __tmpiter345 = player->query_inventory()->get_safe_iterator();
    while (__tmpiter345->has_more()) {
      item = __tmpiter345->get_next();
      item->explode();
    }
  }


My personal opinion is increasingly that it's better to resist the lure
of syntactic sugar. Verbose code is not necessarily less readable, and
once you start modifying LPC, it's incredibly hard to resist bloating
the language.

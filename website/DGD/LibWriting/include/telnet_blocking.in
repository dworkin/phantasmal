In recent versions of DGD the 'telnet_port' entry in the configuration
file can be an integer or a mapping and as far as I remember you
should be able to make that an empty mapping, causing no telnet ports
to be opened at all.

>From the 1.2.72 Changelog diff:

+  - Config file change.  ({ 6047, 6048 }) for ports changed to a mapping in
+    which the address must also be specified: ([ "*":6047, "localhost":6048 ])

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

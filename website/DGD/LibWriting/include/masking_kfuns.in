Yes.  In your auto-object, you can do something like this:

    static object find_object(string path)
    {
        /* Do some of your own sanitizing of input, etc. */

        /* ... */
        
        return ::find_object(path);
    }

If you redefine the function in the auto-object, then only code in the
auto-object can use ::function() to access the original.  And of
course the driver-object can, assuming you don't do bizarre things
like inheriting the auto-object, there.

Cheers,

Erwin.

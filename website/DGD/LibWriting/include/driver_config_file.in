The driver-object itself also needs to be compiled and for that DGD
needs to know what the standard include file, the include-directories
and the create function are (quite often you don't use it, but it _is_
possible to do something useful in there).

If you have a look at the driver-functions that DGD already supports
you'll see that you can do just about all of the above in LPC already
by adding some extra code in the driver object and the alternate
create function could be done by some special code in the auto object.

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

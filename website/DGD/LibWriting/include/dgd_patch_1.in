Subject: [DGD] 1.2.71

What I forgot to mention: the 1.2.71 patch includes a change to the
driver object in the kernel library.  To upgrade this object to the
new version in a persistent mud, you have to recompile it and then
immediately reboot the mud.

The upgrade to the auto object is safe and can be performed at any
time.

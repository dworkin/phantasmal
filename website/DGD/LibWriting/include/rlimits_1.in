50 ticks remaining.

The inner ticks don't count for the outer rlimits.  However, the mudlib
has some say in this, since each use of rlimits() is checked at compile
time and possibly also at runtime.  The kernel library doesn't allow
increasing the resource limits beyond what they currently are, <unless>
the current object is a System object.

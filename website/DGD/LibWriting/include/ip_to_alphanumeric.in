Three options:

1. Your machine doesn't have name-resolving configured properly.
2. The query_ip_name() kfun is redefined by something that doesn't work.
3. Perhaps the ipnumber doesn't resolve correctly.

The example ipnumber you gave resolves just fine though, so 1 & 2 are
the only reason I would put any money on right now.

Good luck figuring it out. :-)

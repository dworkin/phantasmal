This is the same as what the original poster tried with the 'return
nil;', except you're running with a different strict-typing mode.
It'll cause an intentional coredump as s/he showed.

You can currently provide an array of port-numbers.  It's on the todo
list to make it possible to put an empty array there and have no
binary (or telnet) ports open at all.

For now, create a dummy object that self-destructs as soon as it has
been created, so you can clone one of those and return it in
binary_connect() instead of nil or 0.

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

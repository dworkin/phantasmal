To summarize what's already been said and add some of my own --

The DGD driver has 'telnet' ports and 'binary' ports. The telnet ports 
have an implementation of the Telnet protocol inside DGD itself. I'd 
probably argue a modern mudlib should implement this on the mudlib 
level, but it's convenient to have it in DGD, especially because it's 
such a confusing protocol with so many broken implementations out in the 
wild. The ANSI patch to DGD, as far as I can remember, just removes a 
few lines of code in DGD that explicitly strips escape sequences such as 
ANSI colour codes.

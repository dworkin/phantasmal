Subject: [DGD] ANSI Patch for DGD 1.2.87

I decided to update the ansi patch, no reason why other than I was fiddling 
with various stuff which broke dgd badly and got tired of hand editing files 
after the fifth time I had to repatch from .85 up. 

The patch is now 1 file long and should patch in exactly like the 
experimental patches do (patch -p 0 < patchname) so long as you put it in 
the same directory.  It explains that in the top of the patch and all of the 
old files that were included in the older ansi patch are now included in 
this one and created in the dgd/doc/ansi directory. 

You can download it at:

It's no better than the old patch it just applies cleanly with the patch 
command instead of requiring hand editing.  So if you've already patched 
THIS DOES NOTHING DIFFERENT LEAVE IT BE! :)  I've not tested it with the net 
patch or epp or any other patches, just vanilla 1.2.87. 

Anywho,

You don't _inherit_ things into the auto object, you'll have to
#include them into it.  But yes, if you do that, you will be able to
use it whenever.

Now, personally I'd consider that really bad form and would prefer to
have something like /lib/sprintf.c available for the objects that
actually _need_ it.  But maybe that's just me, I like to keep the
auto-object(s) lean and mean, makes it less likely that security or
consistency bugs creep in.

Oh, and your reminder of the day:

Thanks in advance,

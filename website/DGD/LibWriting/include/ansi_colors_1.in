Subject: [DGD] ansi colours

Assuming you're just talking about ANSI escape sequences in general and 
not a DGD-specific thing, I have a list of the ansi escape sequences on 
my web-site.  It's not wildly accurate (in terms of which sequences came 
from which specific standards), but it's what I used for the muds I've 
worked on and my mud client.

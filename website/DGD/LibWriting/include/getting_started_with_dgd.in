The idea is that DGD focuses on doing the driver part right, and the 
things you'd consider essential to writing a mudlib -- like a string 
search function -- belong in a middle layer. If you chose to reject the 
existing middle layers, as many do, you also forfeit the right to say 
that DGD is too minimalistic.

All three bears are examples of how a kernel (or System) level library 
could choose to implement a user-friendly function. A mudlib developer 
should not need to meet the bears in person.

Well, the term 'proprietary' is a little misleading, since by and large 
everybody who writes something for DGD publishes it to the world...

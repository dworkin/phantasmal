It's because you are using a Mac.  DGD uses line mode for telnet clients,
and binary mode is not well-defined for line mode in the telnet protocol.
DGD uses a hack to enable it on many clients, but apparently it fails on
the Mac.

I am not planning any changes in DGD's telnet support, since even minor
changes are bound to break clients on some other platform.  Instead I am
thinking about a standard protocol for a new mud client, a version of
which I will probably release in Java.  Oh, and it will connect to the
binary port, with the protocol level on the server side handled by LPC.

As Noah said, both have advantages, and it is about even. It depends
mostly on what you're used to. I like /cmd because I'm used to it,
but also because when commands go through master objects rather
than wiztool clones, it's a little easier to update one command
at a time. Also, if you're like me and you make a lot of errors,
then it might be better to have only one command go casters-up
when you screw up than to break the wiztool. Security can be a
little chancy with command bins because commands like "delete"
and "nuke" typically have fairly high privilege levels and you
have to protect them against inappropiate calls. Wiztools have
the same problem in concept but becaue each wiztool is associated
with one wizards (assuing you do it that way) it's a bit easier
to protect them. Or so I'm told - I haven't used wiztools.

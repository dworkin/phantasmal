Subject: [DGD] ansi colours

These might be of some use to you, when using the escape \033 sequence in
files the editors or mor'ing interprets the colours and not the codes so
You can't see the codes used like that in a file, these are visible as
colours in the mud as well as being editable:

"\x1B[0m"
"\x1B[1m"
"\x1B[31m"
"\x1B[32m"
"\x1B[33m"
"\x1B[34m"
"\x1B[35m"
"\x1B[36m"
"\x1B[37m"
"\x1B[41m"
"\x1B[42m"
"\x1B[43m"
"\x1B[44m"
"\x1B[45m"
"\x1B[46m"
"\x1B[47m"

Also of note, if you enable ansi in DGD, you should consider stripping escape
sequences in a user's issued command. Else they can change colour on other's
screen by just sending a 'realescape'<colorcode>. I imagine other strange
things are possible if you don't strip escape sequences. 

Did this in my old modified melville:
	result = strlen(str);
	for (i=0; i < result; i++)
	{
		if (str[i] < 32) { str[i] = ' '; }
	}

Happy Colouring!

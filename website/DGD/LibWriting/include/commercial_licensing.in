Well, I think this problem could be solved quite nicely.
Let's say you build a world and place all images required in the players
client.
When a new built area is access by a player, the server asks the client if
that area's images is availible on the players local hard drive.
If not, they are downloaded to the client while the player sees a
"Loading"-screen.
The same goes for weapons, new monsters around the world too. The server can
easily just ask the
client if the required images are already downloaded, if not a download
procedur is started.

I think my solution will be much more appreciated amongst players than the
solution where they have to manually update their clients.

If you know how your kernel's user/connection handling is working then
you should have little trouble getting this to work on your kernel.

It will be available for non-commercial use once I cleaned it up a bit and
have a little bit more documentation for interfacing with it (which should
take some 2 weeks due to me being away from home for a while)

As a sidenote, there is also a project at
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/dgd-httpd/ which provides a (for what
I can tell more heavyweight) http server for DGD. If you need things like
XML parsing or webdav, take a look at that as well. What I have written is
extremely minimalistic in comparison.

Bart.

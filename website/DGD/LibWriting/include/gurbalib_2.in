I concur, and I think that this would be a worthwhile project
(albeit for someone with fewer kids than me ;) even with SkotOS
coming out for public access.

As someone who's been directly involved in coding two mudlibs
that have been publicly released, and tangentially involved in
a couple more that have and several more than haven't: No project
of this sort succeeds if more than three people are involved.
Either two or three is ideal; you need someone else around to
keep you moving forward. Two is more streamlined and harder for
one person to slack off, but two people can have tie votes and
three can't.

It helps if people are clearly divided by tasks going into
the project. For something like this, one person for low-level
coding, one for game world coding, one for "artsy-fartsy" might
be the right division. Given the needs of DGD, the artsy-fartsy
contribution would probably actually be the most important.

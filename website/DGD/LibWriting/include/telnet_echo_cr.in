DGD always sends \r\n as a newline on telnet connections.  But it does
not respond to some of the more advanced settings that putty may be
attempting.  Your options are to modify dgd/src/comm.c to more fully
implement telnet option negotiation, to change putty settings instead
of DGD/LPC code, or to connect to the binary port.

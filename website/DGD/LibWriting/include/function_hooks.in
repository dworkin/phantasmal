Are you talking about the functions that DGD expects in the driver
object, or about the hooks that the kernel-lib provides?

The driver object is expected to provide certain functions, even if
those functions do (almost) nothing and are just placeholders.

The kernel-lib can be started without any modifications and you can
take it from there.

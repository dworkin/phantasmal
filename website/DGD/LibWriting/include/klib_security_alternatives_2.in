There's a Linux kernel module called davfs2 which allows you to
mount WebDAV filesystems:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/dav/

so it's portable enough to run on your developers' three most
likely choices of operating system.  There also seems to be a
command-line client called cadaver which can up/download files.
Mounting a WebDAV filesystem is easy on a Mac, presumably also
in Windows, don't know about Linux.

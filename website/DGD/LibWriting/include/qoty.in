That's my candidate for best paragraph of the year in the list. Maybe 
because it hits so close to home; I know I'm guilty of reimplementation. Of 
course I don't think I ever would have *really* understood things like stack 
security, natural language parsing or the intermud3 protocol if I hadn't 
rebuilt them from scratch. Nevertheless, I didn't make other advancements 
that could have moved things forward - a shame I guess but it is what it is.

That's the biggest problem in the MUD development community 
today.  Thousands (dare I say millions?) of man hours have gone towards 
developing libs, but no-one ever wants to release them (some for the reason 
you stated, and thousands of other reasons as well).

We have to keep re-inventing the wheel, over and over again.  How much 
code, I wonder, will never see the light of day again?

This falls into "one of the other reasons people don't release code".

I think back on the Linux addage of, "Release early.  Release 
often."  Maybe we should adopt this.

I don't think anyone suggested that.

And yet another mudlib is born, when there are several mudlibs that need to 
be completed.

And perhaps not so interesting to hear from folks who haven't released 
anything at all.

Subject: [DGD] Cancelling input_to()

In user.c of the Melville lib there should be a variable for the input 
object and input function (even if you don't use the lib, it should be 
the basic idea) :

object input_obj;	/* object for input_to */
static string input_func; /* function for input_to */

If you can place a function in the user object that clears the object, 
you can safely get out of the input_to (Look at receive_message() ).
Then just call the function in whatever object you want. You might want 
to place security restrictions on this function since it can adversely 
effect things if you rely heavily on input_to's.  And yes, it seems 
possible to do it with a time_out function, but I've never tried it, 
nor the answer given above.
However, I haven't tested this, so I can't be sure.

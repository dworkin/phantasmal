   - Make sure that a callout handle is not truncated to 16 bits before an
     attempt is made to remove it.
   - Include system files before DGD files on Windows.
+  - Rather than causing an error, let the callout and precompiled object lists
+    returned by status() be nil if they would not fit in an array.

This patch includes the promised changes to the kernel library.  It
also simplifies upgrading a persistent mud from kernel library version
1.2.21 (included with DGD 1.2.71); rebooting immediately after the
driver object is recompiled is no longer necessary.

Dworkin

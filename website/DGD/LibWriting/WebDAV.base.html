I would humbly suggest that, if you're going to build a file-serving 
protocol in LPC, that you at least consider WebDAV. Windows and OSX 
speak it natively, there are lots of separate clients available for 
just about every platform, and the HTTP server that you would have to 
build first (WebDAV is an extension of HTTP) would just be generally 
useful anyway. What's more, just about every development environment 
has some understanding of HTTP (and many do WebDAV), so anything you 
develop in the future probably would need no separate protocol to 
interact with the MUD.

There's a Linux kernel module called davfs2 which allows you to
mount WebDAV filesystems:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/dav/

so it's portable enough to run on your developers' three most
likely choices of operating system.  There also seems to be a
command-line client called cadaver which can up/download files.
Mounting a WebDAV filesystem is easy on a Mac, presumably also
in Windows, don't know about Linux.

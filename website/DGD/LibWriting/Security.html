  <h2> Miscellaneous Issues in MUD Security </h2>

  <p>
    Have a set of core objects that define basic behaviour and
    limitations which cannot be rewritten from within the mud, not
    even by the mud administrator.  The Kernel Library puts these in
    the &frasl;kernel directory.  This is to enforce security limits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Never keep the config file (the one ending in .dgd) inside the MUD
    code tree.  It could be overwritten and used to give an attacker
    access to files outside the mudlib, such as the password file on
    the host system.  Changing it can also allow your MUD to
    masquerade as a different service, and potentially open different
    incoming ports.  If you're using the network package, it can
    easily cause your MUD to be usable as a relay or a zombie for a
    distributed attack on other systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't put the swapfile in the mudlib directory, either, since
    information which is otherwise hidden inside objects will be
    readable from it.

That's a feature :)

That's correct. The real flaw is that the MudOS UID system does
not distinguish between Bob, the user object, and any files in
Bob's directory. Bob, as a user, has to have write access to
sensitive places, but there's no reason why every object in his
directory has to have it also.

The solution, which Melville adopts, is to give Bob's user
object one UID, and the objects in his directory another.
Objects in wizard directories come pretty much without
permissions. Objects can get permissions only if they are
located in special directories (/cmds, most prominently)
to which only Bob has write access.

Of course, the system collapses if Bob gives away write access
to /cmds to you, but hopefully Bob will realize that doing
that is folly.

This leads to a broader point, which is that inexperienced
or clueless admins doing things they don't understand are
a much bigger threat to security than crackers are. Given
that MUDs are almost invariably run by amateurs, if you
want to make a MUD security system safe, keeping it simple
to operate and robust to novice errors is very important.

This will place some restrictions on directory structure.
Think about where you will store player save files (assuming
your mudlib is not so persistent that you have abandoned
player save files). If you have an in-mud mail system, think
about where you will put the mail spools. Objects like the
mail reader, which have unique permissions (the mail reader
can read /data/mail but not /data/anything_else) will need
to be in directories by themselves. I think problems of this
form are all solvable as long as you're willing to accept
the limits on directory structure they imply.

But in general, I think the important thing for anyone looking
to improve on UID based security is to make a sharp distinction
between a user and his files, which MudOS (or TMI, depending
on how you want to apportion the blame ;) didn't make.

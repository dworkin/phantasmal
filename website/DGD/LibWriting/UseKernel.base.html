@@TITLE Using the Kernel@@

<h2>Should You Use the Kernel Library for Your New MUD Library?</h2>

<p>DGD comes with a little library called the Kernel Library. It's not a
game, or even a particularly good chat server. Most of what it does is
infrastructure, stuff that may not be obvious when you look at what it
does. So: what does it do for you? Why would you use it? Why wouldn't
you use it?</p>

<h3>What Does It Provide?</h3>

<p>The Kernel Library builds on top of DGD. And any game that can be
built on top of DGD can be built on top of the Kernel Library, though it
may require some funny contortions to make some of them work. However,
some kinds of <i>code</i> that would otherwise work in DGD won't work
with the Kernel Library. It's just that there's always a way to replace
that code (in a game) with something else that works. It's a little like
saying that you can do anything in the C programming language without
"goto". It may take some re-structuring, but you can do it. And like
"goto", most of the things the Kernel Library restricts are things you
probably shouldn't use.</p>

<p>So other than being strict with you, what does the Kernel Library do
for you? Mainly, it provides upgradeability, security, and resource
management. For details, read about <a href=
"../Kernel/ScopeOfLib.html">the scope of the Kernel Library</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about building on top of the Kernel Library, see
the <a href="../Kernel">Getting Started with the Kernel Library</a>
section of this site.</p>

<h3>Why Would You Use It?</h3>

<p>The Kernel Library provides a standard base for building. If DGD
changes, the Kernel Library can help shield you. For instance, when the
behavior of send_message changed several years ago, the Kernel Library
changed its behavior so that all Kernel-based MUD Libraries still worked
on new versions. The Kernel's abstraction layer can stay standard, even
across different versions of DGD.</p>

<p>The Kernel provides some future-compatibility &mdash; it uses
thread-local storage in several places that you might not know to, so
every Kernel-based MUD Library is more likely to work well with the
upcoming multiprocessor version of DGD. You'll still need to fine-tune,
but the Kernel gives the basics for free.</p>

<p>By keeping your programming on the straight and narrow, the Kernel
library is also handling needs you don't (yet) know you have. For
instance, you may not need to upgrade your objects initially, but if you
use the Kernel then you can be certain that if that need comes up, you
can meet it. Similarly, you may initially have only a single
administrator on your MUD. If you then need to add a second or third
administrator, the Kernel's built-in security makes it much easier to
keep them from intentionally or negligently causing problems. Since the
Kernel Library was designed with very large projects in mind, and has
been used in very complex projects, you can be sure that it's suitable
for them. Your own homebrew solution may require more work to fix the
same problems.</p>

<p>The Kernel provides a base for various modules and upgrades. If you
start with it, you have several Object Daemons to choose from, and they
should require little or no modification. Phantasmal recently added an
SSH daemon that had been written for the Kernel Library, and it required
only about an hour of effort to get it working... Phantasmal is
Kernel-based, so the upgrade worked immediately and used Phantasmal's
game code and user objects without a hitch.</p>

<h3>Why Wouldn't You Use It</h3>

<p>Some people prefer to write their own code, just in general. That's
usually a very, very poor reason to avoid the Kernel Library &mdash; it
solves many subtle problems, and you really need to understand them
thoroughly if you don't use the Kernel. Thread-local storage, object
upgrading, information being passed insecurely through the call-stack...
These are all topics that need to be addressed, but for which there is
no good documentation. The Kernel solves each of them, and many
more.</p>

<p>A more common reason to avoid it is that it seems too complex. The
Kernel Library seems to give very little until you understand it well,
and there's definitely a lot of code there. However, as this page should
demonstrate, the Kernel Library addresses a lot of different concerns,
and it does so quite well. It's complicated, but usually only because it
has to be complicated. If there's something you're not concerned with
that the Kernel Library does (like security, say), you're probably
better off tearing the security-related code out of the Kernel Library
and using the result than writing your own replacement... The Kernel
does a ridiculous variety of stuff, and it will be very hard for you to
make sure you do all the same things.</p>

<p>Another common complaint is that the layout is unfamiliar. The Kernel
Library has an unusual security model based on objects checking what
program is calling them. It handles significant security and data
integrity issues by checking the pathname of the program, so moving a
piece of code from one directory to another (or calling it from a
different function or object) can significantly change the behavior. The
security model can be both powerful and elegant once you understand it,
but it requires significant effort to understand. This is a significant
issue &mdash; requiring MUD Library authors to understand unfamiliar
code has held DGD back for years, and it's hard to find builders and
coders who already know LPC, let alone DGD's Kernel Library. However,
the only solution to the issue is to turn your MUD into yet another
LPMUD clone. If you're doing something new and innovative, you're going
to have to work with some unfamiliar code, and so are your builders. If
you're <i>not</i> doing something new and innovative, why are you
bothering to write your own MUD Library?</p>

<h3>The Kernel Library and Persistence</h3>

<p>There was an e-mail exchange between Frank Schmidt and Dworkin about
the suitability of the Kernel Library as a general-use MUD Library. Some
of it is excerpted below.</p>

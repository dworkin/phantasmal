  <h2> Using rlimits() in your Library </h2>

  <p>
    The rlimits() DGD construct can be used to keep your MUD running
    despite infinite loops and infinite recursions in code.  In
    combination with status(), it can be used for profiling your code
    and keeping track of how much processor time each wizard, or each
    function, is taking up.  If you're not using the Kernel Library,
    you need to understand rlimits() intimately to avoid infinite
    recursions and loops.  If you <i>are</i> using the Kernel Library,
    it can still be useful here and there.
  </p>

  <p>
    It turns out that rlimits() isn't actually a function, which is
    why it can have the odd syntax it does.  Specifically, it gets
    used this way:
  </p>

  <pre>
rlimits(-1;-1) {
  &frasl;* Some code goes here *&frasl;
}
  </pre>

  <p>
    Rlimits has two parameters, both set to -1 above.  The first is
    the limit on the stack depth, the second is the limit on the tick
    count.  If the code inside the curly braces exceeds either limit,
    an error occurs.  When either limit is -1, that means unlimited
    &mdash; no limit to stack depth, or no limit to tick count.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stack depth is a measure of how many functions are active at
    once.  Functions call each other, and those call other functions,
    to greater and greater depth, and more data is allocated.  As that
    happens, the stack depth gets closer and closer to the limit.
    This prevents an infinite (or just very deep) recursion inside the
    rlimits() statement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ticks are a processor-independent measurement of how much time the
    code is likely to take.  Felix calls them &quot;a weighted measure
    of the number of instructions and the size of the datastructures
    manipulated by these instructions&quot;.  Since DGD focuses
    strongly on compatibility, it's important that the measurement be
    cross-platform.  Each operation in DGD takes a number of ticks,
    depending on what the operation is, and what data it is operating
    on.  Some operations, like 32-bit integer addition, will always
    take the same number of ticks.  Some operations, like
    parse_string(), will take a widely-varying number of ticks,
    depending on what the inputs to that operation are.
  </p>

  <p>
    The status() call returns an array of interesting information.
    One offset within this array is to the current tick count, which
    increases over time as operations occur.  This can be used to
    determine how close to the tick limit your code is, and to profile
    code or 'bill' different operations for the number of ticks they
    use up.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use of rlimits() is to prevent infinite recursions or infinite
    loops in suspect code &mdash; code that you're not entirely sure
    will return in a reasonable amount of time, or at all.  Any
    operation based on player data, for instance, is likely to be in
    this category since somebody might want to bring your MUD to a
    halt with a complicated operation.  Your library may want to limit
    its <i>own</i> actions as well, so that faulty code on your part
    is less likely to crash the entire game.
  </p>

  <p>
    To be <i>really</i> certain, just set up an rlimits() call from
    every place that DGD calls into your code.  That means the driver
    object and the user object, several calls in each.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good places to set rlimits() include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>call_out calls (when they start executing, not when they're
      scheduled)</li>
    <li>compile_error(), runtime_error() in DRIVER object </li>
    <li>&lt;create&gt;() functions</li>
    <li>receive_message() in USER object</li>
    <li>open(), close() in USER object</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You should also be careful to specifically limit any user-supplied
    code or builder-supplied code.  If you have room scripts or other
    (relatively) inessential code, don't be shy about putting an
    rlimits() around it with a more restrictive set of limits.  That
    keeps such code from burning through too many of your ticks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rlimits often goes well with a catch() statement so that if the
    code runs too long or recurses too deep, you can log a more
    meaningful error about exactly what code caused the problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll want to make sure that an rlimits() <i>inside</i> the one
    you put in place can't override you.  Somebody can put an
    rlimits(-1;-1) somewhere inside the code you limited, and then the
    error won't be caused if they go into an infinite loop.  Luckily,
    DGD will query your DRIVER object every time somebody attempts an
    rlimits() statement, so you'll need to make sure your rlimits()
    statement works (to limit them) and their doesn't work when they
    try to override you.  See the Kernel Library for good examples of
    how to use rlimits(), including not letting the code you call
    override your limits.  The MudOSalike package, by Frank Schmidt,
    is also a good example of rlimits().
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a bit of a tutorial, this one by Erwin Harte:
  </p>

  <pre>
To make sure a function started by a call_out() is wrapped inside such
an rlimits construct, you would have to redefine call_out() in your
auto-object, like this:

    static int
    call_out(string func, int delay, mixed args...)
    {
        return ::call_out("_F_call_out", delay, func, args);
    }

    nomask void
    _F_call_out(string func, mixed *args)
    {
        if (previous_program()) {
	    rlimits (MAX_STACK; MAX_TICKS) {
		call_other(this_object(), func, args...);
	    }
        }
    }

The 'if (previous_program()) {' condition is to make sure the function
cannot be abused by calling it directly, this way it will only call
the given function with the parameters if it's the start of a thread.

If you're thinking of making _F_call_out() a static function, think
again, because that would make it an 'efun' since it's in the auto-
object, and then you cannot call it from a call_out(). :-)

When error recovery is essential, there are two things you can do.

1. You can make sure that something happens using rlimits:

    rlimits (0; -1) {
	catch {
	    call_limited("foo");
	} : {
	    /*
	     * this MUST complete to fully recover from an error
	     */
	    bar();
	}
    }

   There are several problems with this approach.  First, when using
   the kernel library, only System objects can use rlimits (...; -1).
   Second, an infinite loop in bar() will hang your mud forever.
   Third, even though foo() is called with limits appropriate for the
   current object, those limits are reset for the call, thanks to the
   enclosing rlimits (..; -1).  Fourth, the ticks spent in bar() will
   not be accounted for using the kernel library's resource management
   system.

2. You can make sure that nothing happened, using atomic functions:

    atomic void foo()
    {
	/*
	 * an error inside this function will undo all the actions
	 * performed inside this function
	 */
    }

   Atomic functions can be used by anyone.  They have two drawbacks:
   first, you cannot do file-changing actions inside them.  Second,
   they take twice the amount of ticks that would ordinarily be
   spent in that function.  Therefore, it makes sense to keep the
   actions performed in these functions to a minimum.

   However, since the actual time spent inside atomic functions is
   usually far less than twice that of an equivalent non-atomic
   function, an alternative would be to take that overhead for granted,
   double all tick quotas, and use atomic functions all through your
   mudlib.  The latter approach was taken by Skotos.  Practically
   everything in a Skotos mud is performed atomically.

Pick whichever solution suits you best.

Dworkin

50 ticks remaining.

The inner ticks don't count for the outer rlimits.  However, the mudlib
has some say in this, since each use of rlimits() is checked at compile
time and possibly also at runtime.  The kernel library doesn't allow
increasing the resource limits beyond what they currently are, <unless>
the current object is a System object.

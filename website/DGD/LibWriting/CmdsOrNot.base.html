  <titledef text="&frasl;cmd vs wiztool" />

  <h2> Should Your MUD Library Use &frasl;cmd or a Wiztool? </h2>

  <p>
    There are two common ways of adding commands to DGD programs.  One
    is to have a directory of objects, traditionally called
    &frasl;cmd, and add text commands to it by adding LPC files, each
    with the same name as the command they will implement.  The other
    is to have a single object, often called a Wiztool, which takes
    the input and executes an appropriate command based on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are also a few hybrid approaches, such as the Skotos
    verb&frasl;action approach.  Each action has an associated grammar
    in Skotos' parser, which resolves to a structure like <tt>[
    &quot;attack&quot;, &lt;Bobo#7&gt;, &lt;sword#317&gt; ]</tt>.
    There, each action would presumably have a &frasl;cmd-style LPC
    object to execute the action.  However, the verbs add to a single
    central grammar, which parses and dispatches them wiztool-style.

Pretty much.
There some tiny differences (like the error messages will point you to the correct
line in the ".h" file), but the don't really effect the outcome of your question.


>When you inherit a file does it do the same thing?

No.
You don't technically inherit a file.
You inherit a program.
The program is defined by a file containing LPC code, but
   inherit "/usr/darkcide/frobnaz" ;
doesn't actually mean to inherit the file, it means to inherit the program that
is produced by compiling that file.

No.

Yes (more or less)

Not quite.
If tools.c contains lost of variables, then they are copied, because each object
needs its own copy of the variable, but the code is not copied.
It's much like using clone_object(), each time you clone it, you recreate the
variables, but there's only 1 copy of the code.

>tools.c?

Possibly, but that's a design question that relates to the way your mudlib will
operate.
You probably don't need to worry from an efficiency point of view.

Good point. I guess the main thing is that it's easier
to maintain commands if each one is in a separate file
that doesn't do anything else. I was kinda struck by the
length of receive_message in the kernel's user; it's
quite long because the basic commands (say, tell, passwd,
users, that sort of thing) are hard-coded in user.c.
If you want to change the tell command, and you make
a mistake and the file won't load, with the /cmds
system, all that breaks is the tell command. With
the kernel system, user.c would stop compiling. Similarly
with the wiztool, although if you had a clone of the
old wiztool already, nothing bad would happen as long
as no one tried to clone a new wiztool.

There are also some parsing advantages to knowing that
the code for the foo command can be found in /cmds/foo.c,
although not much, and of course there are parsing advantages
to knowing that commands are found only in the wiztool also.

I agree that command objects should not be instantiated.
In DGD it's not hard to prevent that, although Melville
does not bother.

> The 'most mudlibs'
> statement you make is, I think, both wrong and irrelevant...

Perhaps so. I should perhaps have said LPMud mudlibs and
variants, as I don't know much about other types. Within
that group, LP 3.x, TMI-2, Nightmare, and Melville use the
command file system, LP 2.4.5 and the kernel lib use the
wiztool system (IIRC - haven't used any of them except
the kernel and Melville for years). That's not a complete
list of those mudlibs either but it's the only ones I am
even passingly familiar with. Do mudlibs from a broader
category tend to use other systems? I am sure there are
more than two ways to solve the problem.

Nothing particularly much. The advantages, as I see it, are
being able to access it as a separate file, and are primarily
organizational. The system of having each command in its
own file, but then be inherited into user.c, would also
derive most of the benefits, except for the handling of
a failed compile.

Recompiling without first destructing has been a feature in DGD
for 4 years now. :-)

Many things in the kernel lib are the way they are for the sake
of simplicity and efficiency.  Also, the kernel library is not
intended to be changed, but rather to be extended, so I can
reasonably assume that the only person who changes the code is
myself; and I have no problems at all with maintaining 26
commands in the same file.

There is a peculiarity in the /cmds model which I was anxious to
avoid: the commands are not just in separate files, but they are
even in separate instantiated <objects>.  This has led to a near-
endless stream of security problems.

Quite so, but you've missed the point of my argument: the problem is
not one versus many command objects, but that these command objects
are <shared> between all players.  Shared command objects indeed
require a high access level.  They may have this always, or they
may acquire a specific player's privileges for each command; each
of these methods has its problems.

In the kernel library, each player with wizard-level access has his
or her own wiztool, with its own privileges.  /kernel/lib/wiztool
masks all functions that are relevant to security, so that any
inheriting object only has the level of access appropriate for the
owner of that object.

As a result, command security is handled by only three objects:
/kernel/sys/driver, /kernel/lib/auto and /kernel/lib/wiztool.  An
enormous improvement, in my view.

Could one do something similar by having a /kernel/lib/command,
which would handle all security concerns for command access,
and then have all command files inherit that? It's not quite
parallel to the wiztool method, but it's not terribly
different.

That would concentrate security-related code in fewer objects, but it
would still require different privileges for commands performed by
the same object, depending on what player is executing the command.
I consider this a possible weakness, and it has been an actual
weakness for many mudlibs in the past.

I wrote the above assuming that you meant it as a minimal change to
the /cmds system.  It doesn't apply if you want to let all commands
be inherited by a single object, unique for each player.

The "owner" of an object in the kernel library is very similar to a
"uid" in older mudlibs, but there are some differences.  The owner
of an object is not changable.  Once a wiztool object has been created,
it is tied to a particular wizard for its lifetime.  Of course, even a
uid system can eventually be made secure, but it is good for a security
system to have as few points of attack as possible.

I just checked, and it appears to be fairly simple to break Melville's
security.

 - The function set_creator() is not nomask.
 - Arrange for some code to be executed during another player's
   command (for example, he walks into your room) and you can change
   the creator of an object you made to that player.
 - The creator of any object can be reset to "Driver" from a callout.
 - Call user->set_privileges() from a callout, and the privileges
   are reset to "login".
 - valid_read() does not first resolve the path it checks.
 - valid_write() only resolves the path it checks if called from
   a function called "log_file".

All this from checking /system/auto/security.c -- I'm sure there is
more, but at this point I can already arbitrarily rewrite LPC source
files :-)

Making a mudlib secure is not a trivial task.  General guidelines are:

 - Define the basic system in a small set of mostly static source
   files.  Especially do not put security-related code in often-changed
   files.
 - Have as few points of attack as possible, and make sure you know
   where these are.  Avoid complexity.
 - For new mudlibs, design your security system before anything else.

Regardless of the memory usage issue (which is probably quite moot these days
with memory prices being as they are), you might want to consider the impact
of your design on runtime changes.  With a modular setup you can more easily
update specific functionality without requiring people to e.g. logout and back
in in order for the changes to apply to them.  The ability to upgrade objects
gets you a long way, but being able to change functionality in the most
flexible ways is powerful (especially when it comes to bug fixing).  The extra
cost storing a few pointers here and there is really worth it :)

Back in the bad old days before there was DGD, the most serious
problem with this method was updating the code. If you wanted
to change (say) a command, and the command code was in the player
object, then you could update player.c, and player.c would have
the new command. But all existing clones kept the old code, ie
the old version of the command. The only way you could get the
new command to the players was to make them all quit and log back
in. Players complain about such things.

The reason to move the command to a separate command object was
so that you could update the command object, then when players
typed the command, the thread would be passed to the (now updated)
command object and would work properly. No need to force all the
players to log out and back in.

With DGD this may be less of an issue because it may be possible
to update the code of existing clones of player.c. I am not expert
in this matter and will encourage others to comment on whether
this strategy is feasible or not.

But if DGD can update code in existing player clones, which I think
it can, then that removes the main problem of a big user file. A big
object is not a problem as long as you inherit correctly, and the
rumors that big objects are slower objects are greatly exaggerated.
Larger objects are very slightly slower due to longer lookup times,
but my memory (again, experts please correct me if I'm wrong) is
that lookup times for functions and variables are order log(N) and
so it's really not a big deal. And, passing a thread to a command
object also takes time.

All that said, I prefer command objects, primarily because it
means you can edit commands without having to edit player.c.
If you make a typo and screwup give.c, then no one can use the
give command until you fix it, but for a few minutes they can
cope with that. If you make a typo and screw up player.c, then
no one can log in until you fix it, and that's Bad. Also, just
for organizational purposes I like the idea of having a directory
of commands, with subdirectories, so I can control command
access with the path structure. It also means you can allow
users who are less privileged than top administrators to edit
some of your commands. Only top administrators should have
edit access to player.c, for obvious reasons. You also need to
make sure that only top adminstrators have access to file
handling commands, but you can allow lower wizards to handle
other commands, such as guild commands.

And that said, I'm sure my preference is based 90% on the fact that,
as a longtime MudOS/TMI-2 user, I'm used to a command directory
method. Wiztools freak me out, for no good reason. Most people
who use DGD seem to be more used to the wiztool method. I'm
sure it's equally good, and it's better if that's what you're
used to, but command bins are what I'm used to, so that's what
I use.

  Yup.  This method is probably actually faster than
breaking it up into smaller objects -- you'll find
that the objects wind up having to send a lot of
information back and forth to the main object since
there's a lot of shared state that everybody cares
about.  That means that the modular method uses more
function calls, so the extra overhead in calling a
top-level function once is less than the extra
overhead of extra between-object function calls.

  So the one-object approach is actually faster if you
do it right.  However, it's also far less modular and
convenient.  More to the point, the total speed hit is
really, really small.  If your MUD is maxing out the
processor (and it shouldn't be for any normal kind of
MUD), this isn't going to be real problem.  Instead
you'll have something else that is either really,
really inefficient or just really, really hard to
calculate in realtime.  Modern processors are scarily
fast, even on cheapo desktop boxes.

  Yup.  Phantasmal does some of this, but not as much
as Melville.  I separate out big areas of
functionality (like say/emote/tell/gossip/etc) that
are related to each other into wiztool-like objects,
but I don't separate out each individual command.  I
find that this is the best compromise, for me
personally, when it comes to maintenance.  I like all
the related commands to be near each other in case I
have to fix a bug in all the communications commands,
but I don't want to have to sift through all the
non-communications commands.

  Melville's method is pretty damn cool for command
modularity, though.  Eventually I plan to do something
similar, but not as fine-grained.  The Phantasmal
social/soul commands do something like that, in fact.

> The later should ultimately take up more space in

  Yup.  Because of the way DGD does swapping and
memory management, this means they'll be significantly
larger.  On the other hand, say you take an extra 8kb
penalty for every player...  Dude, it's 8kb.  Suck it
up and deal.  If you have 200 simultaneous players,
that's 1.6MB.  And if you have 200 players, the extra
buck and a half spent on memory shouldn't be a big
deal :-)

  I'll respond to Steve Schmidt in a minute -- he made
some good points.

  As you speculate later, DGD removes this problem. 
You can update the whole user object in-place without
a hitch.  You can also update any module in-place
without a hitch.  So both ways do this perfectly now
if your upgrade code works.  Phantasmal's, for
instance, does this just fine.

  This is correct.  Again, I believe that the cost for
modularity will actually make a large user object
*faster* in almost every case.  However, the total
difference is so small that you should ignore it.

  Yup.  What he said.  This is one reason that I'm
working to make Phantasmal more modular.  When I screw
up the socials file, nobody cares.  When I screw up
player.c, I may not be able to log in to fix it!

  I'm actually against this, but I prefer to control
command access in the command code and with keywords
or attribute bits.  Matter of personal preference. 
His way works much more painlessly for simple
differences, my way extends better to complicated
stuff.

  This is a big one.  It's one more reason I'm working
on more modularity.  Letting random admins add new
socials is a fine idea.  Letting them edit abusable
commands like "give" and "say" is less secure.

  I handle this by having configuration files for
certain commands.  For instance, social commands use a
text configuration file.  The cmd_social() function is
still off limits to everybody but implementors, but
lesser admins could edit the existing social file
and/or add new social files.  However, it's also nice
to be able to let other admins write actual code, not
just text config files.  I'm working on that -- DGD
actually has some pretty cool sandboxing facilities if
you know how to use them.  I've never seen anything
really use them, though.

<h2>Designing Your AUTO Object</h2>

<p>There are a number of tradeoffs in designing your AUTO object.
One of the simplest, and the most fundamental, is: how much
functionality will it have? Will you have a simple AUTO object with
only the barest and most necessary functionality, rather like the
Kernel Library? Will you have an AUTO object containing a wide
variety of standard library functions on strings and data
structures? Will you include functions on finding an object's
physical (in the MUD) environment and inventory?</p>

<p>Remember that any data in your AUTO object is duplicated
throughout every object in the MUD. This includes LWOs and other
objects that you may want to be fairly small &mdash; DGD has no
structures, so if your single global AUTO object is huge, then
there will be no such thing as a small object in your MUD unless
you build it out of arrays and mappings.</p>

<p>However, remember also that if you take all the data and
functionality out of the AUTO object, you'll need to explicitly
inherit other libraries and perhaps use (slow) call_other()
statements to call your commonly-used functions.</p>

<h3>Driver Issues, Size and Space</h3>

<p>In DGD, there is an obscure cost associated with functions in
the AUTO object that are neither static nor private: all such
functions have a cost of two bytes a piece in <i>every</i>
inheriting object's program. This is also true for non-private
functions in all other (i.e. non-auto) objects.</p>

<p>Normally, this is not much of a problem. However, if you were to
have 200 such functions in the auto object, every other program in
the game but that of the driver object would become 400 bytes
larger.</p>

<p>You can solve this by either keeping such functions out of the
AUTO object, or by making the functions static so that only
subclasses can call them.</p>

<p>There is no speed issue with a large number of functions. DGD
does excellent caching, and on average the cost of a function call
does not increase with the number of functions available. However,
do remember that regardless of other factors, no amount of caching
will make a call_other() as fast as a local function call.</p>

<h3>Function Performance</h3>

<p>There are several performance issues to consider when deciding
whether to put a particular function into the AUTO object.</p>

<p>A call to a function in the auto object uses the special
CALL_AFUNC instruction, which is 3 bytes in size. Exactly the same
functionality would be available with the CALL_DFUNC instruction,
which takes 4 bytes. Thus, programs that call functions in the auto
object will be slightly smaller. In the most extreme case, a
function that consists of nothing but function calls will be almost
25% smaller if CALL_AFUNC can be used for every call. There will be
a barely measurable performance difference.</p>

<p>Note that programs larger than 2K are compressed before being
saved in the swap file, where the compression factor depends on the
redundancy of the byte code, so the size advantage in the swap file
would be much less than 25% if the function mentioned above is
large enough.</p>

<p>Inheriting a utility object, which itself does not inherit
anything, increases the size of the inheriting program by about 16
bytes.</p>

<p>Putting everything into the auto object increases the size of
the working set. For a single object the difference won't amount to
much, but a mudlib wholly designed with the idea of keeping the
working set small will have a performance advantage. For a
different take on "working set", consider processor cache vs. main
memory, rather than main memory vs. disk storage. The Xeon
processor has a 1 Mb cache. Keeping the working set small enough to
fit inside that cache will be an enormous speedup.</p>

<p>You can move functions into a separate 'manager' object rather
than the AUTO object. You'll be replacing calls to an inherited
function with call_other statements. A call_other is slower than a
local function call, especially if the first argument is a string
(since an additional call_other to the driver object will be needed
to resolve the object name).</p>

<h3>Multiple Files and File Size</h3>

<p>It's often convenient to break functionality up into separate
files. Normally in DGD that means parent objects. The functionality
and variable scope are kept separate, and cleanliness is
maintained. The AUTO object can't inherit from any libraries. If it
did, they would inherit it again (since every library does), which
would make a circular dependency.</p>

<p>However, if you're making a large AUTO object and want the
convenience of multiple files, you <i>can</i> use #include to put
them all in one place rather than using 'inherit'. This is one of
the few times that #include is a reasonable way to add functions to
an object.</p>

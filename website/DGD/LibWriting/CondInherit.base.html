<h2>How Can I Conditionally Inherit a File?</h2>

<p>When a program includes a file, the path_include function is
called in the driver object. By returning a different file name,
you can change what file is included. You can then choose between
including an empty file and one that inherits the program you'd
like inherited.</p>

<p>The file must be valid either way, which is why you can't just
have path_include return (nil) and include nothing at all.</p>

<p>Note that the standard include file (usually
&frasl;include&frasl;std.h) does not have path_include() called for
it, so you can't redirect that one. However, you can #include a
file <i>from</i> the standard include file, and redirect that
one.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library does this in a <a href=
"../Kernel/SecondAuto.html">slightly different way</a>, but
underneath it's doing the same thing. It uses AUTO as the name of
the file included by the standard include file, which is why you
need an empty file called AUTO to use this method.</p>

<p>Note that Kernel Library or not, you can use this for
conditional inclusion, not just inheritance. So if you'd like to
change what gets put into the standard header, just have it include
another file (again, the Kernel uses AUTO as that name) and you can
put different #includes and #defines in the different AUTO objects
that you return under different circumstances. This is a
<i>great</i> way to do scripting, because you can change the
script's parent objects, predefined constants and standard library
and AUTO-object functions, all without making the script itself
have to include or inherit anything.</p>

<p>Phantasmal's test game, Seas of Night, is a good example of the
scripting usage above. Have a look at its custom rooms in version
0.003 or later.</p>

<h2>Starting Again (and Again, and Again) From Scratch</h2>

<p>As for the larger conversation topic, I think the basic problem
is that the overwhelming amount of work being done in the LPMud
area is endless redundant reimplementations of trivial low level
libraries that should have been standardized a decade ago. There is
virtually no coordination in the LPMud world; it seems like every
single good programmer whose LPC interest is peaking finds a new
ancient mudlib to bring from the 1991 era to the 1993 era, and it
just STOPS there. I don't understand it. &ndash; Par Winzell</p>

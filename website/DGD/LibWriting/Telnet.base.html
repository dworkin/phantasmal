<h2>Implementing Extended Telnet Protocol in DGD</h2>

<p>DGD has 'telnet ports', which implement the basic telnet protocol.
However, they do so in a very limited and rigid way, and Dworkin has no
intention of extending them, or even modifying their behavior. The
network patch for DGD makes no change in this, and the ANSI color patch,
while it allows certain outgoing high-ASCII characters, still requires
patching DGD. What should you do to fix this?</p>

<p>The best answer is to implement your own telnet server in LPC and
connect it to a DGD binary port. This allows you to configure the result
in LPC rather than patching DGD, and lets you send things like
international high-ASCII characters and ANSI color codes when and how
you like. It also lets you handle parts of the telnet protocol that DGD
does not, such as changes in the screen size, and default terminal
settings.</p>

<p>If you want to implement the telnet protocol, you may find <a href=
"http://www.cryosphere.org/mud-protocol.html">this page</a> highly
useful. You'll also want to use some RFCs. Here are some potentially
useful ones:</p>
<pre>
  RFC 854 - Telnet protocol specification.
  RFC 855 - Telnet option specifications.
  RFC 1091 - Telnet terminal-type option.
  </pre>

<p>There are bugs in how older MUD servers treat newlines, and the same
is true of older clients. However, the bugs seem to be all different and
highly platform-dependent, so you'll need to work this one out for
yourself. Whether a telnet linefeed is newline-then-CR or
CR-then-newline or just one or just the other seems to be highly
platform dependent. When in doubt, be tolerant.</p>

<p>Be sure to test with a variety of telnet clients. Even recent clients
seem to have a variety of odd bugs in the protocol. When testing,
remember that some clients will even do odd things like detect the
string "password" and turn off character echo afterward rather than
relying on the server to turn off echo at the appropriate times.</p>

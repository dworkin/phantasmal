  <h2> Implementing Extended Telnet Protocol in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    DGD has 'telnet ports', which implement part of the telnet
    protocol.  However, they do so in a very limited and rigid way,
    and Dworkin has no intention of extending them, or even modifying
    their behavior.  The network patch for DGD makes no change in
    this, and the ANSI color patch, while it allows certain outgoing
    high-ASCII characters, still requires patching DGD.  What should
    you do to fix this?
  </p>

  <p>
    The best answer is to implement your own telnet server in LPC and
    connect it to a DGD binary port.  This allows you to configure the
    result in LPC rather than patching DGD, and lets you send things
    like international high-ASCII characters and ANSI color codes when
    and how you like.  It also lets you handle parts of the telnet
    protocol that DGD does not, such as changes in the screen size,
    and default terminal settings.

Subject: [DGD]Characters getting lost, part 2

Regarding my previous post: I found out that characters in range 80h -
9Fh get filetered out by DGD (it's feature, not bug), which is
unfortunate because standard Windows encoding for Czech language
contains characters in this range. 

So my questions are: 
Can I turn this filering off without re-compiling the executable?
If not, what exactly should be changed in the source to allow character
80h-9fh through? (I am not C++ expert so please be fairly specific.) I
will get someone to recompile the executable for me. Thanks.

For Unicode (and even for Czech) I would suggest using binary connections.

DGD does not use or depend on any character set for binary connections.
What is sent and received is raw data.  Any interpretation is up to the
mudlib and the client.  Unicode will require some sort of dedicated
client anyhow, which is another argument in favour of using binary
connections.

Telnet connections are a hack, a combination of mostly useful telnet
escape sequence interpretation, buffering, and filtering of potentially
dangerous characters.  Any argument against one of these features can
be extended to all of them.  I recommend using binary connections for
all new mudlibs.

It is a very reasonable request.

The problem with so-called upper ASCII characters is that terminals
which ignore the upper bit may interpret some of these characters as
control codes, with results such as a lock-up of the terminal, or
inserting a string in the terminal's input queue which is then
executed as a command.  I have worked on such terminals for much of
my life as a programmer and know that they are still in use.

Apparently, such terminals are unknown at terminal.cz. :)

I dislike the idea of a config file setting for this.  For both
Czech players having their language filtered out on a mud
configured one way, and players on old terminals experiencing
lockups on a mud configured the other way, I would consider
this to be a failure of the server.  I must regretfully
decide against removing this filter on telnet connections.

However, it is certainly true that the editor should not add
another layer of protection that distorts Chech characters
even on a binary connection.  This is simply a feature of the
original "ex" editor which I unthinkingly copied, within DGD
to be considered as a bug.  I'll fix that.

Dworkin

hmm the ansi color patch for host.h looks odd. This is what the patch says 
to do, put


--- 273,280 ----
  # define HT   '\011'
  # define LF   '\012'
  # define VT   '\013'
  # define FF   '\014'
  # define CR   '\015'
+ # define ESC  '\033'

  # define ALGN(x, s)   (((x) + (s) - 1) & ~((s) - 1))

in place of starting on line 273

/* these must be the same on all hosts */
# define BEL	'\007'
# define BS	'\010'
# define HT	'\011'  - line 273
# define LF	'\012'
# define VT	'\013'
# define FF	'\014'
# define CR	'\015'

# define ALGN(x, s)	(((x) + (s) - 1) & ~((s) - 1))

When I view it in Borland C++ it color codes everything green before I 
change anything. When I replace it with the patch, the + in front of + # 
define ESC  '\033' breaks the color code and turns red. normally its in 
green, but the + is in red, and everything else is in black and blue.

Should I just delete the +?

There's several.  Start here for some groundwork:

  RFC 854 - Telnet protocol specification.
  RFC 855 - Telnet option specifications.

There are quite a few describing further details, I suggest you fetch an
rfc-index.txt from a web or ftp server near you and grep through it for
'Telnet'. :-)

The one you're then looking for is RFC 1091:

  1091 Telnet terminal-type option. J. VanBokkelen. Feb-01-1989.
       (Format: TXT=13439 bytes) (Obsoletes RFC0930) (Status: PROPOSED
       STANDARD)

Good luck. :-)

Erwin.

I did this about two years ago and it isn't _that_ hard. It's a matter of
reading a handfull of RFC's about the TELNET OPTION protocol. This lets
your parse the environment variables that are send with a telnet
connection.

The ones usually transmitted are DISPLAY, TERM and PRINTER.

There's a third option: XMLterm

I've heard of an Xterm implemented to use streaming HTML/XML tags instead of
VT* codes. Think, Pueblo. This was a modification to the current Mozilla
browser. Or more precisely, it uses the XUL toolset in Mozilla and some
other stuff to create the Xterm.

You can check out the site at http://www.xmlterm.com

Considering that Mozilla has a built in IRC client written mostly in
Javascript et. al., adapting that serve this. 

I've been contemplating doing something like that for years now, ever since
I heard of Pueblo. Which, btw, though discontinued, the source to that is
floating around somewhere.

Let me know if any of you are interested in collaborating in doing such a
project. I have a spare server on a semi-static connection available on a
limited basis.

DGD does indeed filter escape sequences out on purpose. I believe Dworkin
considers them annoying on the verge of a security threat. There are three
options,

 A) Take the hint and don't use ANSI, which is indeed damn annoying,
 B) Don't use 'telnet' mode for the socket but 'tcp' (raw) and write
    your own telnet protocol handler in LPC. It could be argued that
    the driver shouldn't implement such a high-level function anyway
    and frankly, apart from the echo hack for when the user enters a
    password, the whole telnet protocol is kind of pointless anyway.
 C) The easiest; go find this piece of code in comm.c:


	    } else if ((*p & 0x7f) < ' ' && *p != HT && *p != BEL && *p != BS) {
		/*
		 * illegal character
		 */
		p++;
		--len;
		continue;
	    }

    and add *p != '\033' in the list of exceptions in that if statement.
    For 1.1.97 this code is at line 298.

  I'd say not just \r, because that's frequently used
for weird little animation things like status bars. 
You can print the bar, send a \r, print, send \r, and
repeat.  So that should do the carriage return without
the newline.

  I'm not sure whether to treat \n\r the same as \r\n.
 My immediate answer would be "yes", because if you
treat them as having individual effect, the two
together do the same thing.  The \n takes you downward
by one line, not necessarily affecting the horizontal
location in the line.  The \r returns you to the far
left edge of the line, but doesn't change what line
you're on.

  My understanding was that you couldn't just sent
Unix-style \n line endings to telnet, and that you
always needed to be careful to double them up to \r\n
just in case you had to deal with a DOS-style client.

  I believe the vast majority of text sent across the
'net does this.  However, I'm pretty sure some doesn't
work that way, because PUTTY (my Windows-based telnet
client) has a specific option for dealing with \n-only
text.  But in general, doubling the line endings up is
safer when sending, and accepting either \n or \n\r is
safer when receiving.  Just \r, though, shouldn't act
like just \n.

  Scary.  Maybe you should make it configurable.  That
way you could treat \r as a return keystroke by
default, at least long enough to let somebody log in,
and then more aggressive MUDs would have the option of
making \r a carriage return so they could do their
little status-bar animations.

  They could do it like some MUDs do color -- display
it to you and ask you to report whether you see it
correctly.

  That'd be up to the MUD, though.  Your telnet
implementation could just have an API to let the MUD
turn that on or off.

  Not a factor.  What DGD does internally is fine and
dandy, but that has no effect on how it treats stuff
coming in over telnet.  Telnet is effectively an alien
protocol, and DGD's internal representation shouldn't
be a factor in how you treat it.

  I mean, Intel boxes are little-endian, but they
still have to do Network Byte Order like everybody
else, right?

  Similarly, Unix telnet implementations double up the
return characters even though they internally use a
single newline character.  Telnet is a foreign data
protocol, and should be treated like one.

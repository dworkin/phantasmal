  <h2> Delays in In-MUD Scripting Languages </h2>

  <p>
    In a MUD, mobile scripts and object scripts tend to be pretty
    simple.  They mostly go through a set of actions in order, with an
    occasional conditional (like an 'if' statement) or loop.  So
    mostly LPC works very well for them, and is far more than they
    need.  In LPMUDs, it's usually far and away the most convenient to
    just use LPC for all your scripting - it's fast, it's flexible,
    and you've already got a nice interface to everything your MUD
    does.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, there's a problem with that.  Specifically, there's a
    problem if you want your script to delay for a few seconds or a
    few minutes and then start happening again.  Say that you want a
    mobile to look at what it's been given, wait a few seconds and
    then give it back disdainfully.  It's important to wait that few
    seconds.  The problem is that DGD is single-threaded, which means
    that execution rounds need to finish quickly so that the rest of
    the MUD can get on with what it's doing.  A three-second delay
    loop isn't an option, and would halt the rest of the MUD, spoiling
    the effect.  It doesn't work.
  </p>

  <p>
    One way to do this is to schedule call_outs, or do something
    roughly similar.  That's a bit ugly because you need to split your
    function into pieces -- &quote;give_script_start&quote;,
    &quote;give_script_after_delay_1&quote;,
    &quote;give_script_after_delay_2&quote;, etc.  However, once you
    get over the syntactic ugliness it's not too bad.  It does what
    you want it to.  You just have to cut your script up into lots of
    little sub-scripts.
  </p>

  <p>
    You could write an entire other language on top of LPC, or perhaps
    <a href="ChangingLPC.html">modify LPC in some way</a> for the
    scripting language.  Or compile the language to LPC.  Then you
    could interpret that language, which would let you pause it for
    delay statements and go back to what you were doing.
  </p>

  <p>
    You could queue up actions in advance, but have LPC functions that
    put actions into the queue.  So you'd have functions like
    mobile_do_run(), mobile_do_sharpen(), etc that would queue up
    actions like &quot;run&quot; and &quot;sharpen&quot; to be done
    when the current action is finished.  Your scripts could have
    conditionals and other interesting code when they first ran, and
    add actions into the queue in variable ways.  Unfortunately, that
    means that all control structures must have finished before any of
    the delays happen.  That's not great.  It means that mobiles will
    get stupider as the script goes on for more clock-time.  And if a
    mobile needs to enter a room and then respond to it, it will need
    to use some variation of the call_out approach above.
  </p>

  <p>
    A third possibility is to run the script again after each delay
    statement, and pass some kind of argument to it to tell it where
    it came back.  So your function would use switch() or if() to jump
    to where you should be after the delay.  A delay would become a
    return statement, along with how long you should delay, and then
    you'd get called again with an argument for how long you've
    delayed or something.  Your builders would hate you and want to
    kill you, but it would work.
  </p>

  <p>
    A popular variation on the above is to write an LPC preprocessor
    which will turn you delay() statement into a case for a switch()
    statement, and put a switch() inside your function to jump to the
    right case.  It's potentially more annoying to deal with restoring
    values of variables this way, though.  Remember that local
    variables lose their value if you jump out of the function and
    then back in.

Subject: [DGD] Delay statements in scripting

Merry is Skotos' LPC-based scripting system. It's pretty much straight 
LPC with 'additions' -- e.g. delays, which are implemented with the 
switch solution given by Dworkin above.

Merry is parsed using parse_string() and a rathed mutated version of 
Felix's old LPC-grammar-for-parse_string() grammar. It's broken down 
into a binary format and stored in LWO's. The LWO can reconstruct the 
Merry source or underlying LPC source on demand (the former for editing 
the script, the latter for compiling it to a real LPC object).

The systems keeps a cache of a few hundred compiled Merry scripts 
around, but they can be destructed and recompiled on demand.

One tip for anybody implementing this: remember that the compiled 
objects can't keep any real state. For delays, for example, the callouts 
themselves can't be kept in the generated object. You -must- be able to 
destruct such objects at will.

If I execute an action that requires a delay, it's my body that should 
keep the callout, and then relayeto the appropriate script handler when 
the callout expires.

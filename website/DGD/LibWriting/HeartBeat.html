  <h2> Heart-Beat and Resets in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    Most LP-type MUDs have a function called something like reset(),
    or heart_beat(), which is called periodically.  It might be called
    every few seconds, or every few minutes, or just when a player
    enters a new room for the first time, or for the first time in a
    long while.  Since DGD has no reset or heartbeat functionality,
    how would you implement the same functionality?
  </p>

  <h3> Periodic Calls </h3>

  <p>
    DGD doesn't have alarm() statements and you don't want to run a
    single thread of execution for all that long.  Remember that
    swapping and recompiling happen between threads, and you can't
    normally run a thread while another thread is executing.  So
    you'll need to repond periodically to a timer, and you'll have to
    use DGD's call_out() kfun to do it.  Have each call_out handler
    schedule itself to be run after a given interval &mdash; a few
    seconds, a few minutes, whatever.  Then have it execute the
    statements you want to happen every so many seconds.  Remember to
    schedule the new call_out() <i>first</i>, because if an error
    happens somewhere in the call_out handler, you don't want it to
    permanently stop the timer.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll probably want to use catch() and rlimits() statements when
    calling periodic functions.  That will avoid infinite loops and
    make sure that if one object's function has an error, the next
    object's function still gets called.  The catch() and rlimits()
    are useful no matter how you choose to handle timing.
  </p>

  <h3> Resets </h3>

  <p>
    In addition to periodic timing, you can call functions when idle
    objects are used again, something like a reset().  When the object
    is used (a room being visited, for instance), you can set a
    variable to the current time, showing the the object to be in use.
    Then when a player uses the object again (comes back into a room),
    check the time variable.  If it's been longer than the reset
    period, call the reset() function to put the room back into a
    pristine state.  If it hasn't, don't do anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    A variation on the idle timer above would be to use DGD's
    call_touch() kfun on idle objects.  The call_touch kfun specifies
    an LPC function to call on the object when it is next accessed by
    LPC code.  If you rarely or never call functions on idle LPC
    objects, this can replace your own timer.  Specifically, you can
    set a call_out with a given delay when the resettable object is
    used.  When the object is next used, cancel that call_out and set
    another one with the same delay.  If the object ever goes unused
    for long enough, the call_out will trigger.  The call_out can use
    the call_touch kfun to schedule a reset for the next time the
    object is accessed.  The object, being idle for awhile, will be
    swapped to disk.  And then, when it finally gets used again, it
    will be reset when retrieved.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may find yourself unnecessarily calling the call_touch()-set
    function when you do operations that touch every object in your
    MUD.  For instance, saving objects on shutdown may touch every
    object, so you'll find that you reset all of them.  However, if
    you're careful (for instance, you can use statedumps instead of
    datafiles, which won't trigger your call_touch functions), you can
    avoid this problem.
  </p>

  <h3> Finding All the Objects </h3>

  <p>
    You can add objects to a registry when they're created, like the
    Kernel Library does with its ObjRegD.  If you do so, then you've
    got a list of all the LPC objects in the MUD.  By using those
    lists, it would be straightforward (but somewhat slow) to call a
    function on every LPC object, including clones, in the game.  Your
    auto object would build the lists &mdash; see the Kernel Library
    code for details on how.  If you use the Kernel Library, a
    HeartBeatD in the System directory would run through the lists and
    call the heartbeat function on each object every so often, in
    response to a call_out timer.  If you don't use the Kernel, then
    you'll need to track objects within your AUTO object somehow, and
    have a HeartBeatD or similar daemon call periodically in the same
    way.
  </p>

  <h3> Swapping Behavior </h3>

  <p>
    If you have a function that is called on every object in the MUD,
    you'll find that you drag every object into memory every time it
    gets called.  Since DGD is designed to handle MUDs much larger
    than available memory, you're potentially getting yourself into a
    sticky situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem can be partially solved by making objects idle if no
    players are near them.  That means that rooms without players
    won't be reset, which is good for saving swapping and CPU time,
    but means a heartbeat function can't be used as a consistent
    counter &mdash; it skips when the object is idle.
  </p>

  <h3> Logging Out Idle Players </h3>

  <p>
    Either of of the above can be used to log off idle players.  It's
    easy to measure a player's idle time &mdash; just reset it every
    time you receive new network input to that player's user object.
    Then either have a timer that checks periodically (say every one
    minute) and logs out every player that has been idle too long, or
    have a per-player call_out statement.  When the player sends
    network input, set a call_out() for three hours in the future to
    log him out.  When he sends input again, cancel the old call_out
    and set up a new one for three hours from the <i>new</i> input
    time.  Continue until the player quits.  Make sure to remove the
    last call_out if you're not destructing the object it gets set on!
    Or continue until the call_out() happens and the player is logged
    out for being idle.
  </p>

  <p>
    While you could do it on-demand by checking at every network
    input, that's not actually useful.  That would log the player out
    for idleness only if they ever came back and typed something
    again, which misses the point.  You'd rather close their
    connection as soon as possible after they're idle to free up
    resources for your MUD.  For this reason, the call_touch approach
    isn't useful.

@@TITLE Interrupt Call@@

<h2>Dealing with the driver-&gt;interrupt() Call</h2>

<p>When your MUD's driver object receives a call to interrupt() from
DGD, it means the server has received a kill signal. Normally, that
means you'll want to force all users to quit, dump any appropriate
state, and call shutdown(). You may also want to write to a log file or
set up an error message to let somebody know that the MUD has received
an error or kill signal and shut down.</p>

<p>Note that shutdown() will not take effect until the end of the thread
in which you call it. If shutdown() is not called within interrupt, DGD
will not shut down. So you can start a timer or other shutdown sequence
if necessary.</p>

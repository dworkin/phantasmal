@@TITLE Interrupt Call@@

<h2>Dealing with the driver-&gt;interrupt() Call</h2>

<p>When your MUD's driver object receives a call to interrupt()
from DGD, it means the server has received a kill signal. Normally,
that means you'll want to force all users to quit, dump any
appropriate state, and call shutdown(). You may also want to write
to a log file or set up an error message to let somebody know that
the MUD has received an error or kill signal and shut down.</p>

<p>Note that shutdown() will not take effect until the end of the
thread in which you call it. If shutdown() is not called within
interrupt, DGD will not shut down. So you can start a timer or
other shutdown sequence if necessary.</p>

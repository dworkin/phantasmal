  <h2> Implementing Extended Telnet Protocol in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    DGD has 'telnet ports', which implement part of the telnet
    protocol.  However, they do so in a very limited and rigid way,
    and Dworkin has no intention of extending them, or even modifying
    their behavior.  The network patch for DGD makes no change in
    this, and the ANSI color patch, while it allows certain outgoing
    high-ASCII characters, still requires patching DGD.  What should
    you do to fix this?
  </p>

  <p>
    The best answer is to implement your own telnet server in LPC and
    connect it to a DGD binary port.  This allows you to configure the
    result in LPC rather than patching DGD, and lets you send things
    like international high-ASCII characters and ANSI color codes when
    and how you like.  It also lets you handle parts of the telnet
    protocol that DGD does not, such as changes in the screen size,
    and default terminal settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    To implement the telnet protocol, you'll want to use some RFCs.
    Here are some potentially useful ones:
  </p>

  <pre>
  RFC 854 - Telnet protocol specification.
  RFC 855 - Telnet option specifications.
  1091 Telnet terminal-type option. J. VanBokkelen. Feb-01-1989.
       (Format: TXT=13439 bytes) (Obsoletes RFC0930) (Status: PROPOSED
       STANDARD)
  </pre>

  <p>
    There are bugs in how older MUD servers treat newlines, and the
    same is true of older clients.  However, the bugs seem to be all
    different and highly platform-dependent, so you'll need to work
    this one out for yourself.  Whether a telnet linefeed is
    newline-then-CR or CR-then-newline or just one or just the other
    seems to be highly platform dependent.  When in doubt, be
    tolerant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be sure to test with a variety of telnet clients.  Even recent
    clients seem to have a variety of odd bugs in the protocol.  When
    testing, remember that some clients will even do odd things like
    detect the string &quot;password&quot; and turn off character echo
    afterward rather than relying on the server to turn off echo at
    the appropriate times.

It's because you are using a Mac.  DGD uses line mode for telnet clients,
and binary mode is not well-defined for line mode in the telnet protocol.
DGD uses a hack to enable it on many clients, but apparently it fails on
the Mac.

I am not planning any changes in DGD's telnet support, since even minor
changes are bound to break clients on some other platform.  Instead I am
thinking about a standard protocol for a new mud client, a version of
which I will probably release in Java.  Oh, and it will connect to the
binary port, with the protocol level on the server side handled by LPC.

Dworkin

DGD always sends \r\n as a newline on telnet connections.  But it does
not respond to some of the more advanced settings that putty may be
attempting.  Your options are to modify dgd/src/comm.c to more fully
implement telnet option negotiation, to change putty settings instead
of DGD/LPC code, or to connect to the binary port.

Dworkin

As usual, Dworkin answered my question before I could ask it :)

Not too long ago, I was working on a telnet class in C++ and sent mail 
to a couple of people claiming to have found the oldest and most trivial 
bug in all of DikuMUD Land... namely, if you look at the source to just 
about any of the diku variants, you'll see they send text out the socket 
with "\n\r" as the line termination characters.  According to the telnet 
specification, all transmissions in line mode must use "\r\n" as the 
line termination sequence, if you want to send the opposite, it would 
actually be sent as "\n\r\0".  The telnet server (which DGD acts as) 
will always send things in this form and expect them in this form.  It's 
up to the client (putty, your local /bin/telnet, or tinyfugue, etc...) 
to correctly translate them back and forth between the telnet spec and 
your local machine's interpretation.  Most unix-like platforms use "\n", 
most DOS-like platforms use "\r\n", and I think most pre-OSX macs use "\r".

Needless to say, reporting this bug didn't raise many red flags with 
anyone who noticed... but what Thomas describes is what I would expect 
to happen if either side (client or server) wasn't correctly honouring 
the protocol.  Besides changing settings, you might want to try another 
client as well.

Subject: [DGD] ansi colours

Assuming you're just talking about ANSI escape sequences in general and 
not a DGD-specific thing, I have a list of the ansi escape sequences on 
my web-site.  It's not wildly accurate (in terms of which sequences came 
from which specific standards), but it's what I used for the muds I've 
worked on and my mud client.

Subject: [DGD] Re: ansi colours

Have you considered the possibility that the \e is not an escape
supported by LPC and it really _is_ an 'e' that you send to the
client?

    > @code "\e"[0]
    $28 = 101

This is what you want, however:

    > @code "\033"[0]
    $29 = 27

Hope that helps,

Subject: [DGD] ansi colours

These might be of some use to you, when using the escape \033 sequence in
files the editors or mor'ing interprets the colours and not the codes so
You can't see the codes used like that in a file, these are visible as
colours in the mud as well as being editable:

"\x1B[0m"
"\x1B[1m"
"\x1B[31m"
"\x1B[32m"
"\x1B[33m"
"\x1B[34m"
"\x1B[35m"
"\x1B[36m"
"\x1B[37m"
"\x1B[41m"
"\x1B[42m"
"\x1B[43m"
"\x1B[44m"
"\x1B[45m"
"\x1B[46m"
"\x1B[47m"

Also of note, if you enable ansi in DGD, you should consider stripping escape
sequences in a user's issued command. Else they can change colour on other's
screen by just sending a 'realescape'<colorcode>. I imagine other strange
things are possible if you don't strip escape sequences. 

Did this in my old modified melville:
	result = strlen(str);
	for (i=0; i < result; i++)
	{
		if (str[i] < 32) { str[i] = ' '; }
	}

Happy Colouring!

Subject: [DGD] ANSI Patch for DGD 1.2.87

I decided to update the ansi patch, no reason why other than I was fiddling 
with various stuff which broke dgd badly and got tired of hand editing files 
after the fifth time I had to repatch from .85 up. 

The patch is now 1 file long and should patch in exactly like the 
experimental patches do (patch -p 0 < patchname) so long as you put it in 
the same directory.  It explains that in the top of the patch and all of the 
old files that were included in the older ansi patch are now included in 
this one and created in the dgd/doc/ansi directory. 

You can download it at: 

http://psychoticdelusions.net/dgd-patch/ansi-0.99.5-dgd-1.2.87.gz 

It's no better than the old patch it just applies cleanly with the patch 
command instead of requiring hand editing.  So if you've already patched 
THIS DOES NOTHING DIFFERENT LEAVE IT BE! :)  I've not tested it with the net 
patch or epp or any other patches, just vanilla 1.2.87. 

Anywho,

In college, I had a friend who would shout the following when he found 
a MUD that didn't strip incoming commands:
   - [clear screen]
   - [cursor movement] [big/bold/blink] <banner text> [repeat]
   - [reset scroll region]
   - [move cursor into new, smaller scroll region]

<h2>Can I Distribute my MUD Library as a State Dump?</h2>

<p>In DGD, you can restore from a State Dump, so a MUD Library
author could conceivably get his MUD running, then dump state, and
distribute the state dump rather than packaging up his source
files. (Note: this is mostly a thought exercise, though you may be
able to find a use for it).</p>

<p>Obviously, such a distribution would require very good
documentation (and&frasl;or a copy of the source files) so that the
consumers of the library would know how to use it.</p>

<p>There are obvious issues &mdash; without source, it would be
difficult for consumers of the MUD Library to upgrade objects,
since they would have to replace them entirely. Only a very stable
library could reasonably do this. Further, the library would have
to allow essentially any functionality to be possible so that it
didn't prevent later development. Thus, a design similar to the
Kernel Library would be useful in making this possible.</p>

<p>Since destructing the MUD Library's objects could potentially be
disastrous (remember, no source means that you can't upgrade a
library when an object that inherits it wants to be upgraded),
you'd want to strongly restrict such activities.</p>

<p>Since the consumer of the MUD Library has only the running copy
of his data, presumably he would need to do a state dump as well
rather than saving in any form. By definition, a MUD Library that
is distributed by statedump would need to be <a href=
"Persistence.html">persistent</a>.</p>

<p>An alternative to the no-source method would be to distribute a
MUD Library which has the source embedded in an in-game database of
source code. This would allow files to exist on disk only long
enough to edit them, and potentially not even that long since DGD
can compile an object from string data. MOO and Cold have similar
functionality, but this way, being fully text-based, would save the
details of indentation and whatnot that those servers don't.</p>

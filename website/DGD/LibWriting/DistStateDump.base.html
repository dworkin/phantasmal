  <h2> Can I Distribute my MUD Library as a State Dump? </h2>

  <p>
    In DGD, you can restore from a State Dump, so a MUD Library author
    could conceivably get his MUD running, then dump state, and
    distribute the state dump rather than packaging up his source
    files.  (Note: this is mostly a thought exercise, though you may
    be able to find a use for it).
  </p>

  <p>
    Obviously, such a distribution would require very good
    documentation (and&frasl;or a copy of the source files) so that
    the consumers of the library would know how to use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are obvious issues &mdash; without source, it would be
    difficult for consumers of the MUD Library to upgrade objects,
    since they would have to replace them entirely.  Only a very
    stable library could reasonably do this.  Further, the library
    would have to allow essentially any functionality to be possible
    so that it didn't prevent later development.  Thus, a design
    similar to the Kernel Library would be useful in making this
    possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since destructing the MUD Library's objects could potentially be
    disastrous (remember, no source means that you can't upgrade a
    library when an object that inherits it wants to be upgraded),
    you'd want to strongly restrict such activities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the consumer of the MUD Library has only the running copy of
    his data, presumably he would need to do a state dump as well
    rather than saving in any form.  By definition, a MUD Library that
    is distributed by statedump would need to be <a
    href="Persistence.html">persistent</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An alternative to the no-source method would be to distribute a
    MUD Library which has the source embedded in an in-game database
    of source code.  This would allow files to exist on disk only long
    enough to edit them, and potentially not even that long since DGD
    can compile an object from string data.  MOO and Cold have similar
    functionality, but this way, being fully text-based, would save
    the details of indentation and whatnot that those servers don't.

  <h2> Miscellaneous Issues in MUD Library Authoring </h2>

  <p>
    Have a set of core objects that define basic behaviour and
    limitations which cannot be rewritten from within the mud, not
    even by the mud administrator.  The Kernel Library puts these in
    the &frasl;kernel directory.  This is to enforce security limits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Never keep the config file (the one ending in .dgd) inside the MUD
    code tree.  It could be overwritten and used to give an attacker
    access to files outside the mudlib, such as the password file on
    the host system.  Changing it can also allow your MUD to
    masquerade as a different service, and potentially open different
    incoming ports.  If you're using the network package, it can
    easily cause your MUD to be usable as a relay or a zombie for a
    distributed attack on other systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Don't put the swapfile in the mudlib directory, either, since
    information which is otherwise hidden inside objects will be
    readable from it.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll find that the in-RAM memory use of your library, measured
    in sectors, is driven by several things.  Roughly in order of
    importance, those things are: 1) the number of rooms and portable
    items in your world.  2) The time your MUD has been running
    &mdash; DGD is disk-based, so content is loaded as it is visited.
    3) The number of active, moving users.  Active users will continue
    to load content by seeing and using it.  It would otherwise be
    swapped out.  And 4) the aggressiveness of your cleanup routines,
    including things like swapping.  The more aggressively you clean
    up, the shorter the time that 'transient' memory (memory that is
    used briefly and discarded) will take up space after it is used.

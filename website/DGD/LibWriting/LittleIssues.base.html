  <h2> Miscellaneous Issues in MUD Library Authoring </h2>

  <p>
    Never keep the config file (the one ending in .dgd) or the
    swapfile inside the MUD code tree.  If you must do so, make sure
    there are access restrictions to keep hackers from being able to
    overwrite the files.  Changing either one can allow your MUD to
    masquerade as a different service, and potentially open different
    incoming ports.  If you're using the network package, it can
    easily cause your MUD to be usable as a relay or a zombie for a
    distributed attack on other systems.

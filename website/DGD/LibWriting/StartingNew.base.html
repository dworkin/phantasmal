<h2>Should You Write Your New MUD Library From Scratch?</h2>

<p>First off, you should probably be aware that starting from
scratch has prevented MUDs from advancing significantly since the
early 1980's. I've written a <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo3.phtml">previous rant</a> on
the subject, which I continue to stand by. Since MUD authors are
unwilling to use the work of others, an author who can write good
dynamic content will write a MUD with no interMUD support, a lousy
help system, and essentially every other feature done poorly. He
will plan to release a version with "all the trimmings", and it
will never be released. Future MUD authors will throw his work away
because it isn't complete, and they'll start from scratch on their
own, and have the same problem.</p>

<p>And so MUD Libraries will remain awful because nobody is willing
to put more than six months of hard effort into a five-to-ten-year
job. It could take less time than that, but only with a coordinated
team of skilled programmers with a good understanding of previous
work. Occasionally a coordinated team of skilled programmers starts
work on a MUD, but invariably not one of them has really read the
source code of more than one or two previous MUDs. As a result, the
work of Diku authors, LPC authors, MUSH authors and MOO authors is
never brought into a single codebase &mdash; no programmer is
familiar with all of their work, and nobody bothers to become so,
even though it's all available for free if you bother to look.</p>

<p>The best codebases, like SMAUG, are produced by improving an
existing codebase, cutting out its problems and adding good new
features. While it would be nice to produce a good new codebase on
a completely new design, nobody has ever done so in the MUD
community. Raw, decent new codebases that will (eventually) be
improved by other people to the point of being good seem to happen.
The DikuMUD codebase is a fine example.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a MUD will put together a good game with a so-so
codebase (Blood Dusk is the only example I can come up with
offhand) and then never release their code. Many groups start with
a good concept and say they'll release their code "as soon as it
works". At least 75% of these groups, and probably more than 90%,
never release anything. The MUD Library never works to their
satisfaction, or the effort stalls, and they don't release their
code after it fails to work, either. So all their effort turned out
to be for nothing. They never got any use out of it, and they never
released it, so it was all worthless to everybody, even the
authors.</p>

<p>But hey, maybe you're planning to never release your code, none
of it, back into the public domain. A few people manage to write
MUDs that way and run a decent game. Most of <i>them</i> fail, too,
mainly because they start from scratch. But your chances seem to be
higher than zero if you do it that way, so if you're doing that you
could start from scratch.</p>

<p>Statistically speaking, you're much, <i>much</i> better off
starting from somebody else's codebase. Either way, if you want the
MUD not to immediately go under, you should open it for testing and
<i>keep it running</i> as early as possible. Otherwise you won't
catch errors quickly, and the MUD won't just be not running... It
won't even be runnable, because your co-builders (or you) have
broken things and can't run the MUD to test them.</p>

<p>If you want to build a game, first and foremost, the best way is
to start with somebody else's code. If you want to build a good MUD
Library for other people's games, first and foremost, the best way
is still to start with somebody else's code. But, if what you want
is a rough library with a new concept, one that will eventually
influence others, then you may want to start from scratch.</p>

  <h2> Precompiling LPC Objects </h2>

  <p>
    If you're planning to precompile LPC objects, take a good look at
    dgd/src/lpc/Makefile in the DGD driver source.
    There are some commented-out lines in there that you can uncomment
    (while commenting others).  Doing so will precompile the kernel
    library if you compile DGD.  It's fairly easy to figure out.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're looking to precompile for the speed advantage, measure
    the code performance first.  Using a mostly-hardcoded tool in LPC
    like parse_string, implode(), or explode() can vastly improve your
    performance.  They're often better than a precompiling your LPC,
    and they're far more portable.  Measure, measure, measure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, before moving functionality into the driver itself and
    requiring all your users to run a patched DGD, first try an LPC
    solution, and then a precompiled LPC solution.  You're not likely
    to get even a two times difference between one and another.  DGD
    is already quite efficient, even when interpreted.  So when in
    doubt, measure.  When optimizing, optimize your algorithm first.
    It will make much, much more difference than optimizing what your
    code is compiled into.

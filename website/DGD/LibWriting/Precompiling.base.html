<h2>Precompiling LPC Objects</h2>

<p>If you're planning to precompile LPC objects, take a good look
at dgd/src/lpc/Makefile in the DGD driver source. There are some
commented-out lines in there that you can uncomment (while
commenting others). Doing so will precompile the kernel library if
you compile DGD. It's fairly easy to figure out.</p>

<p>If you're looking to precompile for the speed advantage, measure
the code performance first. Using a mostly-hardcoded tool in LPC
like parse_string, implode(), or explode() can vastly improve your
performance. They're often better than a precompiling your LPC, and
they're far more portable. Measure, measure, measure.</p>

<p>Similarly, before moving functionality into the driver itself
and requiring all your users to run a patched DGD, first try an LPC
solution, and then a precompiled LPC solution. You're not likely to
get even a two times difference between one and another. DGD is
already quite efficient, even when interpreted. So when in doubt,
measure. When optimizing, optimize your algorithm first. It will
make much, much more difference than optimizing what your code is
compiled into.</p>

  <h2> Precompiling LPC Objects </h2>

  <p>
    If you're planning to precompile LPC objects, take a good look at
    dgd&frasl;src&frasl;lpc&frasl;Makefile in the DGD driver source.
    There are some commented-out lines in there that you can uncomment
    (while commenting others).  Doing so will precompile the kernel
    library if you compile DGD.  It's fairly easy to figure out.

<h2>Writing an InterMUD3 Server in DGD</h2>

<p>InterMUD3 is a protocol for sending chat-type social commands between
MUDs, allowing you to message players on other MUDs, and to have shared
chat channels across more than one MUD. There are previous protocols for
the same, but InterMUD3 is the current frontrunner for new
implementations.</p>

<p>Like FTP, InterMUD3 protocol requires outgoing network connections,
so normally you'll need to apply the DGD network patch to implement an
InterMUD3 server, though it would be possible to write an external
InterMUD3 server, then have it make a connection to the DGD server and
relay all the appropriate information, thus defining your own "passive
InterMUD3" protocol. However, this would require significant additional
effort, and probably a lot of work in a language other than DGD.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="../external/I3Code.txt">Jason Cone's InterMUD3
daemon</a> on the <a href="../Programming/Code_Examples.html">page of
code examples</a>. However, it's not entirely complete, and requires the
network patch for DGD.</p>

<p>If you decide to implement InterMUD3, you'll want to very carefully
examine the <a href=
"http://cie.imaginary.com/protocols/intermud3.html">protocol
specification</a> for it.</p>

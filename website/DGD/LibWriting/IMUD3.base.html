<h2>Writing an InterMUD3 Server in DGD</h2>

<p>InterMUD3 is a protocol for sending chat-type social commands
between MUDs, allowing you to message players on other MUDs, and to
have shared chat channels across more than one MUD. There are
previous protocols for the same, but InterMUD3 is the current
frontrunner for new implementations.</p>

<p>Like FTP, InterMUD3 protocol requires outgoing network
connections, so normally you'll need to apply the DGD network patch
to implement an InterMUD3 server, though it would be possible to
write an external InterMUD3 server, then have it make a connection
to the DGD server and relay all the appropriate information, thus
defining your own "passive InterMUD3" protocol. However, this would
require significant additional effort, and probably a lot of work
in a language other than DGD.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="../external/I3Code.txt">Jason Cone's
InterMUD3 daemon</a> on the <a href=
"../Programming/Code_Examples.html">page of code examples</a>.
However, it's not entirely complete, and requires the network patch
for DGD.</p>

<p>If you decide to implement InterMUD3, you'll want to very
carefully examine the <a href=
"http://cie.imaginary.com/protocols/intermud3.html">protocol
specification</a> for it.</p>

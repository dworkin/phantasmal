  <h2> Writing an InterMUD3 Server in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    InterMUD3 is a protocol for sending chat-type social commands
    between MUDs, allowing you to message players on other MUDs, and
    to have shared chat channels across more than one MUD.  There are
    previous protocols for the same, but InterMUD3 is the current
    frontrunner for new implementations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like FTP, InterMUD3 protocol requires outgoing network
    connections, so normally you'll need to apply the DGD network
    patch to implement an InterMUD3 server, though it would be
    possible to write an external InterMUD3 server, then have it make
    a connection to the DGD server and relay all the appropriate
    information, thus defining your own &quot;passive InterMUD3&quot;
    protocol.  However, this would require significant additional
    effort, and probably a lot of work in a language other than DGD.

Subject: [DGD] [Melville] color and IMUD3
Message-ID: <010b01c1a5ae$f15979b0$07017a0a@hughesrae.co.uk>

Firstly, thanks to Erwin for replying on my behalf -- my reply got rejected
(or is awaiting approval, actually) because I replied from my work account.
:)  There are a couple of things you need to know about the link he posted.

Firstly, the e-mail addresses in there are all wrong! :)  I am no longer at
Middlesex University, and my bigfoot and crosswinds accounts no longer
exist.  If you do need to contact me and wrack my brain for hazy memories,
you'll need to do so at JTait@wyrddreams.demon.co.uk or
james.tait@morse.com.

Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, the IMUD3 Daemon (if you can call
it
that!) was written with a copy of the IMUD3 protocol specification by my
side.  This can be found at
http://cie.imaginary.com/protocols/intermud3.html and is well worth reading
through a couple of times before you get started.

Finally, it is a long time since I wrote the IMUD3 Daemon.  In fact, it's a
long time since I did any work with DGD, as I now have a full-time job
which
often requires long working hours, a fianc√©e to support, and, as such, very
little free time.  It was also written while I was a naive university
student, with very little thought for design, modularity, extensibility,
etc.  In short, it is very poorly implemented (in retrospect) and should
only really serve as a proof of concept.

Anyway, if you decide to take it on, good luck with it.  Have you had any
luck with getting a pre-patched binary for Win32?  Can anyone on the list
help?


Cheers,

JT (Oojmaflip@Wyrd Dreams, once upon a time. ;) )

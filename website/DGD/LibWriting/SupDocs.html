  <h3> DGD Documentation </h3>

  <p>
    Of course, you've already read the DGD documentation which comes
    in &quot;dgd/doc&quot; (<i>haven't</i> you?), but just in case
    I'll do a little overview.
  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Commercial: this file tells you about using DGD commercially.
	This is important only if you ever plan to make money off a
	DGD MUD.  <a href="../Skotos/CommercialUse.html">Making money
	off a DGD server</a> is involved and requires licensing.
	However, making money off most flavors of LPMUD is forbidden
	entirely by the license, so this is more generous of Dworkin
	than you think.  The exceptions are the GPL'd servers, pike
	and Shattered World.  Neither is quite the same language as
	DGD, but either could be worth looking into.
      </li>

      <li>
	Extensions: this tells you how to modify DGD itself in some
	specific, pretty clean ways.  Don't do this until you have a
	good grasp of everything you'll need for a MUDLib.  Even then,
	you'll want to be on the mailing list since this stuff isn't
	guaranteed to work right and operates very differently than
	you might think.
      </li>

      <li>
	Introduction: an excellent introduction to the interface
	between DGD and any given MUDLib.  You won't interact with
	this stuff directly, but it's good to know.  This is an
	excellent programmer's introduction to what a driver and an
	auto object are, and how DGD uses them.
      </li>

      <li>
	Platforms: getting DGD compiled in the first place.
	You've already done that, right?
      </li>

      <li>
	editor: help on using DGD's built-in editor.  You'll
	eventually want a better editing solution, but not necessarily
	coded into DGD or your MUDLib.  In general, getting your
	editor entirely on the client side is best, building it into
	your MUDLib is next-best, and building it directly into DGD is
	worst.  Feel free to ask Dworkin about this on the newsgroup,
	or just read through the archives and discover his opinions
	for yourself.
      </li>

      <li>
	parser: help on using DGD's built in parse_string facility.
	It's neat, it'll do good things, but it's not really relevant
	to a just-getting-started MUDLib.  It'll let you build fine
	features later, but first you'll need to get stuff up and
	running.
      </li>

      <li>
	The kfun directory: up-to-date documentation on DGD's
	interface (via the auto object) to your program.  This is
	roughly the same as documentation on OS system calls.  Your
	MUDLib's auto object can override any, all or none of them.
      </li>
    </ul>

Dworkin's documentation is like a good novel or classical textbooks: 
they are so dense with information that even after multiple readings and 
a high degree of proficiency with the system, a fresh read-through will 
yield new insights.

Subject: [DGD] Any advice?

I did spend some time trying to learn DGD without writing any code by 
examining the kernel lib.  For me, this didn't work, which is why I took 
the approach of writing nearly everything from scratch.  I can highly 
recommend the Phantasmal mudlib for some excellent utility classes (string 
functions, UNQ encoding/decoding, and a great help system are the features 
I used from Phantasmal), as well as the kernel auto object for some great 
utility functions.

This is a valid complaint.  I do intend to document DGD's LPC fully at
one point (the driver internals have less priority) but keep pushing
that moment forward.  It's not as if I am lacking other DGD things to
work on, of course.

Having said that, some things in DGD are just mind-bogglingly complex.
Take the string parser for instance -- it wasn't created to make
parsing easy, it was created to make parsing really efficient.  The
documentation for it I consider to be of good quality, but nevertheless
making a good parser with it is as hard, or perhaps harder, than doing
so in LPC.

Another example would be atomic functions.  I still wrestle to find a
good way of explaining what they are, which can be understood by
everyone.

Regards,
Dworkin

I did a modification which changes the directory structure KernelLIB will run
under, called reload.#.tar.gz
though the changes aren't documented as such, you could grep for the defines
in /include/krn.h which amount to almost all the changes.
It's available on dgd.illiji.net/downloads/mudlibs
and www.orpgs.com
Though if you mean the driver itself, I believe thats fairly undocumented as
such, and for most intents and purposes probably not recommended to modify to
any extent. I know its not even recommended to modify the Kernel heh.

Noah's phantasmal.sourceforge.com site is one of the better sources for
documentation on DGD, and believe is-here.com has some FAQ's and kfun docs.

If that helps at all, though neither of those document how/what to go about
changing the driver or kernel lib.

<h2>Writing an FTPD in DGD</h2>

<p>An FTPD can be an excellent alternative to providing your MUD
coders with telnet access to your server (which can be insecure).
You can either run an external FTPD which is restricted (via
chroot()) to a particular subset of your filesystem and has its own
restricted user list, or you can build an FTPD into your MUD and
handle the security problems there.</p>

<p>Since standard DGD doesn't allow outgoing network connections,
and standard FTP protocol requires them, you can't write an active
FTP server in unpatched DGD. You choices are to apply the network
patch to DGD or to write a passive-mode-only FTPD.</p>

<p>There are existing FTPD implementations in LPC, but none
specifically for DGD. Still, you can adapt the FTPD from, say,
TMI-2 to run under DGD, either with the network patch or by
removing all code that would require outgoing connections.</p>

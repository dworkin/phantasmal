  <h2> Writing an HTTPD in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    If you write an HTTPD that can read files in your MUD (as opposed
    to one that presents an entirely different file model, something
    it makes up), remember not to let people randomly get code out of
    your MUD directories.  Be sure to only send out the files you
    intend people to get.  Be careful to normalize filenames first
    (remove leading '..' paths, et cetera) so that nobody can fool you
    by using a different path format.  This helps to keep your HTTPD
    from causing security problems in your MUD.

    The RFC for HTTP 1.0 is <a

    It may be useful for your implementation efforts.

    To set cookies, you may find Javascript is useful.  The following script
    was obtained by Wes Connell off a Javascript help page:

  <pre>
&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to retrieve a cookie.
function getCookie(name){
var cname = name + "=";
var dc = document.cookie;
    if (dc.length &gt; 0) {
    begin = dc.indexOf(cname);
        if (begin != -1) {
        begin += cname.length;
        end = dc.indexOf(";", begin);
            if (end == -1) end = dc.length;
            return unescape(dc.substring(begin, end));
        }
    }
return null;
}

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to save a cookie.
function setCookie(name, value) {
document.cookie = name + "=" + escape(value) + "; path=&frasl;";
}

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to delete a cookie.
function delCookie(name) {
document.cookie = name + "=; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:01 GMT" +  "; path=&frasl;";
}
&frasl;&frasl;--&gt;

What I've done with my httpd code (and it might not be the best way to do it)
was to actually output some Javascript code that accesses the document object
normally. 

I actually got this Javascipt from some JS help page... author unknown.


I spit the Javascript out first then I call something like:

send_html_output("<script language="JavaScript">);
send_html_output("setCookie(\"ACCOUNTNAME\", account_name);");
send_html_output("setCookie(\"PASSWORD\", encrypted_password);");
send_html_output("</script>");

Then show other HTML stuff.

I haven't used this in any sort of production code so there may be serious 
flaws in the way I handle this. It worked for me though. :)

Good luck!

This is how I would have done it a month ago, but just recently I was
enlightened by a friend of mine. Different computers CAN share the same IP
number, so you could actually play from both computers after logging on with
either of them. So obviously identifying players only by their IP isn't the
best way to do it.

First decision you need to make is whether you want to build a
mudlib completely from scratch, or build on top of the kernel.
There is a great deal to be said for building over the kernel,
but speaking as someone who's trying to do it himself, it's
quite difficult. Docs do not exist in any great quantity. If
you build over the kernel, asking a lot of questions on this
list is probably the best move. It is on my task list to write
some docs on how to do it, but I have to learn how first :)

If you are not building over the kernel, best bet is to study
the existing libs, including Phantasmal (which I'm not familiar
with) and Melville (which I am), the latter having at least
some documentation and internal comments which may help.

Pretty much yes.

I'd avoid that. I play a couple games like that and the problem
of ensuring that your custom app compiles and runs under lots of
Windows systems and configurations, not to mention non-PC
environments, is a real drag.

I've looked fairly seriously at this. The short answer is yes, except
that the web browser interface has some serious limits. Standard
html will not allow push technology, and MUD type games need it
to implement "tell" and "say" commands, and to display the results
of one user's actions to the other users. You're probably looking
at writing some Java code to handle messages incoming to the player
(or supporting a telnet client within your web frame, or something
that allows the game server to push a message back to the user).
The advantage to using Java, though, is that you don't have to worry
about getting it running on each user's system. If they've got their
browser running, Java works too, at least until Microsoft can destroy
Java (don't get me started on that ;)

If I was doing this, I would unquestionably go with the web and
Java approach.

I will suggest, optimistically perhaps, that the best thing to do
would be to create a very minimal web interface mudlib for DGD,
put that into public circulation for people to play with and help
you debug, and then go to the big project.

You might want to take a look at a couple of Skotos games, in
particular, Castle Marrach and Grendel's Revenge. Both have gifs and
jpegs under client control.

Our basic technique is to have a pane for flowing text that is imbedded
inside an html page. This text pane can receive special commands that it
will send out to the DOM of the web page it sits inside. This allows us
to change the whole web page dynamically. We have three clients that use
this technique, an Active-X client that is based on Pueblo, a Java
client, and a Mozilla Javascript client.

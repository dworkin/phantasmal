<h2>Writing an HTTPD in DGD</h2>

<p>If you write an HTTPD that can read files in your MUD (as
opposed to one that presents an entirely different file model,
something it makes up), remember not to let people randomly get
code out of your MUD directories. Be sure to only send out the
files you intend people to get. Be careful to normalize filenames
first (remove leading '..' paths, et cetera) so that nobody can
fool you by using a different path format. This helps to keep your
HTTPD from causing security problems in your MUD.</p>

<p>You can also allow players to play over HTTP, or some related
protocol. If so, please remember <i>not</i> to identify your
players by IP address. Issues like firewalls and NAT can greatly
confuse your MUD server, causing multiple players to be treated as
one, or a player to suddenly lose connection when he appears to
change IP addresses. Cookies are one of several more reliable
tracking methods, though there are certainly others.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that standard HTTP does not allow 'push' code for
things like 'tell' and 'say', nor for sudden events like a creature
entering a room and attacking. For that reason, Java (or
Javascript?) or some more proprietary replacement like ActiveX may
be necessary to allow your MUD proper two-way interactivity.</p>

<p>More complex setups can work quite well, of course. Christopher
Allen describes the Skotos setup like this:</p>

<p style="color: #FF00C0">You might want to take a look at a couple
of Skotos games, in particular, Castle Marrach and Grendel's
Revenge. Both have gifs and jpegs under client control.</p>

<p style="color: #FF00C0">Our basic technique is to have a pane for
flowing text that is imbedded inside an html page. This text pane
can receive special commands that it will send out to the DOM of
the web page it sits inside. This allows us to change the whole web
page dynamically. We have three clients that use this technique, an
Active-X client that is based on Pueblo, a Java client, and a
Mozilla Javascript client.</p>

<p>The RFC for HTTP 1.0 is <a href=
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc1945.html">here</a>. It
may be useful for your implementation efforts.</p>

<p>To set cookies, you may find Javascript is useful. The following
script was obtained by Wes Connell off a Javascript help page:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to retrieve a cookie.
function getCookie(name){
var cname = name + "=";
var dc = document.cookie;
    if (dc.length &gt; 0) {
    begin = dc.indexOf(cname);
        if (begin != -1) {
        begin += cname.length;
        end = dc.indexOf(";", begin);
            if (end == -1) end = dc.length;
            return unescape(dc.substring(begin, end));
        }
    }
return null;
}

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to save a cookie.
function setCookie(name, value) {
document.cookie = name + "=" + escape(value) + "; path=&frasl;";
}

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to delete a cookie.
function delCookie(name) {
document.cookie = name + "=; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:01 GMT" +  "; path=&frasl;";
}
&frasl;&frasl;--&gt;
&lt;&frasl;script&gt;
  
</pre>

<p>Using the above, the following code can be included:</p>
<pre>
send_html_output("&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;);
send_html_output("setCookie(\"ACCOUNTNAME\", account_name);");
send_html_output("setCookie(\"PASSWORD\", encrypted_password);");
send_html_output("&lt;&frasl;script&gt;");

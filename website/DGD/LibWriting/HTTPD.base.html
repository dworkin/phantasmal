<h2>Writing an HTTPD in DGD</h2>

<p>If you write an HTTPD that can read files in your MUD (as opposed to
one that presents an entirely different file model, something it makes
up), remember not to let people randomly get code out of your MUD
directories. Be sure to only send out the files you intend people to
get. Be careful to normalize filenames first (remove leading '..' paths,
et cetera) so that nobody can fool you by using a different path format.
This helps to keep your HTTPD from causing security problems in your
MUD.</p>

<p>You can also allow players to play over HTTP, or some related
protocol. If so, please remember <i>not</i> to identify your players by
IP address. Issues like firewalls and NAT can greatly confuse your MUD
server, causing multiple players to be treated as one, or a player to
suddenly lose connection when he appears to change IP addresses. Cookies
are one of several more reliable tracking methods, though there are
certainly others.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that standard HTTP does not allow 'push' code for things
like 'tell' and 'say', nor for sudden events like a creature entering a
room and attacking. For that reason, Java (or Javascript?) or some more
proprietary replacement like ActiveX may be necessary to allow your MUD
proper two-way interactivity.</p>

<p>More complex setups can work quite well, of course. Christopher Allen
describes the Skotos setup like this:</p>

<p style="color: #FF00C0">You might want to take a look at a couple of
Skotos games, in particular, Castle Marrach and Grendel's Revenge. Both
have gifs and jpegs under client control.</p>

<p style="color: #FF00C0">Our basic technique is to have a pane for
flowing text that is imbedded inside an html page. This text pane can
receive special commands that it will send out to the DOM of the web
page it sits inside. This allows us to change the whole web page
dynamically. We have three clients that use this technique, an Active-X
client that is based on Pueblo, a Java client, and a Mozilla Javascript
client.</p>

<p>The RFC for HTTP 1.0 is <a href=
"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc1945.html">here</a>. It may be
useful for your implementation efforts.</p>

<p>To set cookies, you may find Javascript is useful. The following
script was obtained by Wes Connell off a Javascript help page:</p>
<pre>
&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!--

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to retrieve a cookie.
function getCookie(name){
var cname = name + "=";
var dc = document.cookie;
    if (dc.length &gt; 0) {
    begin = dc.indexOf(cname);
        if (begin != -1) {
        begin += cname.length;
        end = dc.indexOf(";", begin);
            if (end == -1) end = dc.length;
            return unescape(dc.substring(begin, end));
        }
    }
return null;
}

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to save a cookie.
function setCookie(name, value) {
document.cookie = name + "=" + escape(value) + "; path=&frasl;";
}

&frasl;&frasl; Use this function to delete a cookie.
function delCookie(name) {
document.cookie = name + "=; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:01 GMT" +  "; path=&frasl;";
}
&frasl;&frasl;--&gt;
&lt;&frasl;script&gt;
  </pre>

<p>Using the above, the following code can be included:</p>
<pre>
send_html_output("&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;);
send_html_output("setCookie(\"ACCOUNTNAME\", account_name);");
send_html_output("setCookie(\"PASSWORD\", encrypted_password);");
send_html_output("&lt;&frasl;script&gt;");

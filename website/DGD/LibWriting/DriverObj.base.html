Are you talking about the functions that DGD expects in the driver
object, or about the hooks that the kernel-lib provides?

The driver object is expected to provide certain functions, even if
those functions do (almost) nothing and are just placeholders.

The kernel-lib can be started without any modifications and you can
take it from there.

But note that in some mudlibs, it may be useful for the driver object
to inherit the auto object after all.  So the driver object can do that;
it just doesn't do it automatically.

The driver-object itself also needs to be compiled and for that DGD
needs to know what the standard include file, the include-directories
and the create function are (quite often you don't use it, but it _is_
possible to do something useful in there).

If you have a look at the driver-functions that DGD already supports
you'll see that you can do just about all of the above in LPC already
by adding some extra code in the driver object and the alternate
create function could be done by some special code in the auto object.

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

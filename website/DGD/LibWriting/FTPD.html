  <h2> Writing an FTPD in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    Since standard DGD doesn't allow outgoing network connections, and
    standard FTP protocol requires them, you can't write an active FTP
    server in unpatched DGD.  You choices are to apply the network
    patch to DGD or to write a passive-mode-only FTPD.

Don't give them telnet access just for editing purposes.  There are a
number of editors which will edit a remote file to which the user has
ftp access (vim and emacs come to mind).  This simplifies your problem
into simply providing ftp access.

There are a number of options here, some of them more satisfactory than
others.

1. Write an ftpd in LPC.  This has been done, and you should be able to
   find one and port it to DGD and whatever lib you are using.  It can
   use either the networking kfuns or the binary port.  Obviously you
   tie it into the mud's permission system, which is nice.  Downside is
   you need good LPC skills and a knowledge of the FTP protocol, or at 
   least a working subset of it.

2. Run a standard ftpd, preferably chroot'ed into the mud's main
   directory.  Hack the ftpd to use the mud's permissions by reading
   whatever format permissions are stored in.  This has been done
   before but presents some problems in terms of keeping the permissions
   logic in sync.

3. Run a standard ftpd, give all the coders an account without a useable
   shell with their home directories set to their home directory within
   the mud.  Preferably find an ftpd that will allow a configuration
   which limits users to their home directory or something similar.
   This should also be run chroot'ed.  The obvious drawback here is that
   the coders don't have the same access they do on the mud, although
   they can copy files around inside the mud, which works around most
   of these problems.

Those are some ideas anyway :).  If you're going to use a standard ftpd,
then please run it chroot'ed or run both it and the mud in something like
a FreeBSD jail(8).

  One problem with this is that you'll need to either use the (not
currently up-to-date) networking package for DGD or only implement passive
FTP.  The FTP protocol is old, and unfortunately requires making outgoing
connections.  It has trouble dealing with NAT, firewalls, etc for the same
reason (it works, it just gets special-cased by everybody which is ugly).
  Passive FTP is commonly available, but not every client does it
decently.  It's often not tested very thoroughly since pretty much every
"real" FTP server prefers to use active FTP.

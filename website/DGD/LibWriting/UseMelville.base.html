@@TITLE Using Melville@@

<h2>Should You Start From the Melville MUD Library?</h2>

<p>There are several pieces of code that you can start from when writing
your own MUD Library. One choice is Melville, written by MobyDick (aka
Stephen Schmidt). You should compare and contrast with other choices,
like the <a href="../Kernel">Kernel Library</a>, <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sf.net">Phantasmal</a>, and perhaps others like
<a href="http://mudos.org">Lima</a>, LDMUD, <a href=
"http://web.cold.org">ColdCore</a>, or even Diku-based MUDs like ROM,
Merc or <a href="http://www.circlemud.org">CircleMUD</a>.</p>

<h3>Why You'd Use It</h3>

<p>Many of these reasons are taken from a piece of email written by
David Jackson some time ago. While the email is getting older, the
reasons are still basically correct.</p>

<p>Melville may be a very minimal framework from which to operate, but
the structure for something very functional and very powerful is there.
This is a good thing. The code is very well commented, and it's very,
very easy to extend. For instance, David Jackson says: "I added
functional, working, and debugged code for doors in less than an
hour."</p>

<p>Most standard features are documented somewhere within the code, or
within the DGD documentation itself. Mobydick's coding may not be the
most elegant, but it is certainly very, very readable and easy to
follow. This is a good thing. Melville is getting older, and DGD is
advancing rapidly, so some newer features like LWOs, statedumps and
atomic functions aren't included, but that also helps to simplify the
code.</p>

<p>It's very easy to spot areas that you may want to extend it. This is
a good thing. Mobydick was wise enough to point out exactly where the
code might need to be extended, or where he simply did not feel
compelled to add functionality. This makes it very easy to gain a higher
grasp of what is going on in the lib. This is a very good thing.</p>

<h3>Why You Wouldn't Use It</h3>

<p>Melville's author actually suggests that it's now the wrong place to
start. He believes that the Kernel Library, or (better yet) something
based on it makes more sense. Melville was a good, powerful
state-of-the-art beginning when it was written, but its organization and
features are better for building a 1994-era MUD than a modern one.
Melville's structure is very familiar, but can be significantly limiting
if you don't want to build Yet Another LPMUD.</p>

<p>Melville also fails to take advantage of a number of powerful DGD
functions like additional AUTO objects and all the functionality
mentioned above as too new for Melville. Much of it would be more
difficult to retrofit into Melville's structure than it would be to
write new structure from scratch.</p>

<p>Similarly, Melville fails to have a lot of the structure that makes
the Kernel Library so powerful, and it would be very difficult to hack
that functionality into Melville.</p>

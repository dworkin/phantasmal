@@TITLE Using Melville@@

<h2>Should You Start From the Melville MUD Library?</h2>

<p>There are several pieces of code that you can start from when
writing your own MUD Library. One choice is Melville, written by
MobyDick (aka Stephen Schmidt). You should compare and contrast
with other choices, like the <a href="../Kernel">Kernel
Library</a>, <a href="http://phantasmal.sf.net">Phantasmal</a>, and
perhaps others like <a href="http://mudos.org">Lima</a>, LDMUD,
<a href="http://web.cold.org">ColdCore</a>, or even Diku-based MUDs
like ROM, Merc or <a href=
"http://www.circlemud.org">CircleMUD</a>.</p>

<h3>Why You'd Use It</h3>

<p>Many of these reasons are taken from a piece of email written by
David Jackson some time ago. While the email is getting older, the
reasons are still basically correct.</p>

<p>Melville may be a very minimal framework from which to operate,
but the structure for something very functional and very powerful
is there. This is a good thing. The code is very well commented,
and it's very, very easy to extend. For instance, David Jackson
says: "I added functional, working, and debugged code for doors in
less than an hour."</p>

<p>Most standard features are documented somewhere within the code,
or within the DGD documentation itself. Mobydick's coding may not
be the most elegant, but it is certainly very, very readable and
easy to follow. This is a good thing. Melville is getting older,
and DGD is advancing rapidly, so some newer features like LWOs,
statedumps and atomic functions aren't included, but that also
helps to simplify the code.</p>

<p>It's very easy to spot areas that you may want to extend it.
This is a good thing. Mobydick was wise enough to point out exactly
where the code might need to be extended, or where he simply did
not feel compelled to add functionality. This makes it very easy to
gain a higher grasp of what is going on in the lib. This is a very
good thing.</p>

<h3>Why You Wouldn't Use It</h3>

<p>Melville's author actually suggests that it's now the wrong
place to start. He believes that the Kernel Library, or (better
yet) something based on it makes more sense. Melville was a good,
powerful state-of-the-art beginning when it was written, but its
organization and features are better for building a 1994-era MUD
than a modern one. Melville's structure is very familiar, but can
be significantly limiting if you don't want to build Yet Another
LPMUD.</p>

<p>Melville also fails to take advantage of a number of powerful
DGD functions like additional AUTO objects and all the
functionality mentioned above as too new for Melville. Much of it
would be more difficult to retrofit into Melville's structure than
it would be to write new structure from scratch.</p>

<p>Similarly, Melville fails to have a lot of the structure that
makes the Kernel Library so powerful, and it would be very
difficult to hack that functionality into Melville.</p>

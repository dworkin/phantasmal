  <h2> Using an Object Database </h2>

  <p>
    A question that appears frequently on the MUD-Dev list and
    occasionally on the DGD list is whether it would be a good idea to
    use an external database to store MUD objects and have DGD access
    that database rather than storing the objects itself.

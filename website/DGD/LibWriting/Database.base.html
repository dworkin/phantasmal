<h2>Using an Object Database</h2>

<p>A question that appears frequently on the MUD-Dev list and
occasionally on the DGD list is whether it would be a good idea to
use an external database to store MUD objects and have DGD access
that database. Normally, DGD stores the objects itself in its own
internal database.</p>

<p>(Note: you might not 'really' mean a database. Maybe you're just
talking about having a bunch of master data and then instances of
it, like if you had a 'database' of monsters and then all your
actual in-MUD critters pointed to that master list. If so, skip
down to 'Internal Databases' and skip the rest of this page.)</p>

<h3>Storing DGD Objects in a Database</h3>

<p>You might quite reasonably think, 'well, MySQL or PostgreSQL
must be better databases than DGD.' And, in general, you'd be
right. However, there are some specific integration issues with
DGD's dialect of LPC that can cause problems.</p>

<p>There's a reason that DGD doesn't normally do callout to other
languages. DGD's LPC dialect has features that are very difficult
to implement cross-language. For instance, rlimits() and atomic
functions are found in basically no other language, and are not
part of almost any cross-language callout interface. To use an
external database, you'd need to create a module for the DGD server
to handle interruptions gracefully, and figure out how many ticks
different database operations took, and convert the errors they
raised to DGD errors. That's not impossible, but it's quite
difficult. You could declare that rlimits() and atomic functions
don't work correctly for database operations. But since those
features are all about guaranteeing uniform behavior in worst
cases, that means you're giving up some of DGD's most powerful and
compelling features.</p>

<p>Another of DGD's unique features, upgrade-in-place, may present
difficulties. Since DGD can have multiple versions of the same
object with different code and different behavior, you must figure
out how (and whether) to represent that in the external database's
data. It's possible to reflect that by recording the issue number
of each object's code, and being able to look up objects by issue
number in order to call the appropriate function. However, this
will require extensive and subtle changes to your object daemon. If
you don't know what any of this means (and most people don't), just
believe me that you will sometimes get weird behavior from DGD if
you don't understand its upgrade-in-place mechanism <i>very</i>
well and interact with it carefully. Being able to recompile an
object on the fly has some potentially sticky consequences.</p>

<p>You could just store all DGD objects as DGD objects and make
them query their field data out of the database. That will give you
the worst of the two behaviors in most cases, though, and require a
<i>lot</i> of database queries, which won't give you good database
performance. Databases usually prefer a small number of larger
queries so that they can optimize properly.</p>

<p>It's quite possible to do all this, but it's another reason that
DGD is simply a poor fit for the idea of storing objects in an
external database. The fact that DGD already stores them so well
and so quickly means that the possible benefit of using an external
database is much smaller as well. In general, DGD is simply poorly
suited to the use of an external database.</p>

<p>Dworkin has mentioned the possibility of eventually modifying
DGD to be able to use an external object database. However, he's
not planning to do it at <i>least</i> until multiprocessor support
is done. When&frasl;if DGD is upgraded that way, the 'poor fit'
comments above may be obsolete. Then again, they may not.</p>

<h3>Non-LPC Information Databases</h3>

<p>You can get around some problems by not storing each DGD object
individually in a database, but just querying big blocks of
information in less-structured form in them. This is possible, but
is essentially using the database as an external server, one on
which no actual LPC objects are stored. This is useful, for
instance, if web pages are there and DGD will be looking at them
and maybe processing or serving them, but will not be upgrading
them directly or otherwise modifying them as LPC objects. In that
case, the database can be accessed like any other external server.
Doing so may require the network patch if outgoing connections must
be made from the DGD server.</p>

<p>The problem here is that you still need to do all the usual
management of DGD objects, and that's where you're storing almost
everything. Anything that's in a DGD object isn't in the database,
so you can't do big complicated queries on most of your MUD's
information. You're just storing some other random stuff in a
database. It works fine, but it probably won't do what you want it
to.</p>

<h3>Internal Databases</h3>

<p>Well, what about a database written in LPC? You could have an
object that redirects all calls to get descriptions or other
textual data to a large database daemon. Would this cut down on
memory and increase processor use?</p>

<p>Usually, yes. Some considerations:</p>

<p>DGD makes sure that strings are shared within objects.
Constructed strings (such as the results of string addition or
taking a substring) are not shared with identical strings created
in a different manner until the object is swapped out. Basically,
if you want to be sure you don't have lots of copies of the same
string, swap the object(s) out. Normally you don't need to manually
do this, it'll get done for you reasonably quickly.</p>

<p>Since DGD does string sharing for you, you may get less benefit
from doing your own string sharing than you think. When DGD is
doing this well, it does it better than you can.</p>

<p>Putting many shared strings in a single object creates a huge
object that would have to be in memory all the time, quite possibly
&lt;increasing&gt; memory use, even though it would decrease the
total space (memory plus disk) used. So if you're going to make an
LPC in-memory database, make sure to distribute it across many DGD
objects, not just a few. That way only the currently active objects
need to be in your server's memory at a given time.</p>

<h3>Simple Cases</h3>

<p>So what if you're here because you think it'd be cool to have a
master list of monsters or objects or rooms and just return
references to that shared information? Well, for starters you
probably didn't understand much of the above. It's <i>way</i> more
than you need.</p>

<p>Just returning the master copy of the string or array every time
will do pretty well for you. It'll take <i>very</i> little more CPU
time, and you'll save a lot of memory. It's a good trade-off. Make
sure each of your master objects is its own DGD object (note: this
is not the same thing as the master object of a clone, and using
clones won't work here). Basically, don't make a big list of short
descriptions and a big list of long descriptions and so on, and
keep them all in arrays. If you do, the whole array will need to be
in memory all the time. Far better to keep the data per-monster,
with each master monster object having a short, a long, some combat
statistics, and so on. Then only the monsters you're using need to
be in memory.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing with objects or rooms, which would be
good if you're going to have a lot of some object (rocks or swords,
say), or if you're going to make a procedural wilderness for the
players to wander through. The more copies you'll have of the
objects in question, the better an idea this is.</p>

<p>Note that in the 'procedural wilderness' thing there's a whole
other set of questions about whether you have rooms existing <i>at
all</i> when players aren't in them. That's beyond the scope of
this specific document. But yes, it's a good question and there are
various interesting answers to it.</p>

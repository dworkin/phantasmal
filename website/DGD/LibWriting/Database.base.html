<h2>Using an Object Database</h2>

<p>A question that appears frequently on the MUD-Dev list and
occasionally on the DGD list is whether it would be a good idea to use
an external database to store MUD objects and have DGD access that
database. Normally, DGD stores the objects itself in its own internal
database.</p>

<p>(Note: you might not 'really' mean a database. Maybe you're just
talking about having a bunch of master data and then instances of it,
like if you had a 'database' of monsters and then all your actual in-MUD
critters pointed to that master list. If so, skip down to 'Internal
Databases' and skip the rest of this page.)</p>

<h3>Storing DGD Objects in a Database</h3>

<p>You might quite reasonably think, 'well, MySQL or PostgreSQL must be
better databases than DGD.' And, in general, you'd be right. However,
there are some specific integration issues with DGD's dialect of LPC
that can cause problems.</p>

<p>There's a reason that DGD doesn't normally do callout to other
languages. DGD's LPC dialect has features that are very difficult to
implement cross-language. For instance, rlimits() and atomic functions
are found in basically no other language, and are not part of almost any
cross-language callout interface. To use an external database, you'd
need to create a module for the DGD server to handle interruptions
gracefully, and figure out how many ticks different database operations
took, and convert the errors they raised to DGD errors. That's not
impossible, but it's quite difficult. You could declare that rlimits()
and atomic functions don't work correctly for database operations. But
since those features are all about guaranteeing uniform behavior in
worst cases, that means you're giving up some of DGD's most powerful and
compelling features.</p>

<p>Another of DGD's unique features, upgrade-in-place, may present
difficulties. Since DGD can have multiple versions of the same object
with different code and different behavior, you must figure out how (and
whether) to represent that in the external database's data. It's
possible to reflect that by recording the issue number of each object's
code, and being able to look up objects by issue number in order to call
the appropriate function. However, this will require extensive and
subtle changes to your object daemon. If you don't know what any of this
means (and most people don't), just believe me that you will sometimes
get weird behavior from DGD if you don't understand its upgrade-in-place
mechanism <i>very</i> well and interact with it carefully. Being able to
recompile an object on the fly has some potentially sticky
consequences.</p>

<p>You could just store all DGD objects as DGD objects and make them
query their field data out of the database. That will give you the worst
of the two behaviors in most cases, though, and require a <i>lot</i> of
database queries, which won't give you good database performance.
Databases usually prefer a small number of larger queries so that they
can optimize properly.</p>

<p>It's quite possible to do all this, but it's another reason that DGD
is simply a poor fit for the idea of storing objects in an external
database. The fact that DGD already stores them so well and so quickly
means that the possible benefit of using an external database is much
smaller as well. In general, DGD is simply poorly suited to the use of
an external database.</p>

<p>Dworkin has mentioned the possibility of eventually modifying DGD to
be able to use an external object database. However, he's not planning
to do it at <i>least</i> until multiprocessor support is done.
When&frasl;if DGD is upgraded that way, the 'poor fit' comments above
may be obsolete. Then again, they may not.</p>

<h3>Non-LPC Information Databases</h3>

<p>You can get around some problems by not storing each DGD object
individually in a database, but just querying big blocks of information
in less-structured form in them. This is possible, but is essentially
using the database as an external server, one on which no actual LPC
objects are stored. This is useful, for instance, if web pages are there
and DGD will be looking at them and maybe processing or serving them,
but will not be upgrading them directly or otherwise modifying them as
LPC objects. In that case, the database can be accessed like any other
external server. Doing so may require the network patch if outgoing
connections must be made from the DGD server.</p>

<p>The problem here is that you still need to do all the usual
management of DGD objects, and that's where you're storing almost
everything. Anything that's in a DGD object isn't in the database, so
you can't do big complicated queries on most of your MUD's information.
You're just storing some other random stuff in a database. It works
fine, but it probably won't do what you want it to.</p>

<h3>Internal Databases</h3>

<p>Well, what about a database written in LPC? You could have an object
that redirects all calls to get descriptions or other textual data to a
large database daemon. Would this cut down on memory and increase
processor use?</p>

<p>Usually, yes. Some considerations:</p>

<p>DGD makes sure that strings are shared within objects. Constructed
strings (such as the results of string addition or taking a substring)
are not shared with identical strings created in a different manner
until the object is swapped out. Basically, if you want to be sure you
don't have lots of copies of the same string, swap the object(s) out.
Normally you don't need to manually do this, it'll get done for you
reasonably quickly.</p>

<p>Since DGD does string sharing for you, you may get less benefit from
doing your own string sharing than you think. When DGD is doing this
well, it does it better than you can.</p>

<p>Putting many shared strings in a single object creates a huge object
that would have to be in memory all the time, quite possibly
&lt;increasing&gt; memory use, even though it would decrease the total
space (memory plus disk) used. So if you're going to make an LPC
in-memory database, make sure to distribute it across many DGD objects,
not just a few. That way only the currently active objects need to be in
your server's memory at a given time.</p>

<h3>Simple Cases</h3>

<p>So what if you're here because you think it'd be cool to have a
master list of monsters or objects or rooms and just return references
to that shared information? Well, for starters you probably didn't
understand much of the above. It's <i>way</i> more than you need.</p>

<p>Just returning the master copy of the string or array every time will
do pretty well for you. It'll take <i>very</i> little more CPU time, and
you'll save a lot of memory. It's a good trade-off. Make sure each of
your master objects is its own DGD object (note: this is not the same
thing as the master object of a clone, and using clones won't work
here). Basically, don't make a big list of short descriptions and a big
list of long descriptions and so on, and keep them all in arrays. If you
do, the whole array will need to be in memory all the time. Far better
to keep the data per-monster, with each master monster object having a
short, a long, some combat statistics, and so on. Then only the monsters
you're using need to be in memory.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing with objects or rooms, which would be good
if you're going to have a lot of some object (rocks or swords, say), or
if you're going to make a procedural wilderness for the players to
wander through. The more copies you'll have of the objects in question,
the better an idea this is.</p>

<p>Note that in the 'procedural wilderness' thing there's a whole other
set of questions about whether you have rooms existing <i>at all</i>
when players aren't in them. That's beyond the scope of this specific
document. But yes, it's a good question and there are various
interesting answers to it.</p>

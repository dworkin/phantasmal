  <h2> Should You Start From the Melville MUD Library? </h2>

  <p>
    There are several pieces of code that you can start from when
    writing your own MUD Library.  One choice is Melville, written by
    MobyDick (aka Stephen Schmidt).  You should compare and contrast
    with other choices, like the <a href="../Kernel">Kernel
    Library</a>, <a href="http://phantasmal.sf.net">Phantasmal</a>,
    and perhaps others like <a href="http://mudos.org">Lima</a>,
    LDMUD, <a href="http://web.cold.org">ColdCore</a>, or even
    Diku-based MUDs like ROM, Merc or <a
    href="http://www.circlemud.org">CircleMUD</a>.
  </p>

  <h3> Why You'd Use It </h3>

  <p>
    Many of these reasons are taken from a piece of email written by David
    Jackson some time ago.  While the email is getting older, the
    reasons are still basically correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    Melville may be a very minimal framework from which to operate,
    but the structure for something very functional and very powerful
    is there.  This is a good thing.  The code is very well commented,
    and it's very, very easy to extend.  For instance, David Jackson
    says: &quot;I added functional, working, and debugged code for
    doors in less than an hour.&quot;
  </p>

  <p>
    Most standard features are documented somewhere within the code,
    or within the DGD documentation itself.  Mobydick's coding may not
    be the most elegant, but it is certainly very, very readable and
    easy to follow.  This is a good thing.  Melville is getting older,
    and DGD is advancing rapidly, so some newer features like LWOs,
    statedumps and atomic functions aren't included, but that also
    helps to simplify the code.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's very easy to spot areas that you may want to extend it.  This
    is a good thing.  Mobydick was wise enough to point out exactly
    where the code might need to be extended, or where he simply did
    not feel compelled to add functionality.  This makes it very easy
    to gain a higher grasp of what is going on in the lib.  This is a
    very good thing.
  </p>

  <h3> Why You Wouldn't Use It </h3>

  <p>
    Melville's author actually suggests that it's now the wrong place
    to start.  He believes that the Kernel Library, or (better yet)
    something based on it makes more sense.  Melville was a good,
    powerful state-of-the-art beginning when it was written, but its
    organization and features are better for building a 1994-era MUD
    than a modern one.  Melville's structure is very familiar, but can
    be significantly limiting if you don't want to build Yet Another
    LPMUD.
  </p>

  <p>
    Melville also fails to take advantage of a number of powerful DGD
    functions like additional AUTO objects and all the functionality
    mentioned above as too new for Melville.  Much of it would be more
    difficult to retrofit into Melville's structure than it would be
    to write new structure from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, Melville fails to have a lot of the structure that
    makes the Kernel Library so powerful, and it would be very
    difficult to hack that functionality into Melville.

Subject: [DGD] Cancelling input_to()

--Apple-Mail-2-417127595
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset=US-ASCII;
	format=flowed

In user.c of the Melville lib there should be a variable for the input 
object and input function (even if you don't use the lib, it should be 
the basic idea) :

object input_obj;	/* object for input_to */
static string input_func; /* function for input_to */

If you can place a function in the user object that clears the object, 
you can safely get out of the input_to (Look at receive_message() ).
Then just call the function in whatever object you want. You might want 
to place security restrictions on this function since it can adversely 
effect things if you rely heavily on input_to's.  And yes, it seems 
possible to do it with a time_out function, but I've never tried it, 
nor the answer given above.
However, I haven't tested this, so I can't be sure.

  <h2> Should You Release the Source to Your MUD Library? </h2>

  <p>
    This has been a hotly-debated topic for quite a long time
    throughout the MUD community.  Obviously, at some level it's a
    matter of choice.  But there has been a lot of good debate on the
    subject, and it's worth summarizing it to help avoid some of the
    repetition that usually dominates mailing-list discussion on the
    topic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reasons that Releasing is a Good Idea:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> You get to contribute to something much greater than just your own
      MUD </li>
    <li> DGD is severely lacking in functional, usable, and game-oriented
      mudlibs </li>
    <li> You could potentially benefit from those people that add new
      functionality to your source. </li>
    <li> Much bigger pool of users to draw from as far as tracking bugs
      and playtesting </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Reasons that Releasing is a Bad Idea:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Harder to find time for your own MUD due to MUDLib users asking
      for their own maintenance and changes </li>
    <li> You may lose all functional uniqueness due to numerous clones
      of your MUD </li>
    <li> Open to subjective public criticism on design paradigms (not
      really a problem, just an annoyance) </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> The 'Stock MUD' Argument </h3>

  <p>
    If you release a reasonably runnable MUD that people use, you'll
    find that the areas you supply are used as stock areas.  It's not
    really avoidable.  Is that a good or a bad thing?
  </p>

  <p>
    If you distributed a library with no predefined 'areas' then you
    could largely avoid this.  But is it bad to be recognizable in
    terms of the feel of the library?  For players it's a good thing,
    since familiar means comfortable as a rule.  However, it's not
    clear that beginner 'stock' areas are as valuable as say, a known,
    common set of commands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dworkin's suggestion is to release only part of your mudlib.
    Include the base classes, but not the actual rooms and objects.
    That way you won't have to fear the 100 identical clones.  Just
    include a few example rooms with a few example monsters (adjust to
    whatever your mudlib actually contains).  This suggestion can be
    annoying to initially set up since you'll need a release process
    that strips out the appropriate files.  However, once you have it
    in place, it avoids other people cloning your MUD unless they can
    rewrite a *lot* of game-specific code.
  </p>

  <h3> &quot;I'll Release When It Works&quot; Syndrome </h3>

  <p>
    I know of more DGD MUD Libraries that have abandoned development,
    never released, than have ever been released in total for DGD.  Of
    those libraries, all but two or three were going to release code
    as soon as it worked correctly.  When they had a release that
    satisfied them, they were going to make sure everybody could use
    it.  Not one of them ever released a line of code.  Their good ideas,
    their starting MUD code, every line of text and code is gone.
  </p>

  <p>
    John McKenna 'released' his &quot;Inferno&quot; MUD Library when I
    found it on an FTP server, almost by accident, and asked if I
    could link to it.  He didn't send out links publicly, to my
    knowledge.  He certainly didn't intend it to be broadly used.  But
    by agreeing to let me link to it, he contributed more to the
    current DGD community than every one of the MUDLib efforts that
    were abandoned unreleased.  More than all of them put together.
    And all he ever contributed was an example MUDLib, and not one
    that very many people look at.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're writing a MUD Library and you're planning to release
    code, please, please don't wait until it works.  If you do,
    chances are very good that we'll never see a line of your code,
    ever.  You might just contribute one decent subsystem of your MUD
    (Phantasmal's HelpD and I/O have both been used in other MUDs long
    before Phantasmal was playable).  But even if that's all anybody
    ever sees, you've still contributed <i>something</i>.  Are you
    really that dedicated to making sure all of your effort is lost
    forever?
  </p>

  <h3> Maintenance and Technical Support </h3>

  <p>
    Some people worry that if they release their MUD Library code,
    they'll have to provide technical support to all the people who
    want to use it.  This is a valid concern.  However, you'll find
    that you can always tell them to bugger off, particularly if
    you've written decent documentation.  However, the success of your
    MUD Library in the world at large will absolutely depend on your
    willingness to provide support to developers who try to use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dworkin says: use a DGD-like policy with regard to changes: make
    clear that you will be very happy with bugfixes, but will only
    include those &quot;enhancements&quot; that you yourself like.
  </p>

  <h3> Commentary From People Who Have Released </h3>

  <p>
    George Reese, author of the NightMare MUDLib (LPMUD, but not for
    DGD), has this to say:
  </p>

  <span style="color: #FF0080">

    <p>
      [People contributing new features] does not happen much at the
      mudlib level.  The mudlib is where people are differentiating
      themselves heavily.  Of the things I received for NM, only a
      couple ever made it into the distribution either because the
      ideas were so peculiar or the code sucked so bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't count on [a larger pool of testers] at the mudlib level :)
      95% of all bug reports are useless.  They are generally people
      misusing the lib or who simply don't know a bug from a hole in
      their head.  The other 5% are useful, but drowned out in the
      noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      [Attention being focused on lib development, not MUD
      development] is actually a plus, IMHO.  But it assumes you have
      separated the duties of running the mud into taking care of the
      lib and those who take care of the game.  Specifically, it
      allows you to view features people are asking for *on the mud*
      in a more generic context and thus allows you to come up with
      more flexible solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      [Other people cloning your MUD] is a HUGE problem... especially
      a year or two down the road.  More specifically, every mud has
      the problem of player X disagrees with the admins and declares
      he or she will start their own mud.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guess what.  If your mudlib is being publically distributed, not
      only can they start their own mud, but they can start one JUST
      LIKE yours.  And then they can come back to your mud and say
      &quot;we have started a mud just like [yours], except it is run
      by players who remember what it is like to be a player&quot; (as
      if you somehow don't have a clue).
    </p>

    <p>
      This is 90% of why I removed NM from distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subjective criticism is not the problem.  It is the pot shots.
      Especially from people who don't have a clue.  You will have a
      bit of a honeymoon for a while on this one though since you will
      be the only developed game lib for DGD.
    </p>

    <p>
      And don't forget having to provide tech support for people using
      the lib!
    </p>

    <p>
      I think the physical area is much more important than the actual
      lib.  The lib only determine how easily you can accomplish what
      is possible without affecting existing systems.  It cannot make
      you more creative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is if you get the situation [of] people intent on
      copying your mud.  Having the same mudlib makes it much easier
      to do so, even if you do not release the main town and such.

<h2>Cleaning Up Stray Objects</h2>

<p>If you're running a persistent MUD, chances are good that you'll
occasionally get a stray object sitting around, something that's no
longer useful, and may never have been useful. You'd like to get
rid of objects like that because otherwise they can stick around
for (quite literally) years. How can you do it?</p>

<p>The Kernel Library has some tools that you may want to use, or
may just want to duplicate for your own MUD. For instance, it has a
daemon called ObjRegD, which keeps a list of every clone and who
owns it. That allows authorized users to look through the lists and
get rid of old clones that are no longer in use, if they can figure
out whether it's being used.</p>

<p>In addition to the ObjRegD, it's possible in extreme or
desperate cases to parse through a statedump. You could also verify
the contents of your object management code by reading the
statedump, if necessary... Any disagreement between them means a
bug in your code. The statedump has a fixed format, and the code
that writes and parses it (the DGD server) is open to you, so you
can verify that format easily enough. Richard Braakman did this
with the early DGD 1.1.X dumpfile format.</p>

<h3>Garbage Collection</h3>

<p>Your arrays, mappings and LWOs are all garbage-collected. That
means they'll go away, even circular structures of them,
automatically. Clones, however, are <i>not</i> garbage collected.
In some sense it's impossible to lose the last reference to a clone
because find_object() can always potentially return it.</p>

<h3>Quotas</h3>

<p>It's often a good idea to enforce quotas on how many LPC objects
and how much memory a given administrator can use. By doing that,
and allowing the administrator to list what objects he is currently
being 'billed' for (using the ObjRegD above, presumably), you can
have administrators do much of your cleanup for you. Periodic
warnings for admins that are near their quota is a good way to make
them clean up <i>before</i> they hit the actual limit and things
start to go wrong.</p>

<h3>Heuristics</h3>

<p>What might you want to check for to determine if an object is
unused? Well, you can see who owns it &mdash; it's possible that
you'll want to get rid of every object created by a now-inactive
administrator when he leaves. However, you might want to first
check the objects and make sure they aren't in active zones. That
administrator might have done some building you weren't aware of.
Those objects can first be transferred to the ownership of a
different administrator, and then all the old admin's objects can
be purged.</p>

<p>You could keep track of how recently an object has been
referenced. If you update a time counter every time an object is
picked up or used, you can determine what objects are more likely
to be missed if they disappear. Then you can look through the
least-used objects by hand and eliminate any that seem superfluous.
However, this method has some pitfalls: make sure that objects like
statues in highly-trafficked areas (which are seen often but almost
never used) will not be marked as unused. If an object is seen
often, you'll want to keep it. Similarly, an active player may want
to keep a 'buried treasure' somewhere out of the way where other
players can't find it. If you keep track of object owners, it may
be easier to never get rid of an object owned by a currently-active
player.</p>

<p>To avoid problems like the above, you might simply never get rid
of any 'physical' object in a player-accessible zone of the MUD.
That will make it easier to track down only unused 'virtual'
objects, or objects with no 'physical' location.</p>

<p>It's also possible to have a 'testing' flag on objects in zones
that haven't been opened yet. That allows you to destruct them if
they enter the game proper, but also allows you to destruct any
'spare' clones of them that people are carrying (especially
non-admin characters!) if you need the space.</p>

<p>It's possible to use the status() kfun to get the most recent
stored size of an object. If you're trying to reduce the in-RAM
footprint of your MUD rather than just getting rid of the largest
number of (possibly small) objects, you might want to get a listing
of objects ranked by size, which will let you optimize or remove
the largest objects. Note that this doesn't give the exact current
size, it just gives the size the last time the object was swapped
to disk.</p>

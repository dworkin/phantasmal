  <h1> So You Want to Write a MUDLib </h1>

  <p>
    I'm assuming you already know basically what DGD is.  I'm assuming
    you already know what a MUDLib is.  If you don't, please carefully
    read the <a href="http://cie.imaginary.com/LPMud/lpmud_faq.html">
    LPMUD FAQ</a> and look up stuff on the web until you've got a
    clear idea what a driver and a MUDLib are, and whether LPC is a
    language you'd like to learn more about.
  </p>

  <p>
    That last bit is important.  If you're not much of a programmer,
    there's a serious chance that DGD isn't for you.  It's solid,
    secure and well-written.  The <a
    href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> folks use it, and that's
    high praise indeed!  But it's also very much designed for
    programmers.  If you're up for learning the basics of LPC but
    you're not much of a programmer, perhaps Amylaar or LDMUD will be
    easier for you.  Or go for something like <a
    href="http://www.mudos.org">MudOS</a>, <a
    href="http://www.circlemud.org">CircleMUD</a>, or any of the other
    fine MUD source code bases out there.  But if you're a good
    programmer, or if you're willing to sweat blood to learn, read on!

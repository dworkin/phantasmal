<h1>So You Want to Write a MUDLib</h1>

<p>I'm assuming you already know basically what DGD is. I'm assuming you
already know what a MUDLib is. If you don't, please carefully read the
<a href="http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud-faq.htm">LPMUD FAQ</a> and look up
stuff on the web until you've got a clear idea what a driver and a
MUDLib are, and whether LPC is a language you'd like to learn more
about.</p>

<p>That last bit is important. If you're not much of a programmer,
there's a serious chance that DGD isn't for you. It's solid, secure and
well-written. The <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> folks use
it, and that's high praise indeed! But it's also very much designed for
programmers. It will require significant programming to get a DGD-based
server running properly, because DGD starts you off with much less
already done, as do its various available MUD libraries.</p>

<p>In return for doing less for you, DGD offers a lot of uncommon and
powerful language features like <a href=
"../Programming/AtomicFuncs.html">atomic functions</a>, <a href=
"../Operation/Swapping.html">constant swapping</a>, <a href=
"../Operation/StateDumps.html">state dumps</a>, and <a href=
"../Programming/Parse_String.html">parse_string</a>. However, those
features are often hard to understand and use, so they may require even
<i>more</i> programming ability than if they didn't exist. You'll get a
better final result, but it might not be easy to get it.</p>

<p>If you're up for learning the basics of LPC but you're not much of a
programmer, perhaps MudOS or LDMUD will be easier for you. Certainly
both supply much more of a base to start your MUD from. You might be
happier becoming a builder on an existing LPMUD. Or go for something
like <a href="http://www.game.org/smaug">SMAUG</a>, <a href=
"http://www.circlemud.org">CircleMUD</a>, or any of the other fine MUD
codebases out there. But if you're a dedicated programmer, or if you're
willing to sweat blood to learn, read on!</p>

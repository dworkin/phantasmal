  <h3> DGD Documentation </h3>

  <p>
    Of course, you've already read the DGD documentation which comes
    in &quot;dgd/doc&quot; (<i>haven't</i> you?), but just in case
    I'll do a little overview.
  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Commercial: this file tells you about using DGD commercially.
	This is important only if you ever plan to make money off a
	DGD MUD.  <a href="../Skotos/CommercialUse.html">Making money
	off a DGD server</a> is involved and requires licensing.
	However, making money off most flavors of LPMUD is forbidden
	entirely by the license, so this is more generous of Dworkin
	than you think.  The exceptions are the GPL'd servers, pike
	and Shattered World.  Neither is quite the same language as
	DGD, but either could be worth looking into.
      </li>

      <li>
	Extensions: this tells you how to modify DGD itself in some
	specific, pretty clean ways.  Don't do this until you have a
	good grasp of everything you'll need for a MUDLib.  Even then,
	you'll want to be on the mailing list since this stuff isn't
	guaranteed to work right and operates very differently than
	you might think.
      </li>

      <li>
	Introduction: an excellent introduction to the interface
	between DGD and any given MUDLib.  You won't interact with
	this stuff directly, but it's good to know.  This is an
	excellent programmer's introduction to what a driver and an
	auto object are, and how DGD uses them.
      </li>

      <li>
	Platforms: getting DGD compiled in the first place.
	You've already done that, right?
      </li>

      <li>
	editor: help on using DGD's built-in editor.  You'll
	eventually want a better editing solution, but not necessarily
	coded into DGD or your MUDLib.  In general, getting your
	editor entirely on the client side is best, building it into
	your MUDLib is next-best, and building it directly into DGD is
	worst.  Feel free to ask Dworkin about this on the newsgroup,
	or just read through the archives and discover his opinions
	for yourself.
      </li>

      <li>
	parser: help on using DGD's built in parse_string facility.
	It's neat, it'll do good things, but it's not really relevant
	to a just-getting-started MUDLib.  It'll let you build fine
	features later, but first you'll need to get stuff up and
	running.
      </li>

      <li>
	The kfun directory: up-to-date documentation on DGD's
	interface (via the auto object) to your program.  This is
	roughly the same as documentation on OS system calls.  Your
	MUDLib's auto object can override any, all or none of them.
      </li>
    </ul>

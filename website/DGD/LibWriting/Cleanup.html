  <h2> Cleaning Up Stray Objects </h2>

  <p>
    If you're running a persistent MUD, chances are good that you'll
    occasionally get a stray object sitting around, something that's
    no longer useful, and may never have been useful.  You'd like to
    get rid of objects like that because otherwise they can stick
    around for (quite literally) years.  How can you do it?
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library has some tools that you may want to use, or may
    just want to duplicate for your own MUD.  For instance, it has a
    daemon called ObjRegD, which keeps a list of every clone and who
    owns it.  That allows authorized users to look through the lists
    and get rid of old clones that are no longer in use, if they can
    figure out whether it's being used.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to the ObjRegD, it's possible in extreme or desperate
    cases to parse through a statedump.  You could also verify the
    contents of your object management code by reading the statedump,
    if necessary...  Any disagreement between them means a bug in your
    code.  The statedump has a fixed format, and the code that writes
    and parses it (the DGD server) is open to you, so you can verify
    that format easily enough.  Richard Braakman did this with the
    early DGD 1.1.X dumpfile format.
  </p>

  <h3> Garbage Collection </h3>

  <p>
    Your arrays, mappings and LWOs are all garbage-collected.  That
    means they'll go away, even circular structures of them,
    automatically.  Clones, however, are <i>not</i> garbage collected.
    In some sense it's impossible to lose the last reference to a
    clone because find_object() can always potentially return it.
  </p>

  <h3> Quotas </h3>

  <p>
    It's often a good idea to enforce quotas on how many LPC objects
    and how much memory a given administrator can use.  By doing that,
    and allowing the administrator to list what objects he is
    currently being 'billed' for (using the ObjRegD above,
    presumably), you can have administrators do much of your cleanup
    for you.  Periodic warnings for admins that are near their quota
    is a good way to make them clean up <i>before</i> they hit the
    actual limit and things start to go wrong.
  </p>

  <h3> Heuristics </h3>

  <p>
    What might you want to check for to determine if an object is
    unused?  Well, you can see who owns it &mdash; it's possible that
    you'll want to get rid of every object created by a now-inactive
    administrator when he leaves.  However, you might want to first
    check the objects and make sure they aren't in active zones.  That
    administrator might have done some building you weren't aware of.
    Those objects can first be transferred to the ownership of a
    different administrator, and then all the old admin's objects can
    be purged.
  </p>

  <p>
    You could keep track of how recently an object has been
    referenced.  If you update a time counter every time an object is
    picked up or used, you can determine what objects are more likely
    to be missed if they disappear.  Then you can look through the
    least-used objects by hand and eliminate any that seem
    superfluous.  However, this method has some pitfalls: make sure
    that objects like statues in highly-trafficked areas (which are
    seen often but almost never used) will not be marked as unused.
    If an object is seen often, you'll want to keep it.  Similarly, an
    active player may want to keep a 'buried treasure' somewhere out
    of the way where other players can't find it.  If you keep track
    of object owners, it may be easier to never get rid of an object
    owned by a currently-active player.
  </p>

  <p>
    To avoid problems like the above, you might simply never get rid
    of any 'physical' object in a player-accessible zone of the MUD.
    That will make it easier to track down only unused 'virtual'
    objects, or objects with no 'physical' location.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's also possible to have a 'testing' flag on objects in zones
    that haven't been opened yet.  That allows you to destruct them if
    they enter the game proper, but also allows you to destruct any
    'spare' clones of them that people are carrying (especially
    non-admin characters!) if you need the space.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's possible to use the status() kfun to get the most recent
    stored size of an object.  If you're trying to reduce the in-RAM
    footprint of your MUD rather than just getting rid of the largest
    number of (possibly small) objects, you might want to get a
    listing of objects ranked by size, which will let you optimize or
    remove the largest objects.  Note that this doesn't give the exact
    current size, it just gives the size the last time the object was
    swapped to disk.

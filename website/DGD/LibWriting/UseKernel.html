  <h2> Should You Use the Kernel Library for Your New MUD Library? </h2>

  <p>
    DGD comes with a little library called the Kernel Library.  It's
    not a game, or even a particularly good chat server.  Most of what
    it does is infrastructure, stuff that may not be obvious when you
    look at what it does.  So: what does it do for you?  Why would you
    use it?  Why wouldn't you use it?
  </p>

  <h3> What Does It Provide? </h3>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library builds on top of DGD.  And any game that can be
    built on top of DGD can be built on top of the Kernel Library,
    though it may require some funny contortions to make some of them
    work.  However, some kinds of <i>code</i> that would otherwise
    work in DGD won't work with the Kernel Library.  It's just that
    there's always a way to replace that code (in a game) with
    something else that works.  It's a little like saying that you can
    do anything in the C programming language without
    &quot;goto&quot;.  It may take some re-structuring, but you can do
    it.  And like &quot;goto&quot;, most of the things the Kernel
    Library restricts are things you probably shouldn't use.
  </p>

  <p>
    So other than being strict with you, what does the Kernel Library
    do for you?  Mainly, it provides upgradeability, security, and
    resource management.
  </p>

  <p>
    DGD is able to fully recompile all code in place, if you meet
    certain restrictions.  The Kernel Library, used properly, makes
    sure that you obey those restrictions.  There's no way to violate
    them, in fact, if you don't modify anything under &frasl;kernel,
    because the Kernel Library simply won't allow you to.  So the
    Kernel Library helps make sure that all your code can be upgraded
    instantly and in-place.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library also provides security.  If you've got code and
    data files in your directories, you'd like it if other
    administrators and builders can't change them, and for some of the
    files, you don't want other admins (or their objects and programs)
    to be able to read them.  The Kernel Library prevents that, not
    only for your files but also for your compiled programs running in
    memory.  That means you don't need to worry as much about trusting
    other administrators in the game, since they can't mess up your
    stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library also provides certain kinds of object
    management support and user management support.  You can register
    an object manager with the library, and the Kernel Library will
    call hook functions in your object manager whenever files are
    compiled, inherited or included so that you can do the rest of the
    work necessary to upgrade every object in place (you can also use
    somebody else's object manager, but it still needs the Kernel
    Library).  The Kernel Library will keep track of user connections
    and disconnections, and provide you with a nice interface to it.
    There are similar facilities to track errors, and cause all
    programs to implicitly inherit an AUTO-type object of your choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library will also keep track of resource usage for
    every administrator in the game.  The amount of memory space and
    processor time and the number of DGD objects are tracked
    automatically, as are several more obscure commodities.  It's easy
    to add more resource tracking for things like in-game money or
    power of monsters to keep your administrators and their areas from
    spawning too much of a good thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some additional functions defined by the Kernel Library
    for creating signals which an object can send and other objects
    can subscribe to.  That allows for various events occurring, and
    provides an infrastructure to make it happen in code.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information about building on top of the Kernel Library,
    see the <a href="../Kernel">Getting Started with the Kernel
    Library</a> section of this site.
  </p>

  <h3> Why Would You Use It? </h3>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library provides a standard base for building.  If DGD
    changes, the Kernel Library can help shield you.  For instance,
    when the behavior of send_message changed several years ago, the
    Kernel Library changed its behavior so that all Kernel-based MUD
    Libraries still worked on new versions.  The Kernel's abstraction
    layer can stay standard, even across different versions of DGD.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel provides some future-compatibility &mdash; it uses
    thread-local storage in several places that you might not know to,
    so every Kernel-based MUD Library is more likely to work well with
    the upcoming multiprocessor version of DGD.  You'll still need to
    fine-tune, but the Kernel gives the basics for free.
  </p>

  <p>
    By keeping your programming on the straight and narrow, the Kernel
    library is also handling needs you don't (yet) know you have.  For
    instance, you may not need to upgrade your objects initially, but
    if you use the Kernel then you can be certain that if that need
    comes up, you can meet it.  Similarly, you may initially have only
    a single administrator on your MUD.  If you then need to add a
    second or third administrator, the Kernel's built-in security
    makes it much easier to keep them from intentionally or
    negligently causing problems.  Since the Kernel Library was
    designed with very large projects in mind, and has been used in
    very complex projects, you can be sure that it's suitable for
    them.  Your own homebrew solution may require more work to fix the
    same problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel provides a base for various modules and upgrades.  If
    you start with it, you have several Object Daemons to choose from,
    and they should require little or no modification.  Phantasmal
    recently added an SSH daemon that had been written for the Kernel
    Library, and it required only about an hour of effort to get it
    working...  Phantasmal is Kernel-based, so the upgrade worked
    immediately and used Phantasmal's game code and user objects
    without a hitch.
  </p>

  <h3> Why Wouldn't You Use It </h3>

  <p>
    Some people prefer to write their own code, just in general.
    That's usually a very, very poor reason to avoid the Kernel
    Library &mdash; it solves many subtle problems, and you really
    need to understand them thoroughly if you don't use the Kernel.
    Thread-local storage, object upgrading, information being passed
    insecurely through the call-stack...  These are all topics that
    need to be addressed, but for which there is no good
    documentation.  The Kernel solves each of them, and many more.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more common reason to avoid it is that it seems too complex.
    The Kernel Library seems to give very little until you understand
    it well, and there's definitely a lot of code there.  However, as
    this page should demonstrate, the Kernel Library addresses a lot
    of different concerns, and it does so quite well.  It's
    complicated, but usually only because it has to be complicated.
    If there's something you're not concerned with that the Kernel
    Library does (like security, say), you're probably better off
    tearing the security-related code out of the Kernel Library and
    using the result than writing your own replacement...  The Kernel
    does a ridiculous variety of stuff, and it will be very hard for
    you to make sure you do all the same things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another common complaint is that the layout is unfamiliar.  The
    Kernel Library has an unusual security model based on objects
    checking what program is calling them.  It handles significant
    security and data integrity issues by checking the pathname of the
    program, so moving a piece of code from one directory to another
    (or calling it from a different function or object) can
    significantly change the behavior.  The security model can be both
    powerful and elegant once you understand it, but it requires
    significant effort to understand.  This is a significant issue
    &mdash; requiring MUD Library authors to understand unfamiliar
    code has held DGD back for years, and it's hard to find builders
    and coders who already know LPC, let alone DGD's Kernel Library.
    However, the only solution to the issue is to turn your MUD into
    yet another LPMUD clone.  If you're doing something new and
    innovative, you're going to have to work with some unfamiliar
    code, and so are your builders.  If you're <i>not</i> doing
    something new and innovative, why are you bothering to write your
    own MUD Library?

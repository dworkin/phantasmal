  <h2> Should You Use the Kernel Library for Your New MUD Library? </h2>

  <p>
    DGD comes with a little library called the Kernel Library.  It's
    not a game, or even a particularly good chat server.  Most of what
    it does is infrastructure, stuff that may not be obvious when you
    look at what it does.  So: what does it do for you?  Why would you
    use it?  Why wouldn't you use it?
  </p>

  <h3> What Does It Provide? </h3>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library builds on top of DGD.  And any game that can be
    built on top of DGD can be built on top of the Kernel Library,
    though it may require some funny contortions to make some of them
    work.  However, some kinds of <i>code</i> that would otherwise
    work in DGD won't work with the Kernel Library.  It's just that
    there's always a way to replace that code (in a game) with
    something else that works.  It's a little like saying that you can
    do anything in the C programming language without
    &quot;goto&quot;.  It may take some re-structuring, but you can do
    it.  And like &quot;goto&quot;, most of the things the Kernel
    Library restricts are things you probably shouldn't use.
  </p>

  <p>
    So other than being strict with you, what does the Kernel Library
    do for you?  Mainly, it provides upgradeability, security, and
    resource management.  For details, read about <a
    href="../Kernel/ScopeOfLib.html">the scope of the Kernel
    Library</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information about building on top of the Kernel Library,
    see the <a href="../Kernel">Getting Started with the Kernel
    Library</a> section of this site.
  </p>

  <h3> Why Would You Use It? </h3>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library provides a standard base for building.  If DGD
    changes, the Kernel Library can help shield you.  For instance,
    when the behavior of send_message changed several years ago, the
    Kernel Library changed its behavior so that all Kernel-based MUD
    Libraries still worked on new versions.  The Kernel's abstraction
    layer can stay standard, even across different versions of DGD.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel provides some future-compatibility &mdash; it uses
    thread-local storage in several places that you might not know to,
    so every Kernel-based MUD Library is more likely to work well with
    the upcoming multiprocessor version of DGD.  You'll still need to
    fine-tune, but the Kernel gives the basics for free.
  </p>

  <p>
    By keeping your programming on the straight and narrow, the Kernel
    library is also handling needs you don't (yet) know you have.  For
    instance, you may not need to upgrade your objects initially, but
    if you use the Kernel then you can be certain that if that need
    comes up, you can meet it.  Similarly, you may initially have only
    a single administrator on your MUD.  If you then need to add a
    second or third administrator, the Kernel's built-in security
    makes it much easier to keep them from intentionally or
    negligently causing problems.  Since the Kernel Library was
    designed with very large projects in mind, and has been used in
    very complex projects, you can be sure that it's suitable for
    them.  Your own homebrew solution may require more work to fix the
    same problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel provides a base for various modules and upgrades.  If
    you start with it, you have several Object Daemons to choose from,
    and they should require little or no modification.  Phantasmal
    recently added an SSH daemon that had been written for the Kernel
    Library, and it required only about an hour of effort to get it
    working...  Phantasmal is Kernel-based, so the upgrade worked
    immediately and used Phantasmal's game code and user objects
    without a hitch.
  </p>

  <h3> Why Wouldn't You Use It </h3>

  <p>
    Some people prefer to write their own code, just in general.
    That's usually a very, very poor reason to avoid the Kernel
    Library &mdash; it solves many subtle problems, and you really
    need to understand them thoroughly if you don't use the Kernel.
    Thread-local storage, object upgrading, information being passed
    insecurely through the call-stack...  These are all topics that
    need to be addressed, but for which there is no good
    documentation.  The Kernel solves each of them, and many more.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more common reason to avoid it is that it seems too complex.
    The Kernel Library seems to give very little until you understand
    it well, and there's definitely a lot of code there.  However, as
    this page should demonstrate, the Kernel Library addresses a lot
    of different concerns, and it does so quite well.  It's
    complicated, but usually only because it has to be complicated.
    If there's something you're not concerned with that the Kernel
    Library does (like security, say), you're probably better off
    tearing the security-related code out of the Kernel Library and
    using the result than writing your own replacement...  The Kernel
    does a ridiculous variety of stuff, and it will be very hard for
    you to make sure you do all the same things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another common complaint is that the layout is unfamiliar.  The
    Kernel Library has an unusual security model based on objects
    checking what program is calling them.  It handles significant
    security and data integrity issues by checking the pathname of the
    program, so moving a piece of code from one directory to another
    (or calling it from a different function or object) can
    significantly change the behavior.  The security model can be both
    powerful and elegant once you understand it, but it requires
    significant effort to understand.  This is a significant issue
    &mdash; requiring MUD Library authors to understand unfamiliar
    code has held DGD back for years, and it's hard to find builders
    and coders who already know LPC, let alone DGD's Kernel Library.
    However, the only solution to the issue is to turn your MUD into
    yet another LPMUD clone.  If you're doing something new and
    innovative, you're going to have to work with some unfamiliar
    code, and so are your builders.  If you're <i>not</i> doing
    something new and innovative, why are you bothering to write your
    own MUD Library?

  <h3> The Kernel Library and Persistence </h3>

  <p>
    There was an e-mail exchange between Frank Schmidt and Dworkin
    about the suitability of the Kernel Library as a general-use MUD
    Library.  Some of it is excerpted below.
  </p>

  <pre>

Your view of what a kernel library should be seems to agree perfectly
with the function of the objects in the /dgd directory tree in the
2.4.5 mudlib -- which is certainly not that of DGD's kernel library.
Beyond that, I think you also fail to understand what the kernel
library can do, as evinced by your earlier comment that it "occupies"
the auto object and driver object.  If there is one thing that the
kernel library is good at, it is modifying or completely overriding
the behaviour of those two objects.

I think that some of this blindness is caused by the extraordinary
success of LPmud 2.4.5.  To get beyond that, let's take a look at
a completely different mud, Ultima Online, comparing features with
those of traditional LPmuds:

 - UO is persistent.

   Persistence is DGD's most important single feature (I like the
   term "continuous mud" better, but "persistent mud" is the
   standard term these days).  A persistent mud needs a design
   radically different from that of a traditional LPmud:

    - There has to be a way to change the behaviour of existing
      objects.  The kernel library is designed in such a way that
      upgrading objects -- that is, recompiling them without first
      destructing them -- is possible for all objects, given the
      limitations imposed by LPC inheritance.
    - If you have guest-programmer wizards like traditional
      LPmuds, you need a way to limit the resources available to
      individual wizards, since rebooting the mud to get rid of
      undesirable objects is not an option.  The kernel library
      has a generic resource management system which manages
      such things as number of objects or number of callouts by
      default, and to which new mudlib-specific resources can be
      added at will.
    - Such functionality as string formatting should not be in the
      auto object.  Having to recompile the 3D space code because
      a change was made in string formatting is ridiculous.

 - UO has a custom client.

   The kernel library cannot make any assumptions about what sort
   of client is being used.  It cannot even assume that everyone
   uses the same client.  It merely attempts to be as little in
   the way as possible -- not only in the matter of communications.

 - UO has no traditional rooms, add_actions, etc.

   All such things have no place in the kernel library's auto object.
   Similarly, nothing that is not needed in <all> muds within its
   target range has a place in the kernel library.

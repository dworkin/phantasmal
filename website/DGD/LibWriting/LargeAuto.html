  <h2> Designing Your AUTO Object </h2>

  <p>
    There are a number of tradeoffs in designing your AUTO object.
    One of the simplest, and the most fundamental, is: how much
    functionality will it have?  Will you have a simple AUTO object
    with only the barest and most necessary functionality, rather like
    the Kernel Library?  Will you have an AUTO object containing a
    wide variety of standard library functions on strings and data
    structures?  Will you include functions on finding an object's
    physical (in the MUD) environment and inventory?
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that any data in your AUTO object is duplicated
    throughout every object in the MUD.  This includes LWOs and other
    objects that you may want to be fairly small &mdash; DGD has no
    structures, so if your single global AUTO object is huge, then
    there will be no such thing as a small object in your MUD unless
    you build it out of arrays and mappings.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, remember also that if you take all the data and
    functionality out of the AUTO object, you'll need to explicitly
    inherit other libraries and perhaps use (slow) call_other()
    statements to call your commonly-used functions.
  </p>

  <h3> Driver Issues, Size and Space </h3>

  <p>
    In DGD, there is an obscure cost associated with functions in the
    AUTO object that are neither static nor private: all such
    functions have a cost of two bytes a piece in <i>every</i>
    inheriting object's program.  This is also true for non-private
    functions in all other (i.e. non-auto) objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Normally, this is not much of a problem.  However, if you were to
    have 200 such functions in the auto object, every other program in
    the game but that of the driver object would become 400 bytes
    larger.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can solve this by either keeping such functions out of the
    AUTO object, or by making the functions static so that only
    subclasses can call them.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no speed issue with a large number of functions.  DGD
    does excellent caching, and on average the cost of a function call
    does not increase with the number of functions available.
    However, do remember that regardless of other factors, no amount
    of caching will make a call_other() as fast as a local function
    call.
  </p>

  <h3> Function Performance </h3>

  <p>
    There are several performance issues to consider when deciding
    whether to put a particular function into the AUTO object.
  </p>

  <p>
    A call to a function in the auto object uses the special
    CALL_AFUNC instruction, which is 3 bytes in size.  Exactly the
    same functionality would be available with the CALL_DFUNC
    instruction, which takes 4 bytes.  Thus, programs that call
    functions in the auto object will be slightly smaller.  In the
    most extreme case, a function that consists of nothing but
    function calls will be almost 25% smaller if CALL_AFUNC can be
    used for every call.  There will be a barely measurable
    performance difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that programs larger than 2K are compressed before being
    saved in the swap file, where the compression factor depends on
    the redundancy of the byte code, so the size advantage in the swap
    file would be much less than 25% if the function mentioned above
    is large enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inheriting a utility object, which itself does not inherit
    anything, increases the size of the inheriting program by about 16
    bytes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Putting everything into the auto object increases the size of the
    working set.  For a single object the difference won't amount to
    much, but a mudlib wholly designed with the idea of keeping the
    working set small will have a performance advantage.  For a
    different take on &quot;working set&quot;, consider processor
    cache vs. main memory, rather than main memory vs. disk storage.
    The Xeon processor has a 1 Mb cache.  Keeping the working set
    small enough to fit inside that cache will be an enormous speedup.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can move functions into a separate 'manager' object rather
    than the AUTO object.  You'll be replacing calls to an inherited
    function with call_other statements.  A call_other is slower than
    a local function call, especially if the first argument is a
    string (since an additional call_other to the driver object will
    be needed to resolve the object name).
  </p>

  <h3> Multiple Files and File Size </h3>

  <p>
    It's often convenient to break functionality up into separate
    files.  Normally in DGD that means parent objects.  The
    functionality and variable scope are kept separate, and
    cleanliness is maintained.  The AUTO object can't inherit from any
    libraries.  If it did, they would inherit it again (since every
    library does), which would make a circular dependency.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, if you're making a large AUTO object and want the
    convenience of multiple files, you <i>can</i> use #include to put
    them all in one place rather than using 'inherit'.  This is one of
    the few times that #include is a reasonable way to add functions
    to an object.

You don't _inherit_ things into the auto object, you'll have to
#include them into it.  But yes, if you do that, you will be able to
use it whenever.

Now, personally I'd consider that really bad form and would prefer to
have something like /lib/sprintf.c available for the objects that
actually _need_ it.  But maybe that's just me, I like to keep the
auto-object(s) lean and mean, makes it less likely that security or
consistency bugs creep in.

Oh, and your reminder of the day:

Thanks in advance,

Yes.  In your auto-object, you can do something like this:

    static object find_object(string path)
    {
        /* Do some of your own sanitizing of input, etc. */

        /* ... */
        
        return ::find_object(path);
    }

If you redefine the function in the auto-object, then only code in the
auto-object can use ::function() to access the original.  And of
course the driver-object can, assuming you don't do bizarre things
like inheriting the auto-object, there.

Cheers,

Erwin.

The idea is that DGD focuses on doing the driver part right, and the 
things you'd consider essential to writing a mudlib -- like a string 
search function -- belong in a middle layer. If you chose to reject the 
existing middle layers, as many do, you also forfeit the right to say 
that DGD is too minimalistic.

All three bears are examples of how a kernel (or System) level library 
could choose to implement a user-friendly function. A mudlib developer 
should not need to meet the bears in person.

Well, the term 'proprietary' is a little misleading, since by and large 
everybody who writes something for DGD publishes it to the world...

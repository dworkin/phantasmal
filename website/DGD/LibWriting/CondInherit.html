  <h2> How Can I Conditionally Inherit a File? </h2>

  <p>
    When a program includes a file, the path_include function is
    called in the driver object.  By returning a different file name,
    you can change what file is included.  You can then choose between
    including an empty file and one that inherits the program you'd
    like inherited.
  </p>

  <p>
    The file must be valid either way, which is why you can't just
    have path_include return (nil) and include nothing at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the standard include file (usually
    &frasl;include&frasl;std.h) does not have path_include() called
    for it, so you can't redirect that one.  However, you can #include
    a file <i>from</i> the standard include file, and redirect that
    one.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library does this in a <a
    href="../Kernel/SecondAuto.html">slightly different way</a>, but
    underneath it's doing the same thing.  It uses AUTO as the name of
    the file included by the standard include file, which is why you
    need an empty file called AUTO to use this method.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that Kernel Library or not, you can use this for conditional
    inclusion, not just inheritance.  So if you'd like to change what
    gets put into the standard header, just have it include another
    file (again, the Kernel uses AUTO as that name) and you can put
    different #includes and #defines in the different AUTO objects
    that you return under different circumstances.  This is a
    <i>great</i> way to do scripting, because you can change the
    script's parent objects, predefined constants and standard library
    and AUTO-object functions, all without making the script itself
    have to include or inherit anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal's test game is a good example of the scripting usage
    above.  Have a look at its custom rooms in version 0.003 or later.

@@TITLE Which License@@

<h2>What License Should I Use For My Library?</h2>

<p>There are a number of different licenses that can be used for a
MUD Library, or indeed for any other piece of software. It
<i>is</i> worth remembering that several standard licenses (GPL,
LGPL) simply don't work the same way for a MUD server that they do
for most applications. That's not an exclusion in the license, but
rather the fact that the license provides limits on binary
distribution. Programs that are rarely or never distributed as a
binary, such as MUD servers, get around a lot of the restrictions
in licenses like the GPL that specifically restrict binary
distribution.</p>

<p>You can find a somewhat impassioned description of licensing and
its effects to date on the MUD community <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo3.phtml">here</a>. Disclaimer: I
wrote that article. Obviously, I'm biased.</p>

<p>The Phantasmal MUD library would use the GPL if it accomplished
the same thing for MUD servers that it did elsewhere. Instead,
Phantasmal is simply public domain. Here's <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sf.net/License.html">the reason for
that</a>.</p>

<h3>Why Is Licensing Content Hard?</h3>

<p>MUDs aren't the only arena where there are some problems
separating content from code, and figuring out what license goes
where. For instance, a lot of games use art. A GPL'd game doesn't
use GPL'd art, because there's not really any such thing as GPL'd
art. Instead, the art is usually licensed in some other way, or is
treated as part of the source code. But most frequently these days,
the art is licensed separately if it's any good.</p>

<p>MUD descriptions, areas, mobiles and even builder scripts are
essentially in the same category. They are a work of art, produced
in the MUD medium. That means it's in your best interests to be
able to license them separately from your MUD. Your MUD's license
probably talks mainly about code and executables (binaries), and
that's only vaguely applicable to art. Maybe your object scripts
are covered, but your descriptions and things really aren't.</p>

<p>However, in some ways, this is all an open issue. It's hard to
tell exactly where the legal lines are drawn. Your best bet is to
separately license the artistic content and then not give it to
anybody without making that license very clear. Distributing it
separately from your MUD code is probably a really good idea if
they have different licenses.</p>

<h3>Derived Works</h3>

<p>Under copyright law, if you start from somebody else's work and
add your own to it, you've made a derivative work from theirs. That
means, essentially, that they have part ownership of what you just
made, because you made it from their work too. It's a little like
the fact that you can't go draw your own Mickey Mouse cartoon with
Pluto and Goofy and then expect Disney to just look the other way.
They (reasonably and correctly) believe that the law protects them
from you doing that. It means that even if you only put them into,
say, 30% of your cartoon, and they don't even take up the whole
picture in that 30%, you still can't sell the movie because "most
of it is mine, not theirs". Copyright law doesn't work that
way.</p>

<p>The thing is, if you were to remove that 30% from your movie,
it's still not entirely clear that you fully own it. Because what
you've done is to make another derivative work of that <i>first</i>
derivative work, the one that you and Disney owned jointly (not
that they'd ever let you release it).</p>

<p>Why am I bringing this up? Well, some of you may be familiar
with the den of thieves that is the current MUD development
community. It's extremely common to see people basically file the
serial numbers off somebody's codebase and claim it as their own.
The most famous example is <a href=
"http://www.medievia.com">Medievia</a>, which has added a
tremendous amount of code and functionality, but is still very
clearly built on a Diku (Merc) base. Builders like <a href=
"http://www.kavir.org">KaVir</a> who have worked on Medievia have
<a href=
"http://520006811875-0001.bei.t-online.de/med.html">confirmed that
fact</a>.</p>

<p>When and if you find somebody has stolen your code, please bring
up the above facts about derivative works. And if you're thinking
of taking "just a couple of functions" from another codebase and
you don't plan to obey their license, please remember that you will
be using that code <i>illegally</i>, and if you <i>ever</i> plan to
make money off it, or even run a public MUD based on it, you can
never safely do so. You'll always have to worry about whether, for
instance, a rogue builder with a conscience might discover your
illegal act and (as KaVir did with Vryce) turn you in and show the
community that you're a criminal. And, as in Vryce's case, you
<i>will</i> be a criminal, so your counter arguments will all sound
really, really stupid and lame.</p>

<p>This happens <i>all</i> the time. Can we please, <i>please</i>
stop stealing from each other now?</p>

<h3>License Incompatibility</h3>

<p>Some licenses don't work together. For instance, if you have
code under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software
Foundation's</a> GNU Public License, you can't link it into code
that uses the Diku license, nor the LPMUD license. Those licenses
are incompatible because there is no way to satisfy the legalese of
the GPL while simulataneously legally distributing under the Diku
or LPMUD license. This is another common MUD community fallacy.
Please don't distribute code illegally. <i>Please</i>?</p>

<p>The easiest way to avoid this trap is to sit down and fully read
the license for the code you're going to use. Make sure you've read
the license and you understand what it means. The Free Software
Foundation have several pages that carefully explain each of their
licenses, and what those licenses require of you. You should read
those if you're going to use an FSF license. Please don't
distribute code illegally. No, seriously, I mean <i>you</i>
shouldn't. No more distributing illegal code. Why would you do it?
You're breaking the law if you do, and anybody who bothers to check
can tell that you're doing it. That's just stupid.</p>

<h3>Commercial Use</h3>

<p>First, go back up and read the 'Derived Works' section again.
No, seriously, go <i>do</i> it. Okay, now that you're certain (you
<i>are</i> certain, aren't you?) that you have the legal right to
use all your code commercially, and you're sure that <i>nowhere</i>
in the development process did you use somebody else's code and
sweep that fact under the rug, you can begin.</p>

<p>First off, when thinking about whether you'll use your code
commercially, and whether you'll let somebody <i>else</i> use your
code commercially, make sure you understand the licenses involved.
Some licenses, like Diku and LPMUD, prevent it entirely. Please
don't use that code illegally.</p>

<p>But let's say you're using something like Phantasmal as your
MUDlib, something that doesn't impose any limits on you. Now make
sure your server can be used commercially. In Phantasmal's case,
that means <a href="../Skotos/CommercialUse.html">commercially
using DGD</a>, which can be tricky. If you're writing based on
Melville, you'll need to get a license through Steve Schmidt, aka
MobyDick, the author. Remember that 'Derived Works' thing? It
applies to Melville, too, and Steve requires you to get a license
to use his work commercially. If you originally started from
Melville, you can't legally run your MUD commercially without
paying him.</p>

<p>Be aware that if you're running a MUD commercially, you could be
liable for <i>much</i> larger legal penalties if you're caught
violating somebody's license. That's because at that point, it's
effectively considered theft. And they can even tell, with some
work, just how much money you stole from the author by not paying
him.</p>

<p>If you're releasing <i>your</i> code for possible commercial
use, though, have a look at the license for Melville. It's very
simple, and boils down to 'you have to get a license to use it.' Or
you could go the full-on Phantasmal route and just say 'use it and
don't worry about me.' I'm a big fan of that approach, but that's
partially because I <i>know</i> how many weenies will steal my code
if it's any good, and I never want to have to worry about suing
them.</p>

<h2>Managing and Upgrading DGD Objects</h2>

<p>DGD is impressive in the degree of upgradability and <a href=
"Persistence.html">persistence</a> that it offers. However, to take
full advantage of the upgradability, you'll need to observe some
ground rules.</p>

<p>DGD's <a href="../Kernel/Inheritance.html">inheritance</a>
features aren't quite the same as a regular LPMUD, though they're
far more powerful if used correctly.</p>

<p>You'd like to be able to upgrade all your code while leaving
your data in place. For instance, you'd like to be able to write a
new feature for your MUD, and enable it while players are logged
in. Before the recompile, the feature isn't there. After the
recompile, it is. Players don't see any difference until they try
the new command, which works after the recompile. This is less of a
pipe-dream than it sounds. <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sf.net">Phantasmal</a> already does it using the
%full_rebuild command, and the Kernel Library has a less automated,
more awkward way to do it, but it can work. Sadly, few other DGD
libraries (except the closed-source <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> servers) seem to do this.</p>

<p>One reason that few libraries bother to do this is that it
requires tracking all object compilation and inheritance. The
Kernel Library makes this slightly easier by encapsulating that
functionality into an Object Manager (see the LPC Examples section
for several Object Managers, or download Phantasmal and look at
that one).</p>

<p>There are some other related tricks you can do. It's usually
very convenient to call a function on objects that are recompiled
but also have data. The data may need to be updated after the
change in code. Phantasmal calls an "upgraded" function in any
recompiled master object, if it exists (if clones or LWOs need to
be updated, the master must keep a list of them or they must be
looked up using the Kernel Library tracking facilities). <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos'</a> libraries use a different
method based on the call_touch kfun to update objects as they are
used. This makes a great deal of sense, given the quantities of
objects that Skotos' libraries deal with.</p>

<p>As a random aside, remember that an object isn't compiled until
the end of the thread where compile_object() gets called. So there
are some subtle issues about what version of the "upgraded"
function gets called. The old one, already compiled into the
object? The new one, the one that isn't currently compiled? You may
need to call_out() to a function that will call upgraded()
<i>after</i> the end of the current thread so that the object will
be recompiled, and the <i>new</i> version of upgraded() will be
called.</p>

<p>John "West" McKenna's Inferno library has a significantly more
complex approach, which allows for more interesting upgrades in
some cases. Its upgrader builds a list of objects that need
recompiling. It calls uninit() on them, then upgrading(). Then it
recompiles, then calles upgraded() and finally init().</p>

<p>The uninit() and init() functions are expected to do everything
that's required when an object moves from one place to another
except the actual move. This includes removing&frasl;adding
commands defined by the object from&frasl;to the user's grammar
table.</p>

<p>upgrading() and upgraded() are very rarely used. They're there
in case the new version of the code needs extra initialising.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library uses what's called an <a href=
"../Kernel/ObjectManager.html">Object Manager</a>, or ObjectD, to
do all of this. That doesn't change what you can do, but it does
alter some of the code.</p>

<h3>Turning Stuff Off</h3>

<p>If you're upgrading more than one object, or you're upgrading an
object and its upgraded() function hasn't been called yet, you'll
need to be sure to suspend network connections and network input
while all that is going on. If you're halfway through an upgrade,
it's dangerous to allow commands to execute, whether from players
or NPCs, because objects may call other objects that aren't
recompiled or upgraded yet. If you turn off new network
connections, and turn off call_out() statements to every object
except the one doing the upgrading (the Kernel Library has good
ways to do this) then you can do a multi-object upgrade safely.</p>

<p>If you do this, be absolutely <i>certain</i> to have appropriate
catch() and rlimits() statements that will allow you to turn
call_out() statements and network input back on. Otherwise an error
in an upgraded() function can hang your MUD completely, with no way
to fix it, not even with the 'safety' binary port that the Kernel
Library supplies.</p>

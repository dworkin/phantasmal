  <h2> Should You Write Your New MUD Library From Scratch? </h2>

  <p>
    First off, you should probably be aware that starting from scratch
    has prevented MUDs from advancing significantly since the early
    1980's.  I've written a <a
    href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo3.phtml">previous rant</a>
    on the subject, which I continue to stand by.  Since MUD authors
    are unwilling to use the work of others, an author who can write
    good dynamic content will write a MUD with no interMUD support, a
    lousy help system, and essentially every other feature done
    poorly.  He will plan to release a version with &quot;all the
    trimmings&quot;, and it will never be released.  Future MUD
    authors will throw his work away because it isn't complete, and
    they'll start from scratch on their own, and have the same
    problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    And so MUD Libraries will remain awful because nobody is willing
    to put more than six months of hard effort into a five-to-ten-year
    job.  It could take less time than that, but only with a
    coordinated team of skilled programmers with a good understanding
    of previous work.  Occasionally a coordinated team of skilled
    programmers starts work on a MUD, but invariably not one of them
    has really read the source code of more than one or two previous
    MUDs.  As a result, the work of Diku authors, LPC authors, MUSH
    authors and MOO authors is never brought into a single codebase
    &mdash; no programmer is familiar with all of their work, and
    nobody bothers to become so, even though it's all available for
    free if you bother to look.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best codebases, like SMAUG, are produced by improving an
    existing codebase, cutting out its problems and adding good new
    features.  While it would be nice to produce a good new codebase
    on a completely new design, nobody has ever done so in the MUD
    community.  Raw, decent new codebases that will (eventually) be
    improved by other people to the point of being good seem to
    happen.  The DikuMUD codebase is a fine example.
  </p>

  <p>
    Occasionally, a MUD will put together a good game with a so-so
    codebase (Blood Dusk is the only example I can come up with
    offhand) and then never release their code.  Many groups start
    with a good concept and say they'll release their code &quot;as
    soon as it works&quot;.  At least 75% of these groups, and
    probably more than 90%, never release anything.  The MUD Library
    never works to their satisfaction, or the effort stalls, and they
    don't release their code after it fails to work, either.  So all
    their effort turned out to be for nothing.  They never got any use
    out of it, and they never released it, so it was all worthless to
    everybody, even the authors.
  </p>

  <p>
    But hey, maybe you're planning to never release your code, none of
    it, back into the public domain.  A few people manage to write
    MUDs that way and run a decent game.  Most of <i>them</i> fail,
    too, mainly because they start from scratch.  But your chances
    seem to be higher than zero if you do it that way, so if you're
    doing that you could start from scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Statistically speaking, you're much, <i>much</i> better off
    starting from somebody else's codebase.  Either way, if you want
    the MUD not to immediately go under, you should open it for
    testing and <i>keep it running</i> as early as possible.
    Otherwise you won't catch errors quickly, and the MUD won't just
    be not running...  It won't even be runnable, because your
    co-builders (or you) have broken things and can't run the MUD to
    test them.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to build a game, first and foremost, the best way is
    to start with somebody else's code.  If you want to build a good
    MUD Library for other people's games, first and foremost, the best
    way is still to start with somebody else's code.  But, if what you
    want is a rough library with a new concept, one that will
    eventually influence others, then you may want to start from
    scratch.

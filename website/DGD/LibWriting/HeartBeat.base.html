<h2>Heart-Beat and Resets in DGD</h2>

<p>Most LP-type MUDs have a function called something like reset(),
or heart_beat(), which is called periodically. It might be called
every few seconds, or every few minutes, or just when a player
enters a new room for the first time, or for the first time in a
long while. Since DGD has no reset or heartbeat functionality, how
would you implement the same functionality?</p>

<h3>Periodic Calls</h3>

<p>DGD doesn't have alarm() statements and you don't want to run a
single thread of execution for all that long. Remember that
swapping and recompiling happen between threads, and you can't
normally run a thread while another thread is executing. So you'll
need to repond periodically to a timer, and you'll have to use
DGD's call_out() kfun to do it. Have each call_out handler schedule
itself to be run after a given interval &mdash; a few seconds, a
few minutes, whatever. Then have it execute the statements you want
to happen every so many seconds. Remember to schedule the new
call_out() <i>first</i>, because if an error happens somewhere in
the call_out handler, you don't want it to permanently stop the
timer.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to use catch() and rlimits() statements
when calling periodic functions. That will avoid infinite loops and
make sure that if one object's function has an error, the next
object's function still gets called. The catch() and rlimits() are
useful no matter how you choose to handle timing.</p>

<h3>Resets</h3>

<p>In addition to periodic timing, you can call functions when idle
objects are used again, something like a reset(). When the object
is used (a room being visited, for instance), you can set a
variable to the current time, showing the the object to be in use.
Then when a player uses the object again (comes back into a room),
check the time variable. If it's been longer than the reset period,
call the reset() function to put the room back into a pristine
state. If it hasn't, don't do anything.</p>

<p>A variation on the idle timer above would be to use DGD's
call_touch() kfun on idle objects. The call_touch kfun specifies an
LPC function to call on the object when it is next accessed by LPC
code. If you rarely or never call functions on idle LPC objects,
this can replace your own timer. Specifically, you can set a
call_out with a given delay when the resettable object is used.
When the object is next used, cancel that call_out and set another
one with the same delay. If the object ever goes unused for long
enough, the call_out will trigger. The call_out can use the
call_touch kfun to schedule a reset for the next time the object is
accessed. The object, being idle for awhile, will be swapped to
disk. And then, when it finally gets used again, it will be reset
when retrieved.</p>

<p>You may find yourself unnecessarily calling the call_touch()-set
function when you do operations that touch every object in your
MUD. For instance, saving objects on shutdown may touch every
object, so you'll find that you reset all of them. However, if
you're careful (for instance, you can use statedumps instead of
datafiles, which won't trigger your call_touch functions), you can
avoid this problem.</p>

<h3>Finding All the Objects</h3>

<p>You can add objects to a registry when they're created, like the
Kernel Library does with its ObjRegD. If you do so, then you've got
a list of all the LPC objects in the MUD. By using those lists, it
would be straightforward (but somewhat slow) to call a function on
every LPC object, including clones, in the game. Your auto object
would build the lists &mdash; see the Kernel Library code for
details on how. If you use the Kernel Library, a HeartBeatD in the
System directory would run through the lists and call the heartbeat
function on each object every so often, in response to a call_out
timer. If you don't use the Kernel, then you'll need to track
objects within your AUTO object somehow, and have a HeartBeatD or
similar daemon call periodically in the same way.</p>

<h3>Swapping Behavior</h3>

<p>If you have a function that is called on every object in the
MUD, you'll find that you drag every object into memory every time
it gets called. Since DGD is designed to handle MUDs much larger
than available memory, you're potentially getting yourself into a
sticky situation.</p>

<p>The problem can be partially solved by making objects idle if no
players are near them. That means that rooms without players won't
be reset, which is good for saving swapping and CPU time, but means
a heartbeat function can't be used as a consistent counter &mdash;
it skips when the object is idle.</p>

<h3>Logging Out Idle Players</h3>

<p>Either of of the above can be used to log off idle players. It's
easy to measure a player's idle time &mdash; just reset it every
time you receive new network input to that player's user object.
Then either have a timer that checks periodically (say every one
minute) and logs out every player that has been idle too long, or
have a per-player call_out statement. When the player sends network
input, set a call_out() for three hours in the future to log him
out. When he sends input again, cancel the old call_out and set up
a new one for three hours from the <i>new</i> input time. Continue
until the player quits. Make sure to remove the last call_out if
you're not destructing the object it gets set on! Or continue until
the call_out() happens and the player is logged out for being
idle.</p>

<p>While you could do it on-demand by checking at every network
input, that's not actually useful. That would log the player out
for idleness only if they ever came back and typed something again,
which misses the point. You'd rather close their connection as soon
as possible after they're idle to free up resources for your MUD.
For this reason, the call_touch approach isn't useful.</p>

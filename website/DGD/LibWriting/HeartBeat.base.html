  <h2> Heart-Beat and Resets in DGD </h2>

  <p>
    Most LP-type MUDs have a function called something like reset(),
    or heart_beat(), which is called periodically.  It might be called
    every fifteen seconds, or every few minutes, or just when a player
    enters a new room for the first time, or for the first time in a
    long while.  Since DGD has no reset() or heartbeat()
    functionality, how would you implement the same functionality?
  </p>

  <h3> Timing </h3>

  <p>
    DGD doesn't have alarm() statements and you can't run a thread of
    execution too long.  Remember that swapping and recompiling happen
    between threads, and you can't normally run a thread while another
    thread is executing.  So you'll need to repond periodically to a
    timer, and you'll have to use DGD's call_out() kfun to do it.
    Have each call_out handler schedule itself to be run again in
    fifteen seconds (or whatever your interval between heartbeats is)
    and then execute the statements you want to happen every
    heartbeat.  Remember to schedule the new call_out() <i>first</i>,
    because if an error happens somewhere in the heartbeat, you don't
    want it to permanently stop the heartbeat timer.
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll probably want to use catch() and rlimits() statements when
    calling heartbeat functions, to avoid infinite loops and to make
    sure that if one object's heartbeat function has an error, other
    objects still get called.  This is true no matter how you choose
    to handle timing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to heartbeat-style timing, you can do on-demand object
    reset.  When the object is used (rooms visited, usually), you can
    set a timer showing them to be in use.  Then when a player comes
    back into a room, check the idle timer.  If it's been longer than
    the reset period, call the reset() function to put the room back
    into a pristine state.  If it hasn't, don't do anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    A variation on the idle timer above would be to use DGD's
    call_touch() kfun on idle objects.  The call_touch kfun specifies
    an LPC function to call on the object when it is next accessed by
    LPC code.  If you rarely or never call functions on idle LPC
    objects, this can replace your own homebrew LPC timer.  You may
    find yourself unnecessarily calling the call_touch()-set function
    when you do operations that touch every object in your MUD, like
    saving objects on shutdown.  However, if you're careful (or use
    statedumps instead of datafiles), you can avoid this problem.
  </p>

  <h3> Finding All the Objects </h3>

  <p>
    You can add objects to a registry when they're created, like the
    Kernel Library does with its ObjRegD.  If you do so, then you've
    got a list of all the LPC objects in the MUD.  By using those
    lists, it would be straightforward (but somewhat slow) to call a
    heart_beat() function on every LPC object, including clones, that
    defines one.  Your AUTO object would build the lists (see the
    Kernel Library code for details).  If you use the Kernel Library,
    a HeartBeatD in the System directory would run through the lists
    and call the heart_beat() function on each object every so often,
    in response to a call_out().  If you don't use the Kernel, then
    you'll need to track objects within your AUTO object somehow, and
    have a HeartBeatD or similar daemon call periodically in the same
    way.
  </p>

  <h3> Swapping Behavior </h3>

  <p>
    If you have a reset() or heart_beat() function that is called on
    every object in the MUD, you'll find that you drag every object
    into memory every time it gets called.  Since DGD is designed to
    handle MUDs much larger than available memory, you're potentially
    getting yourself into a sticky situation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem can be solved by making objects idle if no players are
    near them.  That means that rooms without players won't be reset,
    which is good for saving swapping and CPU time, but means the
    heart_beat() function can't be used as a consistent counter
    &mdash; sometimes it skips.  This can be the on-demand resetting
    described above, or stopping heartbeat in idle areas, or both.
  </p>

  <h3> Logging Out Idle Players </h3>

  <p>
    None of the above are the easiest way to log off idle players.
    It's easy to measure a player's idle time &mdash; just reset it
    every time you receive new network input to that player's user
    object.  Then either have a heartbeat-style timer that checks
    periodically (say every one minute) and logs out every player that
    has been idle too long, or have a per-player call_out statement.
    When the player sends network input, set a call_out() for three
    hours in the future to log him out.  When he sends input again,
    cancel the old call_out and set up a new one for three hours from
    the <i>new</i> input time.  Continue until the player quits (make
    sure to remove the last call_out!) or the call_out() happens and
    the player is logged out for being idle.
  </p>

  <p>
    While you could do it on-demand by checking at every network
    input, that's not actually useful.  That would log the player out
    for idleness only if they ever came back and typed something
    again, which misses the point.  You'd rather close their
    connection as soon as possible after they're idle to free up
    resources for your MUD.

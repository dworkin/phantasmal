<h2>Statements</h2>

<p>A statement is sort of a full sentence of instructions, made up
from one or more expressions. Statements usually cover no more than
a single line of code. Sometimes it's necessary to break it up
though if it becomes too long simply to improve on legibility -- a
little like avoiding long run-on sentences. For most statements you
simply break the line between two words, but if you are in the
middle of a string you need to add a backslash (<code>\</code>) at
the end of the line in order for the gamedriver to understand
what's going on.</p>
<pre>
DRIVER-&gt;message("This is an example of \
a broken string.\n");
    
</pre>

<p>However, breaking a statement with backslash is extremely ugly
and makes the code hard to read. It's usually possible to break the
line naturally at the end of a string, or between two operators of
some kind, or even just split the string in half and add the two
parts together with the <code>+</code> operator. The only time the
backslash really is necessary is in
<code>#define</code>-statements, which we'll mention later.</p>
<pre>
DRIVER-&gt;message("This is a better way of " +
                "breaking a string.\n");
</pre>

<p>Statements in LPC almost always end with <code>;</code>. It's
considered good practice to put a newline there as well. That is to
say, you shouldn't put multiple statements on the same line if you
can help it. Keeping them separate makes them easier to read.</p>

<h4>The block statement</h4>

<p>There are a lot of statements
such as conditional statements that in certain circumstances
execute only <i>one</i> specified statement and no more. Suppose
you want to have several statements executed and not just one?
Well, there's a special statement called <b>block</b> statement
that will allow you to do that. A block is defined as starting with
a <code>{</code> and ending with a <code>}</code>. Within that
block you may have as many statements of any kind (including
variable definitions) as you like. The block statement shouldn't
end with a <code>;</code>, though usually it doesn't matter if you
accidentally put one there. Example:</p>
<pre>
if(my_var &lt; 3)
{
  statement_one();
  statement_two();
  statement_three();
}
    
</pre>

<h4>The ';' statement</h4>

<p>As stated <code>;</code> is mostly used to terminate statements.
However it's also a statement in its own right.</p>

<p>The <code>;</code> on it's own will simply be a null statement
causing nothing to happen. This is useful when you have
test-clauses and loops (described later) that perform their
intended purpose within the test or loop clause and aren't actually
intended to do anything else. Just remember that anywhere you're
allowed to have a statement, you can just put a <code>;</code> as a
statement that does nothing.</p>

<h3>Conditionals</h3>

<p>Conditional statements are used a lot in LPC, and there are
several ways of writing them. A very important concept is that
<code>0</code> and <code>nil</code> are considered as <b>false</b>
and any other value as <b>true</b> in tests. This means that empty
listings <code>({})</code>, empty strings <code>""</code> and empty
mappings <code>([])</code> also are evaluated as <b>true</b> since
they aren't <code>0</code> or <code>nil</code>. You have to use
special functions to compute their size or determine content if you
want test them.</p>

<h4>The if and else statements</h4>

<p>The most common conditional
statement is the <code>if</code> statement. It's easy to use and
can be combined with an <code>else</code> clause to do two
different things based on a variable's value. It's written like
this:</p>
<pre>
if (expression) statement;
e.g.
    if (a == 5)
        a -= 4;
    
</pre>

<p>If you want to handle the false case, you can add an
<code>else</code> statement like this:</p>
<pre>
if (expression) true-statement else false-statement;
e.g.
    if (a == 5)
        a -= 4;
    else
        a += 18;

or

    if(a &gt; 10)
      a -= 10;
    else {
      a += 100;
      b--;
      a -= 10;
    }
    
</pre>

<h4>The switch statement</h4>

<p>If one variable has to be tested for a lot of different values, the
resulting list of <tt>`if-else-if-else'</tt> statements soon gets
very long and hard to read. However, if the type of the value you
are testing is an integer, a float or a string you can use a much
denser and neater way of coding. Assume you have the following code
you want to write:</p>
<pre>
if (name == "fatty")
{
    nat = "se";
    desc = "blimp";
}
else if (name == "plugh")
{
    nat = "no";
    desc = "warlock";
}
else if (name == "olorin")
{
    nat = "de";
    desc = "bloodshot";
}
else
{
    nat = "x";
    desc = "unknown";
}
    
</pre>

<p>A better way of writing this is:</p>
<pre>
switch (name)
{
case "fatty":
    nat = "se";
    desc = "blimp";
    break;

case "plugh":
    nat = "no";
    desc = "warlock";
    break;

case "olorin":
    nat = "de";
    desc = "bloodshot";
    break;

default:
    nat = "x";
    desc = "unknown";
}
    
</pre>

<p>The workings of this statement is simple: <code>switch</code>
sets up the expression value within the parenthesis for matching.
Then every expression following a <code>case</code> is compared to
find a match.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>case</code> expression <b>must</b> be a
constant value. It can't be a variable, function call or other
expression.</p>

<p>After a match has been found the following statements are
executed until a <code>break</code> statement is found. If no
matching value can be found, the <code>default</code> statements
are executed instead.</p>

<p>While it's not mandatory to have a <code>default</code> section,
it's highly recommended since that usually means that something has
happened that wasn't predicted when writing the program. It's
usually very good to have an error message to notify the user (or
you) that something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>If you forget to put in a 'break' statement the following 'case'
expression will be executed. This might sound like something you
don't want, but if in the example above the names <tt>`fatty'</tt>
and <tt>`plugh'</tt> both should generate the same result you could
write:</p>
<pre>
case "fatty":
    /* FALLTHROUGH */
case "plugh":
    &lt; code &gt;
    break;
</pre>

<p>... and save a bit of space. Writing code with switch doesn't
make it any quicker to execute. It <i>does</i> make it a lot easier
to read, which reduces the chance of making mistakes while coding.
Remember to put the <code>/* FALLTHROUGH */</code> comment there
though, or it might be hard to remember later if it was intentional
or an omission of a <code>break</code> statement. If you have code
that's executed before falling through to the next case, this is
especially important. A good idea is usually to add an extra
linefeed after a <code>break</code> statement just to give some
extra 'breathing space' to improve on legibility.</p>

<h4>The ? : expression</h4>

<p>This is a very condensed way of
writing an <code>if/else</code> statement and return a value
depending on how the test turned out. The <code>?:</code> operator
isn't a statement, it's an expression since it returns a value.
It's listed here instead of being listed among the expressions
because it's effectively a conditional, though.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to write the following:</p>
<pre>
if (test_expression)
    var = if_expression;
else
    var = else_expression;
    
</pre>

<p>You can write that in a much more condensed way:</p>
<pre>
var = test_expression ? if_expression : else_expression;
e.g.
    name = day == 2 ? "tuesday" : "another day";
    
</pre>

<p>Opinions vary as to whether writing the conditional with this
operator makes the code easier or harder to read. A common rule of
thumb is that one use of the <code>?:</code> operator makes code
clearer, but that several in a single statement only makes it
worse. Something like this <i>definitely</i> isn't an
improvement:</p>
<pre>
name = day == 2 ? time == 18 ? "miller time" : "tuesday" : "another day";
    
</pre>

<h3>Loop statements</h3>

<p>There are two loop statements in LPC which incorporate the use
of conditional statements within them. That means they can be
programmed to execute only until a certain condition is true.</p>

<h4>The for statement</h4>

<p>If you want a counter or an iterator, you should usually use the
<b>for</b> statement. The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre>
for (initalize_statement ; test_expression ; end_of_loop_statement)
    body_statement;
    
</pre>When first entered, the <code>for</code> statement executes
the <b>initialize_statement</b> part. This part usually is used to
initialize counters or values for the loop itself. Then the first
loop starts. Every loop starts by executing the
<b>test_expression</b> and examining the result. This is a truth
conditional, so any answer not equal to <code>0</code> or
<code>nil</code> will cause the loop to be run. If the test
expression is true then the <b>body_statement</b> is executed,
immediately followed by the <b>end_of_loop_statement</b>. In the
<b>body_statement</b> you usually do what you want to have done for
this iteration. In the <b>end_of_loop_statement</b> you usually
increment or decrement counters as needed to prepare them for the
<b>test_expression</b> in the next loop.

<p>Throughout the previous section I used the word <i>usually</i> a
lot. This is because you don't <i>have</i> to do it that way,
there's no rule forcing you to make use of the statements in the
way I said. For the moment let's stick to the regular way of using
the <b>for-statement</b>. Later on I'll describe more refined
techniques, and you can discover your own as well.</p>

<p>Assume you want to compute the sum of all integers from 7 to 123
and don't know the formula ((x2^2 + x1^2) / 2). The most
straightforward way of doing that is a loop.</p>
<pre>
result = 0;
for (count = 7 ; count &lt; 124 ; count++)
    result += count;
    
</pre>

<p>First of all, <code>result</code> is set to 0. Then the actual
<code>for</code> statement is entered. It begins by setting the
variable count to 7. Then the loop is entered, beginning by testing
if count (= 7) is less than 124. It is, so <code>result</code> has
count added to it. Then count is incremented and the loop is
entered again. This goes on until the count value reaches 124.
Since that isn't less than 124 the loop is ended.</p>

<p>The loop form above is pretty standard in C, but you may have
realized there's another way you can write the same thing:</p>
<pre>
result = 0;
for (count = 7 ; count &lt;= 123 ; count++)
    result += count;
    
</pre>This way works fine too, and you may find it more
understandable. Then again, you may not.

<p>Please note that the value of count after the <code>for</code>
statement will be 124 and <i>not</i> 123. The
<b>test_expression</b> must evaluate to <b>false</b> in order for
the loop to end, and in this case the value for count then must be
124. This is true for <i>both</i> ways of writing the loop
above!</p>

<h4>The while statement</h4>

<p>The <b>while</b> statement is
pretty straightforward. You can probably guess from its name what
it does. The statement will perform another statement over and over
until a given <code>while</code> expression returns false. The
syntax is:</p>
<pre>
while (&lt;test expression&gt;)
    
</pre>

<p>Note carefully that the test expression is checked first of all,
before running the statement the first time. If it evaluates as
false the first time, the body is never executed.</p>
<pre>
a = 0;
while (a != 4)
{
    a += 5;
    a /= 2;
}
    
</pre>

<h3>The break and continue statement</h3>

<p>Sometimes during the execution of <code>switch</code>,
<code>for</code> or <code>while</code> statements it becomes
necessary to abort execution of the block code, and continue
execution outside. To do that you use the <code>break</code>
statement. It stops the execution of that block and continues after
it.</p>
<pre>
while (end_condition &lt; 9999)
{
    /* If the time() function returns 29449494, abort execution */
    if (time() == 29449494)
        break;

    &lt; code &gt;
}

/* Continue here both after a break or when the full loop is done. */
&lt; code &gt;
    
</pre>

<p>Sometimes you merely want to start over from the top of the
<code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop you're running. To do
that, you use the <code>continue</code> statement.</p>
<pre>
/* Add all even numbers */
sum = 0;
for (i = 0 ; i &lt; 10000 ; i++)
{
    /* Start from the top of the loop if 'i' is an odd number */
    if (i % 2)
         continue;

    sum += i;
}
    
</pre>Notice that the <code>i++</code> is executed when the loop is
continued. Only the <code>sum += i;</code> is skipped.

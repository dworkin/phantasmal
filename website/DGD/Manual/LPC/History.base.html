<h2>History of LPC</h2>

<p>LPC is an interpreted language created by Lars Pensjoe for
LPMUD. LPMUD, also written by Lars Pensjoe, is an interactive
multiuser environment suited for many purposes, games not the least
among them. Since its first appearance in 1988 the language has
changed dramatically.</p>

<p>Development was taken over around 1990 by other people at
Chalmers Datorfoerening, especially Jakob Hallen, Lennart
Augustsson and Anders Chrigstroem. They extended and refined the
language extensively but LPC still strongly resembles its parent
language, 'C'. The main differences lie in the object structure
that LPC imposes and several new data types to faciliate fast
development. LPC isn't as free-form as 'C', but it's far more
suitable for its original purpose - programming in a game
environment.</p>

<p>Felix Croes wrote a driver called DGD which uses a variant of
the standard LPC language. DGD is far more advanced than most LPC
drivers in several ways, although it includes a far smaller
standard library of functions. DGD is also different in that it
allows commercial licensing for a fee, which other LPMUD drivers do
not.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<h3>Function declarations</h3>

<p>A function's declaration must state what kind of data type it
returns, if any. A function name is a label much like a variable
name, consisting of 32 characters or less and starting with a
letter. No special characters other than <code>_</code> should be
used to separate words. Use function names that clearly reflect on
what they do. A function declaration looks like this:</p>
<pre>
/*
 * Function name: &lt;Function name&gt;
 * Description:   &lt;What it does&gt;
 * Arguments:     &lt;a list of the arguments and what they contain&gt;
 * Returns:       &lt;What the function returns&gt;
 */
&lt;return type&gt;
&lt;function name&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;)
{
   &lt;code expressions&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>The beginning comment, while optional, is highly recommended. Even if
you don't use precisely this form of comment, you should state what the
function does and what it expects to be given as input. Here is an
example function:</p>

<pre>
/*
 * Function name: compute_diam
 * Description:   Compute the diameter of a circle given the 
 *                circumference.
 * Variables:     circumference - the circle's circumference
 *                pi - a famous irrational constant
 * Returns:       The circle's diameter
 */
float compute_diam(float circumference, float pi)
{
    float rval;

    /* Circumference = pi * diameter, so
       diameter = circumference / pi */

    rval = circumference / pi;

    return rval;
}
</pre>

<p>The argument list is a comma-separated list of data types. It
specifies what kinds of data will be sent to the function and
assigns names to this data for later use. The data recieved will
<i>only</i> be usable inside the function, unless you explicitly
send it elsewhere. The function's argument names are valid only
within that function itself.</p>

<p>(In order to save space and improve on legibility in the text, I
won't put a header on every example function).</p>

<p>A function that doesn't return anything should be declared as
<code>void</code>. For instance:</p>

<pre>
void write_stuff(string mess)
{
    write_file("/usr/Bob/myfile.txt", mess);
}
</pre>

<h3>Function calls</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of function calls, internal and external.
We've only discussed internal calls so far.</p>

<h4>Making object-internal function calls</h4>

<p>Making an internal function call is as simple as writing the function
name and putting any arguments within parentheses afterwards. The
argument list is simply a list of expressions, or nothing. A function
call is an expression if it returns a value. A function call followed by
a <code>;</code> is a statement.</p>

<pre>
&lt;function&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;);
e.g.
    pi = atan(1.0) * 4;
    
</pre>

<h4>Making single object-external function calls</h4>

<p>An external call is a call from one object into another. In order to
do that you need an object reference to the object you want to call. We
haven't discussed exactly how you acquire an object reference yet, but
assume for the moment that it already is done for you. Object references
(the same thing as object pointers) can be stored in variables of type
<code>object</code>.</p>

<pre>
mixed &lt;object reference/object path&gt;-&gt;&lt;function&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;);
mixed call_other(&lt;ob ref/ob path&gt;, "&lt;function&gt;", &lt;arg list&gt;);
e.g.
    /*
     * Assume that I want to call the function 'compute_pi' in the
     * object "/d/Mydom/thewiz/math_ob", and that I also have the
     * proper object pointer to it stored in the variable 'math_ob'
     */
    pi = math_ob-&gt;compute_pi(1.0);
    pi = "/d/Mydom/thewiz/math_ob"-&gt;compute_pi(1.0);
    pi = call_other(math_ob, "compute_pi", 1.0);
    pi = call_other("/d/Mydom/thewiz/math_ob", "compute_pi", 1.0);
    
</pre>

<p>Note that you can either use the <code>call_other</code>
function or just use the -&gt; notation. One is syntactic sugar for
the other. The behavior is identical either way. Note that if you
use the <code>call_other()</code> form, you need to put quotes
around the function name since you're actually supplying any string
-- which can be a variable, or the result of a computation:</p>
<pre>
pi = call_other(math_ob, "computer" + "_pi", 1.0);
    
</pre>

<p>If the object you call hasn't been loaded into memory yet, it
will be. If it has a <code>create()</code> function that hasn't
been called, that function will be called (note that the
<code>create()</code> function may have a different name if DGD is
configured differently). If an external call is made to a function
that doesn't exist in the object you call, nil will be silently
returned without any error messages.</p>

<p>If you use an object path (a string) instead of an object
reference, the <b>master object</b> will be called. The master
object can contain data just like any of the clones, and is often a
good place to store a central copy of information that all clones
want to use without each one needing its own copy.</p>

<h4>Call-by-value versus Call-by-reference</h4>

<p>In LPC, most values are passed by value. What that means is that
when you pass, say, an integer variable with a value of 3 into a
function and you change that variable in the function, the variable
doesn't change outside the function . So the following code doesn't
do what it looks like it's supposed to. In fact, it does
nothing:</p>
<pre>
/* Swap two integers */
void swap(int a, int b) {
  int tmp;
  tmp = b;
  b = a;
  a = b;
}
    
</pre>

<p>The reason it doesn't work is because LPC makes the function's
parameters new variables and copies the values in. You're swapping
the value of the parameters, but those variables are going to
disappear at the end of the function. This is called call-by-value
because only the value gets passed in -- the original variable is
copied so the function never sees it. In C, we could use pointers
to pass references. In other languages, we could do what's called
call-by-reference, and the swap routine above could actually swap
the values of the two variables once the function was finished. LPC
passes arrays by reference. That means that if you change an
element in the array, it's changed <i>everywhere</i>, not just in
that one function.</p>

<p>LPC passes several types by reference: arrays, mappings and
objects. A mixed type is passed either by value or reference
depending on what type it "really" is underneath.</p>

<p>This has security implications. For instance, let's say a
function on your MUD keeps an array of all users. When queried, it
passes the array of users to a calling function. But a wizard on
your MUD would be able call that function and remove other users
from the array. That's a <i>bad</i> thing. So instead, you just
copy the array before returning it. If you just pass the array back
as an array or mixed variable, it's call-by-reference and the
wizard can change your copy. If you copy it first, it doesn't
matter how it's passed because he's looking at a different
copy.</p>

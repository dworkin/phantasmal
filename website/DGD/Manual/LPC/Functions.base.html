<h3>Function declarations</h3>

<p>A function's declaration must state what kind of data type it
returns, if any. A function name is a label much like a variable
name, consisting of 32 characters or less and starting with a
letter. No special characters other than <code>_</code> should be
used to separate words. Use function names that clearly reflect on
what they do. A function declaration looks like this:</p>
<pre>
/*
 * Function name: &lt;Function name&gt;
 * Description:   &lt;What it does &gt;
 * Arguments:     <a list="" of="" the="" arguments="" and="" what=
"" they="" contain="">
 * Returns:       &lt;What the function returns&gt;
 */
&lt;return type&gt;
&lt;function name&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;)
{
   &lt;code expressions&gt;
}
    </a>
</pre><a list="" of="" the="" arguments="" and="" what="" they=""
contain="">The beginning comment, while optional, is highly
recommended. Even if you don't use precisely this form of comment,
you should state what the function does and what it expects to be
given as input. Here is an example function:</a>
<pre>
/*
 * Function name: compute_diam
 * Description:   Compute the diameter of a circle given the 
 *                circumference.
 * Variables:     circumference - the circle's circumference
 *                pi - a famous irrational constant
 * Returns:       The circle's diameter
 */
float compute_diam(float circumference, float pi)
{
    float rval;

    /* Circumference = pi * diameter, so
       diameter = circumference / pi */

    rval = circumference / pi;

    return rval;
}
</pre>

<p>The argument list is a comma-separated list of data types. It
specifies what kinds of data will be sent to the function and
assigns names to this data for later use. The data recieved will
<i>only</i> be usable inside the function, unless you explicitly
send it elsewhere. The function's argument names are valid only
within that function itself.</p>

<p>(In order to save space and improve on legibility in the text, I
won't put a header on every example function).</p>

<p>A function that doesn't return anything should be declared as
<code>void</code>. For instance:</p>
<pre>
void write_stuff(string mess)
{
    write_file("/usr/Bob/myfile.txt", mess);
}
    
</pre>

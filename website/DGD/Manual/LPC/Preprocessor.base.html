@@TITLE The Preprocessor@@

<h2>The Preprocessor</h2>

<p>The preprocessor isn't a part of the LPC language proper. It's a
special process that is run before the actual compilation of the
program occurs. It can be seen as a very smart string translator.
Specified strings in the code are replaced by other strings.</p>

<p>All preprocessor directives are given as strings starting with
the character <tt>#</tt> on the first non-whitespace column of the
line. It's considered good practice to put preprocessor directives
on the very far left of the code, with the <tt>#</tt> in the very
first column.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.3.1" href="index.html#SEC3.3.1" id="SEC3.3.1">The
#include statement</a></h3>

<p><a name="IDX49" id="IDX49"></a> This is by far the most common
preprocessor command. It simply tells the preprocessor to replace
that line with the contents of an entire other file before going
any further.</p>

<p>Data you put in included files is usually data that won't ever
change and that you'll be referencing in several files. Instead of
having to copy and paste the same lines into multiple places and
maintaining multiple copies, you simply collect that data in an
include file and include it in the program files as appropriate.
Included file names traditionally end in <tt>.h</tt>.</p>

<p>The syntax for inclusion is simple:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;standard_file&gt;
#include "special_file"
    
</pre>

<p>Note the absence of a <code>;</code> after the line.</p>

<p>There are two different ways to write this. Which you use
depends on where the file is that you want to include. There are a
usually standard include files which may be in any of several
different directories. Rather than having to remember exactly where
they are, you can just give the name of the file you want to
include if it's in a standard include directory.</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;
#include &lt;types.h&gt;
    
</pre>

<p>If you want to include files that aren't in the standard include
path, for example files of your own, you have to specify where they
are. You can do that either relative to the position of the file
that uses it or by an absolute path. (NOTE: does DGD allow
non-absolute include paths?)</p>
<pre>
#include "/d/Genesis/login/login.h"
#include "my_defs.h"
#include "/sys/adverbs.h"     /* Same as the shorter one above */
    
</pre>

<p>When you include standard files, <i>always</i> use the
&lt;&gt;-path notation. Not only is it shorter and easier to
distinguish, but also if the files move around then files included
with relative or absolute syntax won't be found. If you use the
special include syntax then they will be found in any standard
directory, even if they move between them.</p>

<p>It's possible to include LPC files -- entire files full of code.
Doing so is normally considered <i>very</i> bad form. Error
handling usually has a bad time tracing errors in included files --
there are frequently problems with line numbers. Since you include
the uncompiled code into several different objets, you will waste
memory and CPU for these identical functions and variables. It also
tends to be harder to figure out where functions are defined.</p>

<p>What does the extension of the file name really have to do with
the contents then? Technically, nothing at all. But the convention
is to keep functions in <tt>.cc</tt> files and definitions in
<tt>.h</tt> files. Many mudlibs enforce this, and accept only
certain file suffixes for compilation or other tasks.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.3.2" href="index.html#SEC3.3.2" id="SEC3.3.2">The
#define statement</a></h3>

<p><a name="IDX50" id="IDX50"></a> <a name="IDX51" id="IDX51"></a>
#define is a very powerful <b>macro</b> or preprocessor command
that can be abused endlessly. It's recommended that you use it with
caution and only for simple tasks. Using it for complex tasks tends
to make reading or debugging your code quite difficult.</p>

<p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre>
#define &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;substitute pattern&gt;
#undef &lt;pattern&gt;
    
</pre>

<p>Any text in the file that matches <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code>
will be replaced with <code>&lt;substitute pattern&gt;</code>
before compilation occurs. A <code>#define</code> is valid from the
line it is found on until the end of the file or an
<code>#undef</code> command that removes it.</p>

<p>Although the preprocessor allows #define labels to be any sort
of legal text, it is customary to use only capital letters. This is
so that they will be easily distinguishable as what they are.</p>

<p>Place all defines in the beginning of the file. Again, the
compiler doesn't enforce this but it's a very good idea. It
guarantees not only that they are easy to find, but also that
they're usable throughout the file.</p>

<p>Common defines include paths, names and above all constants of
any kind. By defining them, you avoid writing them over and
over.</p>
<pre>
#define MAX_LOGIN  100          /* Max logged on players */
#define MY_USER    "/usr/System/my_user" /* My user object */
#define GREET_TEXT "Welcome!"   /* The login message */
    
</pre>

<p>Anywhere the pattern strings above occur in the file where
they're defined (and any file that includes it), they will be
replaced by the defined value above. The substitution includes the
comments above, but they're ignored by the compiler.</p>
<pre>
DRIVER-&gt;message(GREET_TEXT + "\n");
    
</pre>

<p>If a macro extends beyond the end of the line you can terminate
the lines with a <code>\</code>. That continues the macro onto the
next line. However, you <i>must</i> put the newline immediately
after the <code>\</code>. There may not be spaces or other
characters between the backslash and the newline.</p>
<pre>
#define LONG_DEFINE  "beginning of string \
                      and end of the same" 
    
</pre>

<p>Function-like defines are fairly common and often abused. It's
important to write macros such that every argument to the macro is
enclosed in parenthesis where it's used. If you don't do that you
can end up with some very strange results.</p>
<pre>
1: #define MUL_IT(a, b) a * b        /* Wrong */
2: #define MUL_IT(a, b) (a * b)      /* Not enough */
3: #define MUL_IT(a, b) ((a) * (b))  /* Correct */
    
</pre>

<p>What's the big difference? Look at this example:</p>
<pre>
result = MUL_IT(2 + 3, 4 * 5) / 5;

   Expanded with the three different macros, this becomes:

1: result = 2 + 3 * 4 * 5 / 5;       /* = 14, Wrong */
2: result = (2 + 3 * 4 * 5) / 5      /* = 12, Still wrong */
3: result = ((2 + 3) * (4 * 5)) / 5  /* = 20, Correct! */
    
</pre>

<p>Common problems with defined constants and functions include
badly formulated macros, complicated macros used inside other
macros (making the code almost impossible to understand) or
humongous arrays or mappings in defines that are used often. The
basic rule is to keep macros short and fairly simple.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC3.3.3" href="index.html#SEC3.3.3" id="SEC3.3.3">The
#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else and #elseif statements</a></h3>

<p><a name="IDX52" id="IDX52"></a> <a name="IDX53" id="IDX53"></a>
<a name="IDX54" id="IDX54"></a> <a name="IDX55" id="IDX55"></a>
<a name="IDX56" id="IDX56"></a> The commands above are all
preprocessor directives aimed at selecting certain parts of code
and perhaps removing others depending on the state of a
preprocessor variable.</p>

<p>The <code>#if</code> statement looks very much like a normal if
statement, but is written a bit differently.</p>

<p>Assume you <i>may</i> have one of the following definitions
somewhere:</p>
<pre>
#define code_VAR  2

or
        
#define code_VAR  3
    
</pre>

<p>Then you can write</p>
<pre>
#if code_VAR == 2
    &lt;code that will be kept only if code_VAR == 2&gt;
#else
    &lt;code that will be kept only if code_VAR != 2&gt;
#endif
    
</pre>

<p>You don't have to have the <code>#else</code> statement there at
all if you don't want to. You can simply use <code>#if</code> and
<code>#endif</code>.</p>

<p>It's sufficient to have the following statement to 'define' a
preprocessor pattern as existing:</p>
<pre>
#define code_VAR    /* This defines the existance of code_VAR */
    
</pre>

<p>Then you can use <code>#ifdef</code> to check for its existence,
like this:</p>
<pre>
#ifdef code_VAR
    &lt;code that will be kept only if code_VAR is defined&gt;
#else
    &lt;code that will be kept only if code_VAR isn't defined&gt;
#endif
</pre>

<p>or you can use #ifndef, which is essentially an #ifdef with an
extra "not" implied.</p>
<pre>
#ifndef code_VAR
    &lt;code that will be kept only if code_VAR isn't defined&gt;
#else
    &lt;code that will be kept only if code_VAR is defined&gt;
#endif
    
</pre>

<p>Again, the <code>#else</code> is optional.</p>

<p>The <code>#if/#ifdef/#ifndef</code> preprocessor commands are
frequently used to add debug code that you don't want to have
activated all of the time, or code that will work differently
depending on other very rarely changing parameters. Since the
conditions have to be hard-coded in the file and can't change
easily at runtime, most features will use a regular <code>if</code>
instead of an <code>#if</code>.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>Comments may seem like an odd thing to start with, but they're
everywhere so you need to be able to recognize them from the very
start. They're also important, so you need to know how to write
them from the very start.</p>

<p>In some LPC dialects, there are two kinds of comments:</p>
<pre>
&lt;code&gt; // This is a comment stretching to the end of the line.
       // NOT SUPPORTED BY DGD!

&lt;code&gt; /* This is an enclosed comment */ &lt;more code&gt;
    
</pre>The first type of comment starts off with the <code>//</code>
characters and then stretches all the way to the end of the line.
If you want more lines of comments, you'll have to start off those
as well with new <code>//</code> characters. This is like C++
single-line comments, and DGD does <i>not</i> support them!

<p>The second type has a definite length. Those comments start with
<code>/*</code> and end with <code>*/</code>. They are useful when
you have to write something that will stretch over several lines.
You only have to write the comment symbol at then beginning and
end, and not for every line in between. These are just like
standard C comments.</p>

<p>Please note that the <code>/* */</code> comment can <i>not</i>
be nested. It is <i>not</i> correct to write something like
this:</p>
<pre>
/* A comment
   /* A nested comment */
   the first continues
 */
    
</pre>What will happen is that the comment will end with the first
<code>*/</code> found, leaving the text <code>the first continues
*/</code> to be interpreted as if it was LPC code. That's not valid
LPC code, so instead you'll get an error.

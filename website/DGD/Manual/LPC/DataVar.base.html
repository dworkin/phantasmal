<h2>Data Types and Variables</h2>

<p>An object holds information in <b>variables</b>. Variables are a
sort of virtual container that holds information. It's called a
variable because the information is allowed to change later. Most
objects process information with <b>functions</b>. Functions can
use and return data of various kinds.</p>

<p>In principle only one kind of data type is needed, a sort of
general container that would hold anything you wanted it to. LPC
calls this type 'mixed'. Usually, though, it's much more useful if
you can distinguish between different types of information. Knowing
what's in a variable can be a very good thing. It <i>greatly</i>
improves on the time it takes to write and debug an object.</p>

<p>In LPC it is possible to use only data of type 'mixed'. In the
first versions of the language, that was the only data type
available. With modern LPC, however, it's better to avoid mixed
variables when you can.</p>

<p>LPC lets you declare variables of these types:</p>

<dl compact>
  <dt><tt>void</tt></dt>

  <dd>Void is only used as the return type of functions that don't
  return any data at all. You'll never declare a variable of type
  void, though you'll use it like other types.</dd>

  <dt><tt>int</tt></dt>

  <dd>Integers (LPC calls them 'int' for short) are whole numbers,
  normally between -2147483648 and 2147483647. For instance 3, 17,
  -32, and 999 are all perfectly good integers. You can write
  integers in a couple of different ways, such as in hexadecimal
  (base 16), but they're still the same data type underneath,
  they're just written differently.</dd>

  <dt><tt>float</tt></dt>

  <dd>
    <p>Fractional numbers, usually approximately between
    1.17549435e-38 and 3.40282347e+38. For instance 1.3, -348.4,
    2.0 and 4.53e+4 are floating-point numbers (LPC calls them
    'float'). In case you're not familiar with Scientific Notation
    for numbers, 4.53e+4 is the same as 4.53 x 10^4, 4.53 * 10000,
    or 45300.</p>

    <p>LPC doesn't recognized numbers like <code>1.</code> or
    <code>.4711</code> as floats. You have to specify both an
    integer and a decimal part for every number, even if they're
    zero for the number you're typing. LPC's just funny that
    way.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><tt>string</tt></dt>

  <dd>Strings are simply a series of printable characters. They're
  written with the characters in double quotes. For instance "x",
  "the string", "Another long string with the number 5 in it".
  Strings can contain special characters like newline (written as
  "\n") to end a line. A lot of LPC operators can handle strings
  directly, unlike in C. For instance, you can put two of them
  together with <code>+</code>. This makes strings much easier to
  use.</dd>

  <dt><tt>mapping</tt></dt>

  <dd>Mappings are another handy LPC feature. A mapping is simply a
  list of associated values. Assume you want to remember the ages
  of people. Say that Olle is 23, Peter is 54 and Anna is 15. In
  LPC you can turn this into the mapping <code>([ "Olle":23,
  "Peter":54, "Anna":15 ])</code>. The value to the right has been
  associated to the key to the left. You can then find the value by
  looking for the key. DGD lets you do intersections and unions and
  other operations on mappings.</dd>

  <dt><tt>object</tt></dt>

  <dd>Object pointers are references to LPC programs that have been
  loaded into memory. The object pointer may point to an original
  object, or to a clone.</dd>

  <dt><tt>Array</tt></dt>

  <dd>All of the above can appear in arrays, indicated by a
  <code>*</code> in front of the variable name in the declaration.
  Arrays in LPC are more like lists than arrays in C. LPC and DGD
  let you do unions and intersections and other array operations
  that most languages don't.</dd>

  <dt><tt>mixed</tt></dt>

  <dd>Type mixed is a general descriptor covering all the others, a
  sort of jack-of-all-trades type. An object of any other type may
  be stored within a mixed type. But when a regular type can be
  used, it should. Don't use mixed just because you don't want to
  remember the type's name. The type system is there to catch
  errors for you. Let it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There's also a special value called <code>nil</code>, which is
not really any of the types above. A string, mapping, array or
mixed variable that isn't initialized has a value of nil. A
freshly-allocated array is often allocated to nil. You can do some
tricks like assigning nil to an entry in a mapping to remove it.
Nil is like an undefined value, or a zero for things that aren't
necessarily numbers. You'll see more of it in examples later
on.</p>

<p>If you need to know the limits of integers, characters or
floating-point numbers, you can check DGD's
<tt>include/limits.h</tt> and <tt>include/float.h</tt> files. They
list limits of the various data types. Bear in mind that DGD can
easily be compiled with different integer and floating point
limits, so it's good to make your code check the sizes. They may be
different next time your program runs!</p>

<h3>Variable declarations</h3>

<p>A variable is a string of letters identifying an information
container, a place to store data. The container is given a name
consisting of 32 characters or less, starting with a letter. No
special character other than the '_' used to separate words is ever
used. Variables should always be given names that reflect how they
are used. You declare variables like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;data type&gt; &lt;variable name&gt;, &lt;another variable&gt;, ..., &lt;last variable&gt;;
e.g.
    int        counter;
    float      height, weight;
    mapping    age_map;
    
</pre>

<p>Variables must be declared at the beginning of a block,
immediately after the first <code>{</code> and before any other
statements. Global variables, variables that are available in all
functions througout the program, should be declared at the top of
the file.</p>

<p>Variables are initially set to 0 or to nil, and not necessarily
to the obvious 'empty' values. Mappings, arrays and strings will
all be set to nil and not to <code>([])</code>, <code>({})</code>
or <code>""</code> as you might expect.</p>

<p>Arrays and mappings should be initalized to their empty values
(<code>({})</code> and <code>([])</code> respectively) before being
used. You can't add a value to a mapping that's set to nil, for
instance, and you'll get a runtime error if you try.</p>

<h3>Arrays and Mappings</h3>

<p>It's time to dig deeper into the special types <b>array</b> and
<b>mapping</b>. For each of these data types there exist a number
of useful functions and operators that manipulate them and extract
information from them. Some of those functions and operators won't
be described in more detail until later.</p>

<h4><a name="SEC3.2.13.1" href="index.html#SEC3.2.13.1" id=
"SEC3.2.13.1">How to declare and use arrays</a></h4>

<p><a name="IDX45" id="IDX45"></a> Arrays really aren't arrays in
the proper sense of the word. They can better be seen as lists with
fixed order. The difference is that arrays can't usually be
manipulated easily, while LPC arrays have a rich set of operations
to reorder them, insert into them and otherwise manipulate
them.</p>

<p>Arrays are type-specific. This means that an array of a certain
type only can contain variables of that single type. All arrays are
one-dimensional, which means you can't declare an array which is
like a 2- or 3-dimensional grid rather than a list. However, the
<code>mixed</code> type takes care of these limitations. You can
also declare an array of arrays, which also takes care of the
problem. A mixed variable can act as an array containing any data
type, even other arrays. As a rule you should try to use properly
typed arrays to minimize the probabilities of programming mistakes.
When that's not possible, though, you can use the mixed type.</p>

<p>You declare an array like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;type&gt; *&lt;array name&gt;;
e.g.
    int *my_arr, *your_arr;
    float *another_arr;
    object *ob_arr;
    
</pre>

<p>The initial values of these declared arrays is <code>nil</code>,
<i>not</i> an empty array. I repeat: they are initialized to nil
and <i>not</i> to an empty array. Keep this in mind!</p>

<p>You can allocate and initialize an array like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;array&gt; = ({ elem1, elem2, elem3, ..., elemN });
e.g.
    int *my_arr;

    my_arr = ({ 1, 383, 5, 391, -4, 6 });
    
</pre>

<p>You can allocate an array of type <code>mixed</code> with the
<code>allocate</code> function, like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;array&gt; = allocate(&lt;num of elements&gt;);
e.g.
    mixed *some_array;

    some_array = allocate(4);
    some_array[0] = "Upper Slavonia";
    some_array[1] = ({ 1, 2, 7, 9 });
    some_array[2] = ([ "bob" : 7 ]);
    some_array[3] = 7;
    
</pre>

<p>To access members of the array, use brackets after the variable
name:</p>
<pre>
&lt;data variable&gt; = &lt;array&gt;[&lt;index&gt;];
e.g.
    val = my_arr[3];

    val2 = some_array[1][3];
    
</pre>

<p>LPC, like C, starts counting from array index 0. That means the
index to the fourth value in an array is 3.</p>

<p>To set the value of an existing position to a new value, simply
set it using the <code>=</code> operator.</p>
<pre>
    my_arr[3] = 22;     /* =&gt; ({ 1, 383, 5, 22, -4, 6 }) */
    my_arr[3] = 391;    /* =&gt; ({ 1, 383, 5, 391, -4, 6 }) */
    
</pre>

<p>If you want to copy a subset of an array you can specify a range
of indices within the brackets. This is called an <b>array
slice</b>.</p>
<pre>
&lt;array variable&gt; = &lt;array&gt;[&lt;start_range&gt;..&lt;end_range&gt;];
e.g.
    your_arr = my_arr[1..3];
    
</pre>This will result in <code>your_arr</code> becoming the new
array <code>({ 383, 5, 391 });</code> If you give a new value to an
old array, the previous array is lost.
<pre>
e.g.
    my_arr = ({ });
    
</pre>

<p>This code will result in <code>my_arr</code> holding an empty
array. The old array is deallocated and the memory previously used
is reclaimed by the driver.</p>

<p>If you index outside an array, an error occurs and execution in
the object is aborted. However, range indexing outside the array
does not result in an error, the range is then only constrained to
fall within the array. So, for instance, if <code>my_arr</code> is
an empty array, the code <code>my_arr[3..7]</code> will return an
empty array.</p>

<p>Concatenating (adding) arrays to each other is most easily done
with the <code>+</code> operator. Simply add them as you would
numbers. The <code>+=</code> operator works fine as well.</p>
<pre>
my_arr = ({ 9, 3 }) + ({ 5, 10, 3 }); /* =&gt; ({ 9, 3, 5, 10, 3 }) */
    
</pre>

<p>Removing elements from an array is most easily done with the
<code>-</code> or <code>-=</code> operator. Be aware that the
operator that will remove <i>all</i> items found that match the
item you want to remove, not just one.</p>
<pre>
my_arr -= ({ 3, 10 }); /* =&gt; ({ 9, 5 }) */
    
</pre>

<p>If you want to remove a single item somewhere in the array that
might have been repeated, you should use the range operator.</p>
<pre>
my_arr = ({ 9, 3, 5, 10, 3 });
my_arr = my_arr[0..0] + my_arr[2..4]; /* =&gt; ({ 9, 5, 10, 3 }) */
    
</pre>

<p>Be careful of the following difference. One is a list, the other
an integer:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;array&gt; my_arr[0..0]   /* = ({ 9 }) */
    &lt;int&gt;   my_arr[0]      /* = 9 */
    
</pre>

<p>This means that if you wrote the above code as follows, it
wouldn't work:</p>
<pre>
my_arr = my_arr[0] + my_arr[2..4];
    
</pre>

<p>Instead, it would warn you that you can't add an integer to an
array.</p>

<p>You can leave one end of the array slice unspecified, which will
use the beginning or end of the array. For instance:</p>
<pre>
my_arr = my_arr[..2] + ({ 3, 7, 4 }) + some_array[3..];
    
</pre>

<p>The code above would use elements 0 through 2 of my_arr, add ({
3, 7, 4 }) to the end, and then add all elements of some_array,
starting at the fourth.</p>

<h4><a name="SEC3.2.13.2" href="index.html#SEC3.2.13.2" id=
"SEC3.2.13.2">How to declare and use Mappings</a></h4>

<p><a name="IDX47" id="IDX47"></a> Mappings are lists of associated
values. They are of <code>mixed</code> type, meaning that the
different indices and the different values can be of varying types
within the same mapping.</p>

<p>Mappings can use any kind of data type for either index or
value. The index part of the mapping in a single mapping must
consist of unique values. There cannot be two indices of the same
value as one would overwrite the other.</p>

<p>You can declare a mapping just like any other variable, so let's
start with a few declarations for later use:</p>
<pre>
mapping my_map;
int     value;
    
</pre>

<p>Allocating and initializing can be done in two different
ways:</p>
<pre>
1:  &lt;mapping_var&gt; = ([ &lt;index1&gt;:&lt;value1&gt;, &lt;index2&gt;:&lt;value2&gt;, ... ]);

2:  &lt;mapping_var&gt;[&lt;index&gt;] = value;
    
</pre>

<p>The first is straightforward and easy.</p>
<pre>
1: my_map = ([ "adam":5, "bertil":8, "cecar":-4 ]);
    
</pre>

<p>In the second case, if a given index doesn't exist in the
mapping then it is created when referenced. If it does exist then
the value for that index is replaced with the one being
assigned.</p>
<pre>
2: my_map["adam"] = 1;    /* Creates the pair "adam":1 */
   my_map["bertil"] = 8;  /* Creates the pair "bertil":8 */
   my_map["adam"] = 5;    /* Replaces the old value in "adam" with 5. */
        ...
    
</pre>

<p>Unlike arrays there's no order in a mapping. The values are
stored in a way that makes finding the values as quick as possible.
There are functions that will allow you to get the component lists
(the indices or values) from a mapping but keep in mind that they
can be in <i>any</i> order and are not guaranteed to remain the
same from call to call. In practice they only change order when you
add or remove an element, but it's best not to rely on that.</p>

<p>You can merge mappings with the <code>+</code> and
<code>+=</code> operators, just as with arrays.</p>
<pre>
my_map += ([ "david":5, "erik":33 ]);
    
</pre>

<p><a name="IDX48" id="IDX48"></a> Removing items in a mapping is
simple. You can assign <code>nil</code> to that index of the array.
Doing so will delete the index/value pair:</p>
<pre>
my_map["david"] = nil;
    
</pre>

<p>Individual values can be obtained through simple indexing:</p>
<pre>
value = my_map["cecar"]; /* =&gt; -4 */
    
</pre>

<p>Indexing a value that doesn't exist will <i>not</i> generate an
error, only the value <code>nil</code>. Be <i>very</i> careful of
this since you might indeed have legal values of nil in the mapping
as well -- for instance, a value of <code>nil</code> might mean
that the index has no value part, or instead that the value indeed
<i>is</i> <code>nil</code>:</p>
<pre>
value = my_map["urk"]; /* =&gt; nil */
    
</pre>If you need to be certain, there is a function called
<code>map_indices</code> which will return the list of indices. You
can check to see if the index exists that way:
<pre>
if(map_indices(my_map) &amp; ({ "urk" })) {
    DRIVER-&gt;message("Urk is a member of the array!\n");
}
    
</pre>
<hr size="2">

<h3>Scope and prototypes</h3>

<p><b>Scope</b> is a term defining where a function or variable
declaration is valid. Since programs are read top down (just like
you read this page), declarations of functions and variables are
available to the below the actual declaration. However, the scope
might be further limited.</p>

<p>A variable that is declared inside a function is only valid
until the end of that function (the terminating <code>}</code>) is
reached. If it's declared in a block inside that function, such as
inside a <code>for</code> loop, it's only valid until the end of
that block (the <code>}</code> matching the beginning
<code>{</code> of that block).</p>
<pre>
&lt;top of file&gt;
int GlobCount;

/* Only GlobCount is available here */

void
var_func(int arg)
{
    int var_1;

    /* GlobCount, arg and var_1 are available here */
    &lt; code &gt;

    {
        string var_2;

        /* GlobCount, arg, var_1 and var_2 are available in this block */
        &lt; code &gt;
    }

    /* GlobCount, arg and var_1 are available here */
    &lt; code &gt;

    {
        int var_2;
        mapping var_3;

        /* GlobCount, arg, var_1, var_2 and var_3 are available here
          Note that this var_2 is a NEW var_2, an int not a string */
        &lt; code &gt;
    }

    /* GlobCount, arg and var_1 are available here */
    &lt; code &gt;
}

/* Here only GlobCount and the function var_func are available */
    
</pre>

<p>Function declarations follow the same rule of scope, though you
can't declare a function inside another function. Suppose you have
these two functions where the first uses the second:</p>
<pre>
int
func_1()
{
    &lt; code &gt;
    func_2("test");
}

void
func_2(string data)
{
    &lt; code &gt;
}
    
</pre>

<p>Then you have a problem, because the first function tries to use
the second function before it is declared. This may result in an
error message, and it's bad practice in any case. To take care of
this you can rearrange the functions so that <code>func_2</code>
comes before <code>func_1</code> in the listing. This isn't always
the best layout, and it isn't always possible. It's usually better
to write a <b>function prototype</b>. The function prototype should
be placed at the top of the file after the <code>inherit</code> and
<code>#include</code> statements (described later) but
<i>before</i> any code. It should look very much like the function
declaration itself. In this case:</p>
<pre>
&lt; top of file, <code>inherit</code> and <code>#include</code> statements &gt;

void func_2(string data);

&lt; the actual code &gt;
    
</pre>

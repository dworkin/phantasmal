"SEC5.2.4">Object Creation and Initialization</a></h3>

<p>When an object is initialized, its create function is called.
The create function is called "create" by default. It takes no
arguments and returns none. The name of the function that gets
called can be changed by the DGD Configuration File (see section
5.1.4).</p>

<p>When an LPC object is cloned, it gets initialized. This means
its create function is called. Therefore, every cloned object is
initialized by the time it is first used.</p>

<p>An LPC master object isn't initialized when it is compiled.
Instead, it is initialized the first time one of its functions is
called. This means that, for instance, if you have a master object
that registers itself with another object in its create function,
you must call a function on the master object (whether or not the
function is defined by the object) to have DGD call its create
function. If you call a function that doesn't exist, it won't do
anything and nil will be returned, just as usual. However, the
create function will still be called if the object was not
previously initialized.</p>

<h2><a name="SEC5.3" href="index.html#SEC5.3" id="SEC5.3">5.3 DGD
Memory Management</a></h2>

<p>DGD is a disk-based driver. This means that by default, it
stores everything on the disk and keeps little or nothing in RAM
besides the base driver. That's a good thing, because it means that
even if your game takes many gigabytes of storage, you'll have only
the currently-used stuff taking up RAM space. When your game is
idle, your machine won't have to store all the extra stuff in
RAM.</p>

<p>However, DGD doesn't use a standard virtual memory system like
your machine's Operating System does. Instead, it uses a special,
customizable system that knows more about your LPC program and how
it operates. DGD's system can also be configured specifically for
your application. All of this means that a well-tuned DGD
application can manage its memory much, much better than an
application that lets the Operating System do all the work for
it.</p>

<h3><a name="SEC5.3.1" href="index.html#SEC5.3.1" id=
"SEC5.3.1">5.3.1 Threads of Execution</a></h3>

<p>DGD does a lot of things at the end of threads of execution.
Swapping objects out to disk, recompiling objects and destructing
objects all occur at the end of the thread of execution that
requests them rather than occurring immediately. Since so many
things happen at thread's end, it's important to know what a thread
is and when it ends. Note that DGD's threads of execution are
<i>not</i> similar to threads in most other languages.</p>

<p>DGD threads happen very quickly and end very quickly. Unlike
"normal" threads, they don't ever appear to happen in parallel.
While DGD may actually execute more than one on a multiprocessor
machine, you'll never see that happening. Instead, DGD uses its
powerful atomic function mechanisms to make sure you'll never see
any conflict, and if another thread would conflict with yours, it
gets killed and later restarted. So in essence, DGD will always act
as though the threads started and stopped one after the other,
never overlapping. You can simply write your code as though you
were on a regular single processor machine and it will execute
flawlessly on a multiprocessor machine. For maximum speed there are
some tweaks that need to occur, but that's a very advanced
discussion for a later book.</p>

<p>DGD threads start when DGD calls into the driver or user object.
That happens when a new connection occurs, when new network input
arrives, when a scheduled call_out occurs, when an object is
destructed or recompiled, and when the Operating System sends DGD a
signal telling it that it has been killed, among other times. A
thread can never spawn another thread and wait for the result --
remember that DGD always behaves as though only a single thread is
running. So if one of the driver functions is called while other
code is waiting, then that function call will not spawn a second
thread. It will occur within the first thread.</p>

<p>When the function that spawned the thread returns, the thread of
execution is over. When that happens, any objects scheduled to be
recompiled or destructed will be. DGD may swap out objects that
haven't been referenced in awhile. If any call_outs are due, DGD
will choose one and call it. If new network data has arrived or a
new connection was made, DGD will call the driver or User object to
notify it. And so on...</p>

<h3><a name="SEC5.3.2" href="index.html#SEC5.3.2" id=
"SEC5.3.2">5.3.2 Objects and Swapping</a></h3>

<p>DGD objects take up space. The sector_size in the Configuration
file is the unit DGD uses for swapping. Any DGD object will take up
a certain number of sectors (rounded up), and will be swapped in
and out as a unit. Note that this refers only to normal DGD
objects. It doesn't apply to Lightweight Objects, arrays or
mappings.</p>

<p>When DGD has more than cache_size sectors in memory at the end
of a thread of execution, it will begin swapping out objects.
Starting with the in-memory object that was used least recently,
DGD will remove objects from memory until it has cleared up
1/swap_fragment sectors. So if swap_fragment is 32, it will clear
at least one thirty-second of all the sectors in the cache. It will
do this by removing objects from memory, starting with the least
recently used.</p>

<p>When cache_size is large, DGD can have a lot of objects in
memory at once before it starts swapping them out. Since swap_size
is how large absolutely <i>everything</i> can be in total, if
cache_size is as large as swap_size then nothing will ever be
swapped out to disk. This means that DGD will stop acting like a
disk-based MUD and rely on your Operating System to handle
swapping, if any needs to happen. It'll try to just keep everything
in memory all the time, though your Operating System will probably
only allow that if you actually <i>use</i> everything in memory
constantly.</p>

<p>The sector_size can also be important to tune. If it's small
then DGD will waste very little space since objects won't carry
much overhead. But if it's small then an object will require a lot
of sectors -- if sector_size was half as large, each object would
require about twice as many sectors, for instance. When that
happens, DGD has to keep track of more sectors and has to swap more
often. In general, use trial-and-error to tune the sector_size, if
you need to at all. Or ask the DGD mailing list, which is a
wonderful source of information.</p>

<h4><a name="SEC5.3.2.1" href="index.html#SEC5.3.2.1" id=
"SEC5.3.2.1">5.3.2.1 Lightweight Objects</a></h4>

<p>DGD swaps regular objects in and out individually, and it swaps
them as a whole. That means that if any part of the object is in
memory, the whole object is in memory. It also means that the
object is swapped into memory by itself -- it doesn't carry other
DGD objects with it.</p>

<p>Lightweight Objects (LWOs), arrays and mappings are all
exceptions to this rule. They are not standard DGD objects, and
they aren't managed like regular DGD objects. Instead, each array,
mapping or LWO is inside a regular DGD object and it gets swapped
into and out of memory with its parent object. This is why
references to arrays, mappings and LWOs are all copied at the end
of thread execution -- that way they live inside the object that
has a reference to them, not another object elsewhere. Copying is
the simplest way to achieve that.</p>

<p>An LWO, like an array or mapping, lacks some of the normal
characteristics of normal DGD objects. Like arrays and mappings,
they are garbage-collected and can't be explictly destructed. When
you're done with them, remove the last reference to them and they
will go away automatically. Since DGD can detect circular links
among data structures, you don't need to worry about the usual
problems with reference counting. DGD will garbage collect fully,
correctly and quickly, unlike Perl or Java.</p>

<p>The DGD editor, the DGD parse_string function and the
telnet_connect and binary_connect functions all involve special
objects. An LWO, an array or a mapping cannot be used for these
special objects. Only a full, normal DGD object can. Similarly,
LWOs may not have call_outs. This means that a call_out cannot be
scheduled from a function defined by an LWO.</p>

<p>Be careful... Destructing the master object from which an LWO is
created will destroy all the LWOs made from it. In this respect, it
is like a cloned object. Since arrays and mappings have no master
object, this isn't true of them.</p>

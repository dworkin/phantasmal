<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This tutorial is intended for anyone with a basic knowledge of
programming and a will to learn. You don't have to know C very well
before you start, and I believe that even true programming
beginners might be able to learn how to code. They will, of course,
have far more to do. There is much more good material available on
the topic of learning C than learning LPC, so it's recommended that
novices attempt to learn at least the basics of C before attempting
this book.</p>

<p>Experienced coders, including MUD coders, will need to read the
tutorial since it explains concepts that are unique to DGD's LPC
and to this book. They will be able to skim most of the book and
then use it primarily as a reference. The selection of what is and
what is not important is left to the reader.</p>

<p>The LPC language in actual application is closely wed to the
driver and mudlib it uses. This edition of this textbook is meant
for use with the DGD driver. Since the DGD driver includes a
mudlib, the Kernel Library, in the standard distribution, and since
the Kernel Library is public domain, we choose to include basic
information on its use in this volume. The basic information all
refers to plain, bare DGD, used with no other mudlib.</p>

Acknowledgments</a></h2>

<h3>Ronnie:</h3>

<p>I'd like to start by thanking Thorsten Lockert and Christian
Markus, perhaps better known as Plugh and Olorin, for their help in
proofreading this text, suggesting improvements and in general
being supportive and providing constructive feedback.</p>

<p>Without them this rather lengthy project would have taken even
longer (mind-boggling, but true) to complete and ended up a
<em>lot</em> worse.</p>

<h3>Angelbob:</h3>

<p>I'd like to acknowledge Ronnie, of course, for writing the
first, non-DGD edition of this text. I'd like to thank Felix Croes
(Dworkin) for producing the excellent DGD driver that made all this
possible. And I'd like to thank all the people out there writing
MUDs and working on DGD. You've made the work that I do useful and
in some cases, possible.</p>

<h2><a name="SEC2.2" href="index.html#SEC2.2" id="SEC2.2">ii -
Tutorial Setup</a></h2>

<p>The manual is divided into three progressively more advanced
sections. The first part explains the basics of coding and LPC
without delving too deeply into specifics.</p>

<p>The second part is aimed at the intermediate audience,
explaining many aspects of functions and operators more fully.</p>

<p>The third part handles applications and advanced topics that
seemed inappropriate for the first two chapters. In addition to
more advanced topics, this includes miscellaneous topics that the
more casual programmer may not care about.</p>

<p>If you are a new MUD administrator you may be taken back at the
thickness of this tutorial. Nonetheless, it's highly recommended
that you read all of it eventually, and that you read at least an
intermediate level of proficiency with all functions you commonly
use. Bear in mind that in this era of internet security problems
and rampant hacking, your MUD may be vulnerable as well. The better
you understand your code, the harder it is for hackers and
malevolent players or administrators to take advantage.</p>

<p>This manual is fairly extensive, but it's primarily aimed at
builders and administrators rather than driver programmers or
implementors who write mudlibs from scratch. It's important for
those latter categories to know how their work is likely to be
used, but the sort of very specific details that their work
requires don't age well and require a massive amount of information
that simply isn't useful to the more casual MUD administrator or
builder. For such implementors working under DGD, I highly
recommend the DGD mailing list. This list can be located from a web
search engine. As of this writing, it is located at <a href=
"http://list.imaginary.com/mailman/listinfo/dgd">http://list.imaginary.com/mailman/listinfo/dgd</a>.
I recommend typing the words "DGD mailing list" into Google, just
in case.</p>

<p>A note about gender: throughout the text I've used male
pronouns. This is not meant as a statement on female coders, but
simply a shorthand to avoid using the phrase "he or she" at every
instance.</p>

<p>Chapters that describe functions and macros in detail have a
subcaption with the names of the discussed items within brackets.
This should make it easy to search for them, for later
reference.</p>

<h2><a name="SEC2.4" href="index.html#SEC2.4" id="SEC2.4">iv -
Driver vs Mudlib</a></h2>

<p>The distinction between driver (also called the "gamedriver")
and mudlib is very simple in concept. The driver is the program
that runs on the host computer. It is a language interpreter with
an object management kernel, almost a small operating system in its
own right. It defines the LPC language, interprets it and executes
the instructions given to it through the LPC objects in the
game.</p>

<p>Since the driver defines the LPC language, different LPC drivers
define subtly different dialects of LPC. That's the reason for the
specific DGD edition of this text. DGD's dialect includes some
language features found in almost no other languages, and exports a
very limited set of functions from the driver.</p>

<p>The mudlib is the collection of LPC objects that make up the
basic game environment. It defines the "laws of physics" of the
gameworld, or the program being used if it's not a game. For
instance, DGD is used for Yahoo Chat. Therefore, there is somewhere
a Yahoo Chat library for DGD. That's an example of a very unusual
mudlib. More-standard mudlibs include GurbaLib, Phantasmal,
Melville, and the LPMUD 2.4.5 library which has been adapted for
use with DGD. Each of those mudlibs independently decides how its
rooms, verbs, creatures and other defining characteristics
work.</p>

<p>While the mudlib defines the standard objects and the commands a
game uses, there is also code and data specific to an individual
game. For instance, if you run an Old West game where the players
can go into the Bar None Saloon, the code that makes the Saloon
special is the domain code -- how the bartender acts, the
mannerisms that the waitresses have, all of this is specific to an
individual game, and usually kept separate from the mudlib code.
This is called domain code and domain data.</p>
<hr size="2">

<h2><a name="SEC2.5" href="index.html#SEC2.5" id="SEC2.5">v -
Administrative Setup</a></h2>

<p>The domain code and data is produced by administrators or
builders of a game. A MUD also often calls these people wizards or
immortals. Different games refer to them differently. This book
will call all game staff "administrators". "Builder" denotes
someone that produces domain code or domain data for the game.</p>

<p>Sub-areas of a MUD are also often called domains. The other
common name for them is zones. This book will refer to them as
zones to avoid confusion with the terms "domain code" and "domain
data". Each zone will usually have a player in charge of it, one
who regulates building within that area. Some zones will have only
a single player in charge who will be the only builder of that
zone.</p>

<p>While zones will be interconnected to some extent, usually they
are kept as separate as the game allows. This prevents any conflict
between the builders of the different areas over code or in-game
objects.</p>

<p>If you're a new administrator or builder on an LPMUD, you'll
want to find a zone to become part of, or start your own zone. Talk
to the head administrator or builder of the MUD to find out how new
builders are usually integrated into their MUD. Some MUDs like to
start new builders on their own private area while others like to
have them help out for awhile on existing areas.</p>

<h2><a name="SEC2.6" href="index.html#SEC2.6" id="SEC2.6">vi -
Writing code</a></h2>

<p>Formatting code properly makes it easier to read, easier to use
and generally more pleasant for all involved. This section
describes some fairly standard code formatting conventions as well
as why they may be worth the trouble.</p>

<p>Here are some good arguments for making the effort:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It makes the code much more readable, not only for others,
  but also for yourself, particularly if you have to read or alter
  the code six months after you produced it.</li>

  <li>Since it is easier for others to read, it's also easier for
  them to understand what you have done. That means it'll be easier
  for them to help you debug your code if you have problems. It can
  be very difficult to find people to help you debug
  badly-formatted code.</li>

  <li>Writing code properly actually makes it <i>better</i>,
  believe it or not. The reason for this is simply that writing
  code badly makes it easy to miss simple errors that get hidden in
  the hard-to-read code.</li>
</ul>

<p>What follows here are some guidelines about how to format your
code. Read it even though you might not fully understand what is
being discussed, then go back and re-read it later after having
learned the skills necessary. That way you won't pick up any bad
habits and have to unlearn them.</p>

<p>Be aware also that the specifics of how a piece of code should
be formatted is a very individual topic among programmers. Where
and when whitespace should be added and the number of spaces in an
indent are frequently disagreed on. If you're joining an existing
MUD, find out if they have policies on code formatting. If you're
starting your own, make sure to spell out your own policies on the
topic.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A new indent level is started at the beginning of each
  block.</li>

  <li>The closing curly-brace is in the same column as the first
  letter of the opening statement. Many people like to put the
  opening curly-brace in this column as well.
    <pre>
if (this)
{
    statement;
}
else if (that)
{
    another_statement;
}
else
{
    default_statement;
}
        
</pre>The important thing is to make sure to indent new blocks, and
to make sure you do it by the same amount everywhere you do it. If
you're modifying an existing piece of code, use the same number of
spaces that they do for indentation.
  </li>

  <li>Several arguments on a line separated by a comma have a space
  following the comma. Operators that can take multiple arguments
  (like <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>) have a space both before
  and after the operator.
    <pre>
int a, b, c;

for (a = 0; a &lt; 10; a++)
{
    b = function_call(a, b * 2);
    c = b * 3 / 4;
}
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>If a loop statement has no body, put the ending
  <code>;</code> on a separate line.
    <pre>
while (!(var = func(var)))
    ;
        
</pre>If you put it on the same line then it's <i>very</i> easy for
a reader to miss actual mistakes like this one:
    <pre>
for (i = 0 ; i &lt; 100 ; i++);
{
    &lt;code that gets executed only once, but always&gt;
}
        
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>In general, all <code>#define</code> and
  <code>#include</code> statements should be placed at the top of
  the file, or in a header file. The compiler allows you to spread
  them through the file but that will often cause confusion.</li>

  <li>The same goes for prototypes and global/static variables used
  in the file. Put them all at the top of the file with a proper
  comment header. The compiler will also let you spread these
  throughout the file and it's a bad idea to do so for the same
  reason as above.</li>

  <li>Break long lines of code in proper places so that they don't
  use more than 80 columns. This helps people using an 80-column
  terminal window and anybody trying to print out the code.
  <i>Note: we'll be breaking this one in the HTML version of this
  textbook. Sorry!</i></li>

  <li>The file should begin with a proper header. For instance:
    <pre>
/*
 * &lt;filename&gt;
 *
 * &lt;Short description of what the file does, no more than 5-7 lines.
 * ...
 * ... &gt;
 * 
 * Copyright (C): &lt;your name and year&gt;
 *
 */
        
</pre>You should also include a brief note about the license on the
code you've written unless you have and retain all rights to all of
it. But if you're writing for a MUD, you need to grant them the
right to use the code. That's either done implicitly by the license
for the MUD or explicitly by getting you to sign over the rights
they need. Talk to your MUD administrators about this if you don't
understand. The MUD should have a license for any code and content
that you submit to them.
  </li>

  <li>It's good to start every function with a header documenting
  what it does, who wrote it, what inputs and outputs it takes and
  what its side effects are. For instance:
    <pre>
/* 
 * Author:        &lt;Your Name&lt;
 * Function name: &lt;Function name&gt;
 * Description:   &lt;Short description of what the function does,
 *                 usually no more than three lines.
 * Arguments:     &lt;A list of all arguments, one per line
 *                   arg1 - description no longer than the line.
 *                   arg2 - next argument, etc. &gt;
 * Returns:       &lt;What the function returns&gt;
 */
        
</pre>If the function doesn't take any arguments, or doesn't return
anything, simply remove those lines in the header.
  </li>

  <li>Put suitable comments in the code here and there when doing
  something that might look a bit obscure. Remember that while you
  and the MUD administrators might be pretty competent, you'd like
  your code to be debuggable by anybody. Some day you might be gone
  from the MUD or hit by a bus (or just too busy to help with the
  problem), and you'd like the next person who looks at the code to
  be able to handle it rather than replacing all your hard work
  with something easier to debug.</li>

  <li>There are two common ways to write function and variable
  names. One is to use all lowercase characters and separate as
  necessary with underscores. The other is to use mixed case
  characters and use a capital letter only at the beginning of a
  new word. If you wanted your variable to be named "the quick
  brown fox", you might write it as either the_quick_brown_fox or
  TheQuickBrownFox in those two styles. Determine which
  capitalization scheme the MUD you're writing for uses. Use
  it.</li>

  <li>Constants and functions using <code>#define</code>s should be
  written in capitals (e.g. <code>#define AMOEBA "one celled
  creature"</code>). Doing this makes it easy to see what kind of
  symbol is being handled at all times. Functions that use
  <code>#define</code> are also called macros, or macro
  functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the easiest ways of getting a good editor is to use the
emacs editor, set up to use a modified c++ mode. The c++ mode
understands most LPC operators but needs a few hints on
indentation. Some example lines of code for your .emacs file:</p>
<pre>
;; emacs lisp script start

(setq auto-mode-alist (append '(
  ("\\.l" . my-c++-mode)
  ("\\.y" . my-c++-mode)
  ("\\.c" . my-c++-mode)
  ("\\.h" . my-c++-mode))
    auto-mode-alist))

(defun my-c++-mode () (interactive)
  (c++-mode)
  (setq c-indent-level 4)
  (setq c-brace-offset 0)
  (setq c-label-offset -4)
  (setq c-continued-brace-offset -4)
  (setq c-continued-statement-offset 4))

  ;; emacs end
    
</pre>

<p>An added advantage of using emacs is that you can correct
another coder's indention by typing 'M-&lt;', 'M-&gt;', 'M-x
indent-region'.</p>

<p>If you have no clue what emacs is you can look it up on a web
search engine or simply continue to use your favorite text editor.
Some MUDs will require you to use a specific editor or submit code
in specific ways, which may also affect your choice of editor.</p>

<p>To present things on the screen for the player to read, the

ways.</p>

<p>There are two special characters that are often used to format
text, <tt>tab</tt> and <tt>newline</tt>. They are written as

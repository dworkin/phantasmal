<h2>Building DGD</h2>

<p>The first step in learning any new programming language is to
set up the tools. For most languages, that means the compiler or
interpreter and possibly a debugger. For DGD, that means setting up
the DGD driver, sometimes called the DGD server or DGD
interpreter.</p>

<p>You'll need to download the DGD driver from the internet unless
you have a copy on other media. Make sure to get a recent copy of
DGD, version 1.4 or later.</p>

<h3>Installing DGD</h3>

<p>The DGD driver changes a lot from year to year, so any
instructions on installation may be out of date. These instructions
are valid as of early 2005 (DGD version 1.2.101), but if you have
any problems with them you should try a <a href=
"http://www.google.com">Google</a> search on "DGD", "compiling DGD"
or "installing DGD" to find out more about the latest instructions.
First, and more importantly, you should read any documentation that
comes with the package you downloaded about how to install it.</p>

<p>It's possible that you'll be able to find DGD in an
easily-installable form like RPM files or FreeBSD's ports tree or a
self-extracting archive with an InstallShield installer. The usual
choice, though, is to download a simple archive file (.zip for
Windows, .sit.hqx for Macintosh and .tar.gz for Unix) and install
it for yourself.</p>

<p>To install DGD, you'll need to compile it. This means you'll
need a compiler, such as GCC on Unix, CodeWarrior on the Macintosh
or Visual C++ on Windows.</p>

<p>I'll refer to the directory you installed DGD into as
<tt>dgd</tt> in this section. So if you installed DGD into
<tt>C:\PROGS\DGD</tt> then the path <tt>dgd/src</tt> would be the
same as <tt>C:\PROGS\DGD\src</tt>.</p>

<p>First, look in <tt>dgd/doc/Platforms</tt>. You'll see a chart
like this:</p>
<pre>
DARWIN          Darwin/OS X.  Also works for NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux.
LINUX           Older versions of Linux.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to
                src/host/Makefile.
SUNOS4          SunOS 4.x.
SOLARIS         SunOS 5.x.  In src/Makefile set LIBS to -lsocket -lnsl.  Older
                versions also require src/host/Makefile.sysv to be copied to
                src/host/Makefile.
DECALPHA        DEC Alpha.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
BEOS            BeOS.  In src/Makefile set LIBS to -lbe -ltracker, and copy
                src/host/Makefile.beos to src/host/Makefile.
WIN32           Windows NT or Windows 95.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/pc/README.
MACOS           Mac System 6 to 9.  Follow the instructions in
                src/host/mac/README.
GENERIC_BSD     BSD Unix.
GENERIC_SYSV    SYSV Unix.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
</pre>

<p>You'll need to follow the instructions for your platform. For
instance, on Linux you'd want to copy
<tt>dgd/src/host/Makefile.sysv</tt> to
<tt>dgd/src/host/Makefile</tt>. For Macintosh or Windows you'd want
to read the appropriate README file and follow its instructions.
It'll tell you where to find a project file for DGD for your
compiler. Normally those files ship with DGD, so the README file
will just tell you the right subdirectory to look in.</p>

<p>If you have troubles compiling the server, you can ask the DGD
mailing list for help. Please try a few web searches first to see
if your problem is already known, and if it's in the DGD mailing
list archives. You'll always look better asking questions on the
list if you've obviously made an effort on your own behalf first.
It makes people more likely to help you. The DGD mailing list is a
very powerful tool, and has many of the most competent DGD users in
the world reading it regularly. Try to be respectful of it, so that
its readers will, in turn, respect <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>To find the DGD mailing list, try doing a Google search for "DGD
Mailing List". You should be able to find a page that will tell you
how to sign up for that list, and how to find the old archived
messages from the list.</p>

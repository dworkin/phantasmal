<h2>Configuring DGD</h2>

<p>Every time you run DGD, you need to tell it a configuration
file. You can also optionally give it a statedump, but that won't
be covered until later. If your DGD driver binary is called
"driver" and your configuration file was called "mud.dgd", you'd
type "./driver mud.dgd", at least under Unix. On a Windows system,
you'd just say "driver mud.dgd". More likely you'd need to give a
pathname, like "driver ..\mud.dgd", but we're assuming here that
you know the basics of command lines and pathnames. If you don't,
maybe you should find a hobby other than running a MUD -- or just
learn to use your OS's command line, it's not that difficult.</p>

<p>That configuration file is pretty complicated and arcane
looking. Let's examine one, shall we?</p>
<pre>
telnet_port     = 8888;                 /* telnet port number */
binary_port     = 8889;                 /* binary port number */
directory       = "/code/phantasmal/testgame";  /* Replace w/ your absolute
                                                 path! */
users           = 40;                   /* max # of users */
editors         = 40;                   /* max # of editor sessions */
ed_tmpfile      = "tmp/ed";             /* proto editor tmpfile */
swap_file       = "tmp/swap";           /* swap file */
swap_size       = 4096;                 /* # sectors in swap file */
cache_size      = 100;                  /* # sectors in swap cache */
sector_size     = 512;                  /* swap sector size */
swap_fragment   = 32;                   /* fragment to swap out */
static_chunk    = 64512;                /* static memory chunk */
dynamic_chunk   = 261120;               /* dynamic memory chunk */
dump_file       = "tmp/dump";           /* dump file */

typechecking    = 2;                    /* highest level of typechecking */
include_file    = "/include/std.h";     /* standard include file */
include_dirs    = ({ "/include", "~/include" }); /* directories to search */
auto_object     = "/kernel/lib/auto";   /* auto inherited object */
driver_object   = "/kernel/sys/driver"; /* driver object */
create          = "_F_create";          /* name of create function */
    
</pre>

<h3>Network and Directories</h3>

<p>Note that text surrounded by <b>/* */</b> are comments, just
like in LPC.</p>

<p>The first entries are the telnet_port and binary_port entries.
Either can be a single entry, like above, or an array like the
include_dirs entry is above. For instance, if you wanted three
binary ports, you could say something like:</p>
<pre>
binary_port = ({ 8889, 8890, 9725 })
    
</pre>Versions of DGD before the late 1.2 series would only allow a
single telnet port and a single binary port. No standard version of
DGD allows outgoing network connections, and none is ever expected
to, for security reasons. You can find a patch to make your
personal version allow outgoing connections if you look around on
the internet for a bit. You're taking your security in your own
hands if you do this, though.

<p>The directory entry is an absolute path to the place to find the
library's code. An absolute path means it starts with a slash or
backslash, not dots or a tilde. On Unix systems, use slashes. On
Windows systems, use backslashes.</p>

<p>Swap_file is the name of the swap file that DGD will use for
your objects when they're not in the active set in RAM (if you
don't know what this means, don't worry). The swap file of a
running game can get big. You can control just <i>how</i> big with
the swap_sectors and sector_size entries in this file. Usually it
stays pretty small for a test program.</p>

<p>The dump_file is where DGD will put your statedump when your
library requests one. Statedumps are a way of saving and restoring
an entire running MUD all at once.</p>

<h3>5.1.2 Resource Limits</h3>

<p>The users entry is how many simultaneous users your MUD
supports. The sky's the limit, but bear in mind that you can
increase this later if you need to. Also bear in mind that your
current hardware will only be powerful enough to support a certain
number of people well. Would you rather have fifty people gush
about how incredible your MUD is, or five hundred talk about how
slow and buggy it is?</p>

<p>"Editors" is how many people can be simultaneously editing
files. DGD has a built-in editor that few people would want to use.
This is how many instances can be running at once. The ed_tmpfile
entry is the filename that editor temp files will use when people
are mid-edit.</p>

<h3>Memory and Swapping</h3>

<p>Swap_size is the total number of sectors in the swap file, and
sector_size is how big one of those sectors is. Every object
(except Light-Weight Objects, LWOs, which we talk about later) in
LPC takes some number of sectors. If it takes less than some whole
number of sectors, the number gets rounded up. So if an LPC object
requires 2 sectors plus five bytes, it'll get rounded up to three
sectors. If your sector_size is very small, you won't waste much
memory but swapping will be slower. If the sector_size is large
then you'll find that DGD swaps things to and from the disk faster,
but you waste more memory. The usual default sector_size is 512
bytes, and it works pretty well for most simple applications.
Larger applications that swap massive volumes of data should
consider increasing the size, though that can actually worsen the
problem in some cases.</p>

<p>The swap_size is simpler to choose than sector_size. You'll find
yourself having to increase it periodically as your game gets
bigger and you start running out of memory or sectors. In some
cases, the MUD running very slowly can be a symptom of too small a
swap_size, so try increasing it every so often to see if it helps
performance.</p>

<p>The cache_size is how many of those sectors stay in RAM. The
bigger this is, the faster your library runs and the more of your
memory (as opposed to disk space) it takes up. You'll need to
decide how much memory you want to devote to your running game.
Making this bigger than swap_size is pretty pointless. Making them
equal just means that everything runs in memory instead of on disk,
so DGD effectively stops being disk-based. Since DGD understands
what it's doing better than your OS's virtual memory system, you
should only make DGD fully memory-based for libraries that can hold
everything in available RAM all at once. Do everybody a favor --
don't do this on the same machine you use for your desktop.</p>

<p>Several (or many) times a second, DGD will swap some objects
from memory to disk. That way, it uses less of your RAM on LPC
objects it isn't currently playing with. It dumps the stuff you
haven't been using recently first, and it chooses some fraction to
dump out to the disk. It will only do this if more than cache_size
entries are currently in memory. The swap_fragment is the
denominator of the fraction. That means that if swap_fragment is
50, DGD will dump 1/50th of your objects to the disk when it swaps.
So if you had 500 objects in memory and you didn't load any more
in, you might have 500, then 490, then 481, then 462, and so on, as
DGD dumps 1/50th of each new number of objects. DGD swaps objects
out at the end of each thread of execution. We'll cover what that
means in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The static_chunk and dynamic_chunk tell DGD how much memory to
use in a way that's pretty difficult to understand. Unless you
start running out of memory, I wouldn't recommend touching these.
Consulting with the author of DGD or the DGD mailing list would be
appropriate if you're doing a really large application and you need
the app to be very carefully memory tuned.</p>

<h3>LPC and Interface</h3>

<p>The typechecking determines how carefully DGD checks your LPC
code for correctness and questionable behavior. A typechecking
value of 2 is the strictest, and the default for most libraries.
It's highly recommended that your library leave it on that setting
so DGD can catch more of your bugs for you.</p>

<p>If you reduce it to 1, the values "nil" and "0" stop being
different from each other, just like in many other LPC dialects. If
you reduce typechecking to 0, function typechecking mostly goes
away and "nil" is still the same thing as "0".</p>

<p>The include_file is automatically included by every LPC program
as it's compiled. This is a way for you to add standard #defines
and things that every file will have automatically defined. Be
careful what you put in this file because there are some things you
can't put before an "inherit" statement, and you'd like to be able
to use inheritance in at least <i>some</i> LPC stuff.</p>

<p>The include_dirs are a list of directories that will be
automatically searched for LPC include files. If you use C or C++
for anything, this is like the include directories that you put in
the command line or the project settings. This tells DGD where
you're going to put all your header files. You can use a tilde in
these paths to mean the user's home directory. Note that this is
the user's home in the DGD directories, not the home directories of
the person installing DGD in the first place.</p>

<p>The auto_object is automatically inherited by every other object
in the game except the Driver. This is one of your big ways to
interface with DGD. The auto_object entry tells DGD where to find
this object. The path is relative to the base directory you gave in
the "directory" entry.</p>

<p>The driver_object gets called by DGD to notify your library of
external events. It's the only object that doesn't inherit from the
auto object (other than the auto object itself). Section 5.2 gives
the details of when and how the driver is called.</p>

<p>When an object is initialized, a create function is called. The
name of this function is given by the create entry in this file. If
the create function doesn't exist, it doesn't get called. You can
put a create function in the auto object, which guarantees it
exists, but make sure you understand about nomask functions and how
regular functions can be masked before you do this.</p>

<p>The array_size entry gives the maximum number of objects that
can be in an array or mapping. Since DGD will store the entire
array or mapping in a single in-memory object which will be swapped
all at once, it's in your best interests to keep this number
reasonable. There are <i>still</i> some ways you can make
unreasonably large objects that get swapped all at once, but this
helps keep simple bugs from destroying your library's
performance.</p>

<p>The objects entry tells DGD the maximum number of objects you
want to allow. If you want to make this much above 64,000 you'll
need to change some compile options within the DGD code, though
they're pretty easy to modify. This total only counts regular DGD
objects, not arrays, mappings or Light-Weight Objects, so this
really doesn't limit you very much. Again, this exists to keep
simple bugs from utterly destroying your performance in ways that
are very difficult to track down.</p>

<p>DGD allows you to make a function call with a built-in time
delay. After the delay is up, the call happens. This is called a
call_out. The number of these that can be stacked up and waiting to
happen is given by the call_outs entry. Multiprocessor and versions
of DGD after the late 1.2 series don't necessarily limit the number
of call_outs. This entry may not make any difference for those
versions of DGD.</p>

<h2>DGD Library API</h2>

<p>A library under DGD is basically a set of LPC programs that
respond to events of various kinds, especially network events. The
library needs to receive these events from DGD, and to request
services from DGD in response. For instance, DGD might tell the
library that a new incoming connection has been attempted, and the
library would need to tell DGD to accept the connection and send a
banner and login prompt.</p>

<p>The Driver object accepts notification of various internal and
external events. DGD calls different functions on the Driver to let
it know that specific things have occurred. The Auto object
modifies how the library can request services from DGD, and what is
or isn't allowed.</p>

<h3>The Auto Object</h3>

<p>Only the Auto object and the Driver object are guaranteed access
to DGD's standard functions in their original form. In most DGD
libraries, the Auto object will override some of these functions
and substitute new ones with the same names so that the underlying
version is masked. For instance, the Kernel Library uses this to
supply a new get_dir function, one that returns a list of compiled
objects in the directory along with the file names, sizes and
modification times.</p>

<p>Some libraries use this trick for security. For instance, the
Kernel Library carefully checks all calls to read and write files
so that only users with the correct permissions can perform those
operations. The Kernel Library also overrides the create() function
to do extra bookkeeping and keep track of owners and creators for
LPC objects.</p>

<p>The Auto object also allows the library to add convenience
functions. The Melville library supplies an input_to() function,
which allows an object to set what function will handle the next
network input to arrive. Melville also supplies simple string
handling functions and other basic standard library functions which
the DGD driver doesn't have by default.</p>

<h3>The Driver</h3>

<p>The Driver is notified by DGD when various events occur, and
it's also called by DGD to query certain information. It needs to
define a lot of functions, which do many and various things. Those
functions are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>void initialize(void)</dt>

  <dd>This function is called when the system starts up originally,
  or after a reboot, but not after restoring from a statedump.</dd>

  <dt>void restored(void)</dt>

  <dd>This function is called when the system is restored from a
  statedump.</dd>

  <dt>string path_read(string path)</dt>

  <dd>Used to translate a path for the built-in editor read
  command. If this function returns nil, the file can't be
  read.</dd>

  <dt>string path_write(string path)</dt>

  <dd>Used to translate a path for the built-in editor write
  command. If this function returns nil, the file can't be written
  to.</dd>

  <dt>object call_object(string objname)</dt>

  <dd>When a call_other(object,...) happens, including with the
  object.call() syntax, DGD calls this function in the Driver to
  find "object", the object whose function is being called. You can
  call compile_object() from call_object(). That may be a good idea
  if the object isn't already compiled.</dd>

  <dt>object inherit_program(string file, string program, int
  priv)</dt>

  <dd>When one program inherits another, DGD calls inherit_program
  in the Driver to find the LPC object for the program being
  inherited from. If priv is 1, it's private inheritance.
  Otherwise, it's normal inheritance. "File" is the one choosing to
  inherit, and "program" is the one being inherited. You can call
  compile_object() from inherit_program(). That's probably a good
  idea if "program" hasn't already been compiled.</dd>

  <dt>string path_include(string file, string path)</dt>

  <dd>An "include" statement in an LPC file will substitute the
  text of the included file directly, so nothing needs to be
  compiled (unlike call_object or inherit_program above). However,
  the Driver can still choose what file will be included. When the
  file is included, DGD will call the Driver's path_include
  function, and the returned string is the path of the file that
  will be included. If nil is returned, no file will be included
  and a compile error will occur. If a path to a file that doesn't
  exist is returned, pretty much the same thing will happen.</dd>

  <dt>void recompile(object obj)</dt>

  <dd>This function is called by DGD to indicate to the Driver that
  the parent class of an object is out of date. If the Driver
  responds by actually recompiling the object then it will use the
  new version of the parent class, and will again be up-to-date.
  See the section on inheritance for further details. This is a
  pretty complicated subject if you want to do it well.</dd>

  <dt>object telnet_connect(int port)</dt>

  <dd>Note: this didn't take a "port" parameter in older versions
  of DGD.<br>
  This function should create and return a User object for the new
  connection on the given telnet port. "Port" will be an offset
  into the array of telnet ports, so if there's only a single
  telnet port it will always have a value of zero. If nil is
  returned, the new connection will be rejected. See <a href=
  "#SEC5.2.3">section 5.2.3</a> for details on creating a User
  object.</dd>

  <dt>object binary_connect(int port)</dt>

  <dd>Note: this didn't take a "port" parameter in older versions
  of DGD.<br>
  This function should create and return a User object for the new
  connection on the given binary port. "Port" will be an offset
  into the array of binary ports, so if there's only a single
  binary port it will always have a value of zero. If nil is
  returned, the new connection will be rejected. See <a href=
  "#SEC5.2.3">section 5.2.3</a> for details on creating a User
  object.</dd>

  <dt>void interrupt(void)</dt>

  <dd>This function is called if DGD receives a kill signal, for
  instance if the computer's user shuts it down from the command
  line or the Windows Task Manager. Normally, it will shut down the
  system and perhaps dump state. Sometimes a forcible shutdown
  happens as a result of a bug, so it may be useful to save
  additional debugging information when this occurs.</dd>

  <dt>void compile_error(string file, int line, string err)</dt>

  <dd>DGD calls this function in the driver to let it know that a
  compile error has occurred. Usually this is a syntax error of
  some kind, or a type error. Several of these can happen in
  sequence for a single LPC file being compiled before a runtime
  error results from the failed compilation. "File" is the file
  being compiled, "line" is the line number in that file where the
  error occurred, and "err" is a human-readable description of what
  the error was.</dd>

  <dt>void runtime_error(string error, int caught, int ticks)</dt>

  <dd>The driver receives this function call when a runtime error
  of some kind occurs in normal, non-atomic code. This may be a
  failed function call, a lack of ticks or stack space, an explicit
  error signalled with the error() function, or many other possible
  problems. If the error is caught by a <b>catch</b> construct,
  "caught" will be equal to 1 plus an index into the return value
  of call_trace() indicating the frame in which the error was
  caught. "Error" is a human-readable description of the error that
  occurred. "Ticks" tells how many ticks of processor time were
  available when the error occurred. Note that runtime_error is
  called with unlimited processor time and stack space, so don't
  worry about it being called when a function runs out of ticks --
  that will work just fine.</dd>

  <dt>void atomic_error(string error, int atom, int ticks)</dt>

  <dd>This function is essentially the same as runtime_error, but
  is called when the error occurs in atomic code. "Atom" is an
  index into the return value of call_trace() indicating the frame
  in which the atomic code begins. Atomic_error, like
  runtime_error, is called with unlimited stack space and processor
  ticks.<br>
  Note that atomic_error, since it is called atomically, may not
  write to files or network connections.</dd>

  <dt>int compile_rlimits(string objname)</dt>

  <dd>If an LPC program uses the rlimits() construct, DGD will call
  this function on the Driver with that object's name. If the
  compile_rlimits function returns nonzero then that object is
  allowed to use rlimits() without restriction. If compile_rlimits
  returns 0 then every time the object tries to use rlimits(), DGD
  will query the Driver with runtime_rlimits to make sure it's
  okay.</dd>

  <dt>int runtime_rlimits(object obj, int stack, int ticks)</dt>

  <dd>DGD calls this function of the Driver to see if the supplied
  object is permitted to use rlimits() with the given arguments. A
  value less than zero for stack or ticks means unlimited, while a
  value of zero means no change. A positive value will set the
  limit to that value. If runtime_rlimits returns 0, the usage is
  illegal and will abort with an error. A nonzero return value
  means the rlimits call is legal.</dd>

  <dt>void remove_program(string objname, int timestamp, int
  index)</dt>

  <dd>Whenever a master object is removed, DGD calls this function
  on the Driver object. The object has already been destructed by
  the time this function is called, so find_object() on objname
  will fail or return a different issue. The index is a unique
  number for each issue of the object, so if multiple versions are
  compiled with the same name, each one will still have a different
  index for this call.<br>
  It's very important to track object removal because when a master
  object is destructed, all of its clones and child objects are
  destructed as well. Since this code should <i>really</i> never be
  allowed to fail, it's called with unlimited stack and processor
  time. It's also called from inside a catch{} statement.<br>
  It's important to track object inheritance, but doing so well can
  be very complex. Read about Object Inheritance for details.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="SEC5.2.3" href="index.html#SEC5.2.3" id="SEC5.2.3">The
User Object</a></h3>

<p>The User object is allocated by the Driver (or another LPC
program) and passed to DGD as the return value of telnet_connect()
or binary_connect().</p>

<p>The User object, like the Driver, defines specific functions.
DGD will call those functions to notify the user object that
certain things have happened. The User object must be a regular DGD
object, created with clone_object() or compile_object(). It may not
be a Light-Weight Object created with new_object().</p>

<p>DGD calls the following functions on a User object:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>int open(void)</dt>

  <dd>A connection has just been opened for this object. If the
  user object is for a telnet (not a binary) connection, the return
  value is ignored. For a binary connection, if the return value is
  zero, nothing further happens. If the return value is nonzero, a
  UDP connection will be opened, and UDP packets from the same host
  and port as the TCP connection may be received by this user
  object. After the first UDP packet is received, UDP packets may
  also be sent with the send_datagram() kfun.</dd>

  <dt>void close(int flag)</dt>

  <dd>The connection for this object has been closed. The function
  is called when the network connection goes linkdead (i.e. the
  connection is severed by the other end, or stops responding) or
  when the user object is destructed. If the user object was
  destructed, the flag parameter will have a value of 1. Otherwise
  it will have a value of 0.</dd>

  <dt>void receive_message(string message)</dt>

  <dd>This function is called with data received from the network.
  DGD's telnet connections are always line-mode rather than
  character-mode, and since the newline at the end is implied, they
  remove it before receive_message() returns the message that was
  received. Telnet connections also filter out any non-ASCII or
  high-ASCII characters such as international character sets,
  special terminal codes and ANSI color codes. Binary connections
  do no filtering, and simply return data as it was received.</dd>

  <dt>void message_done(void)</dt>

  <dd>This function is called when a buffered string that couldn't
  be sent immediately and entirely is fully transmitted. Sometimes
  when send_message is called, only some of the bytes can be
  immediately accepted. This function is called on the User object
  to indicate that more can now be accepted.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The latest updates on DGD configuration files and the interface
to the driver object can be found in DGD's "doc" directory, in a
file called "Introduction". If there is any conflict between what
you read here and that file in your copy of DGD, that file is
correct. Some details change from version to version of DGD, and
their Introduction file will give the details.</p>

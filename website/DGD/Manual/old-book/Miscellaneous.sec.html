Misc.DGDVersions DGD Version Numbers

<p>DGD changes almost constantly, but the changes are usually
small. The maintainer, Felix Croes (who uses the handle 'Dworkin'),
fixes small problems and puts in code for new features all the
time. However, it's important to know what versions of DGD are
good, usable and stable since all these constant fixes can make the
driver temporarily unstable.</p>

<p>Dworkin addresses these problems by having <em>major</em> DGD
versions, <em>stable</em> DGD versions, and <em>experimental</em>
DGD versions. Major versions are numbered 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, et cetera.
The major version after 1.2 will then be either 1.3 or 2.0. The
major version after 3.4, if there eventually is a 3.4, will be
either 3.5 or 4.0. Major versions indicate several years of effort
on Dworkin's part. Between 1996 and 2004, the major version went
from 1.0 to 1.2.</p>

<p>Stable versions come out much more frequently than major
versions. Usually stable versions will be numbered by patch. So,
for instance, major version 1.2 gave rise to stable versions 1.2p1,
1.2p2 and 1.2p3. These are called version 1.2 patchlevel 1, version
1.2 patchlevel 2, and version 1.2 patchlevel 3, respectively. If
you need to do ordinary DGD development, the most recent stable
version or major version (whichever came out more recently) should
be used.</p>

<p>When Dworkin puts out those little updates every week or two (or
occasionally more), he puts out experimental versions of DGD.
Experimental versions are numbered as the major version, but with
an extra number at the end. So the experimental versions of 1.2
would be 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, et cetera, up to 1.2.71 and beyond.
Dworkin released over a hundred experimental 1.1 versions before
version 1.2 came out!</p>

<p>Each stable version is usually the same as one specific
experimental version. So when a really stable, tested experimental
version comes out, Dworkin will release it, slightly modified, as a
stable version. So, for instance, if Dworkin were on experimental
version 2.0.53 and the last stable version had been 2.0p2, then he
might choose to rerelease 2.0.53 as 2.0p3 after light testing.
These are hypothetical examples, though those version numbers are
likely to occur eventually.</p>

<p>Experimental DGD versions will often have new features and
slightly different interfaces. For instance, DGD began allowing
more incoming network connections in version 1.2.45. This means
that code written for experimental versions from 1.2.45 onward
won't work on DGD 1.2.44 and before. So new code written for
experimental versions tends to be very tied to what DGD version you
have. Older code, though, tends to work just fine with newer DGD
versions, with a few exceptions. In general, it's easy to get them
to work if you're a decent programmer and willing to do a little
work. The old interfaces rarely change and never change very
dramatically.</p>@@SECTION Misc.LPCHistory A Brief History of LPC

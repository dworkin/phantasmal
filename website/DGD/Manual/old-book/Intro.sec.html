@@SECTION Introduction Introduction

<p>This is a book about a piece of software. It's an explanation of
how to use a powerful tool. The book assumes you have a certain
amount of experience and ability at computer programming. If you're
not already much of a programmer, it assumes that you're willing to
learn.</p>

<p>DGD is an interpreter and network server for a language called
LPC. LPC is based on C but it has object-oriented extensions. So in
concept the language is a bit like Java, Objective C or C++. Unlike
those languages, LPC was designed for a game environment and used
there for many years. Its history as a game scripting language
caused it to evolve in some very different directions than those
other C-based languages.</p>

<p>Since LPC is C-based, you'll do best if you already have a
certain amount of background in the C language. You'll also do just
fine if you know a bit of a C-like language such as C++ or Java. If
you need to learn C then "The C Programming Language" by Brian
Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie makes a fine companion volume to this
book. It's one of the first books on C and one of the best.</p>

<p>DGD has a strong background for code security. Specifically, DGD
and the LPC language are designed to allow people of questionable
skill and intent to run their own code on your server without
crashing it or disrupting what you're doing. DGD includes many
configurable limits on execution time, stack depth, object size and
operation privilege. Most of these limits are very carefully
designed and very well thought-out.</p>

<p>LPC comes from the LPMUD community originally. Even projects
like DGD and Pike that have begun to grow outside the MUD community
still reflect that origin in many ways. This book, like DGD itself,
attempts to be a hybrid. It is written to be maximally useful to
those who are building a MUD or similar game on top of DGD. But
everything written here should be useful in one way or another for
non-game applications. The topic is DGD and LPC, and there's also a
dose of MUDs and their implementation.</p>
<!-- @@SECTION Introduction.Conventions -->

<p>There are several forms of special text that you'll see in this
book. Anything that you type to DGD will be written like this:
<kbd>grant andy access</kbd>. Filenames, including Windows-style
and Unix-style, are written as <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt> or
<tt>C:\Programs\DGD\doc\kfun</tt>. Sample output from DGD to you is
written like this: <samp>DGD version 1.2p4</samp>. New terms in the
index will appear like <dfn>this</dfn>. If you don't see any
different formatting above then your edition of this book doesn't
mark them specially. Variables and keywords in DGD's dialect of LPC
will be written as <var>variable</var>. Generic code that doesn't
quite fit into any of the above categories will be written
<code>like this</code>.</p>

<p>This book will try to use phrases like "he or she" and
abbreviations like s/he where appropriate. However, they are
omitted in places for brevity or to improve the clarity and flow of
the text. In no case is any slight meant to any genders not
explicitly mentioned in a particular passage. Players of any race,
religion, creed, lifestyle, gender, color, accent, nationality,
education level, shoe size and condiment preference are heartily
welcomed.</p>

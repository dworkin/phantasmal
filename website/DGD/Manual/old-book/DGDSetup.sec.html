<h3>Running the Kernel Library</h3>

<p>You'll need to run the Kernel Library to do most of the
exercises in this book. A copy comes with every copy of DGD. So if
you've already installed DGD, you've already installed the
Kernel.</p>

<p>Your copy of DGD came with a file called <tt>mud.dgd</tt>. Look
in DGD's directory and you should find it pretty quickly. You'll
need to edit that file before you can use it.</p>

<p>In <tt>mud.dgd</tt>, you'll see various lines assigning values
to various names. One line will say something like <code>directory
= "/home/dworkin/dgd/mud"</code>. You'll need to change that path
to the absolute path for the directory where you installed the
Kernel Library. That's the <tt>mud</tt> subdirectory of DGD. For
instance, if you installed DGD into <tt>~alan/dgd</tt> on your Unix
system, you'd change the filename in quotes to
<tt>/home/alan/dgd/mud</tt>. If your DGD directory wound up in
<tt>C:\Programs</tt> on your Windows machine, you'd change the line
to <code>directory = "C:\Programs\DGD\mud"</code>. The end of the
line, the part surrounded by stars and slashes, is a comment. You
can ignore it or remove it entirely (including all the stars and
slashes).</p>

<p>Note that the path has to be an <em>absolute</em> path. That
means you have to start it with a slash on Unix. You'd use a
backslash or a drive letter on Windows. But you <em>can't</em> just
start it with the name of the directory where you installed DGD and
leave out where on the drive that directory is, that won't work. No
relative paths. So <tt>/home/bob/dgd/mud</tt> and
<tt>C:\Programs\DGD\MUD</tt> are fine, but <tt>DGD\MUD</tt>
isn't.</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you'll need to run the DGD program. If
you're running on Windows and you compiled with Visual C++, you can
run dgd by double-clicking it and then choose the mud.dgd program
from the menu. If you compiled on Unix or used the Cygnus tools on
Windows, you'll need to run the program from the command line, with
the .dgd file as an argument. For instance, from Unix, in the DGD
directory, you might type <kbd>./bin/driver mud.dgd</kbd>. Note
that while Win32 permits you to run DGD from the command line, you
won't get proper error output if you do. So it's recommended you
run DGD and then choose a configuration file from the menu
instead.</p>

<p>If you've done it correctly then DGD will print messages about
what version you're running and various other things. Then nothing
visible will happen. If you're not used to running your own MUD
server, this can be a bit disconcerting. Don't worry, it's normal.
In fact, if DGD stops and goes back to the command line (usually
with an error message), <em>that</em> would be abnormal. The
messages DGD prints will look something like this:</p>
<pre>
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** DGD 1.2.73
Jan 29 16:09:52 ** Initializing...
Jan 29 16:09:53 ** Initialization complete.
</pre>

<p>Once you're running the server, you'll need to telnet to your
MUD. That requires a telnet client or MUD client. On Unix, the
simplest method is to run telnet from the command line. The syntax
is simply <kbd>telnet &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</kbd>, where host
is the name or IP address of the host you're telnetting to, and
port is the port number. If you leave off the port number, telnet
will use port 23 by default, which is almost never what you want
for a MUD.</p>

<p>On Windows, you'll want to download a MUD client like zMUD or a
terminal program like TeraTerm or Putty. Do a web search on one of
those names, or just on 'Windows terminal program' or 'Win32 MUD
client' or similar.</p>

<p>Telnet back to your own machine, on the port where DGD is
running. Normally your machine's address will be 127.0.0.1 when you
telnet to it, which is called the <dfn>localhost</dfn> address. The
Kernel Library will usually start its telnet server on port 6047,
though you can check the file <tt>mud.dgd</tt> to be sure. You'll
want to telnet to the telnet port, not the binary port, from that
file. Your telnet program will attempt to connect to the wrong port
if you don't tell it the correct port number.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library will ask you for a login name. Tell it you
are <kbd>admin</kbd>. Then choose a password for this account. The
admin account is special, and gets a lot of privileges that other
accounts don't &mdash; you won't be able to do many of the
exercises in this book except with a privileged
account.</p>@@SECTION Setup.KernelOverview An Overview of the
Kernel Library

<p>To use the Kernel Library, you'll need a quick overview of what
you can do with it. This entire section applies only to the
unmodified Kernel Library -- any of this can be changed. But when
you start, this section describes how the interface works.</p>

<p>You can quit by typing <kbd>quit</kbd>, which is useful to know.
You can chat with others on the server by typing <kbd>say</kbd>, a
space, and what you want to say. This will send the message to
everyone else currently logged in. You can type <kbd>people</kbd>
to see who is currently logged in. All of these operations can be
performed by any user.</p>

<p>The admin user can also type <kbd>shutdown</kbd> to shut down
the server. He can also use the "code" command, which you'll learn
about in the next chapter.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library actually has a number of other commands, most
of them only for administrators, not players. Those will be covered
later as we need them.</p>

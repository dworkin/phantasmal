    <h2> What Does the Kernel Library Actually Do? </h2>

  <p>
    DGD is able to fully recompile all code in place, if you meet
    certain restrictions.  The Kernel Library, used properly, makes
    sure that you obey those restrictions.  There's no way to violate
    them, in fact, if you don't modify anything under &frasl;kernel,
    because the Kernel Library simply won't allow you to.  So the
    Kernel Library helps make sure that all your code can be upgraded
    instantly and in-place.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library also provides security.  If you've got code and
    data files in your directories, you'd like it if other
    administrators and builders can't change them, and for some of the
    files, you don't want other admins (or their objects and programs)
    to be able to read them.  The Kernel Library prevents that, not
    only for your files but also for your compiled programs running in
    memory.  That means you don't need to worry as much about trusting
    other administrators in the game, since they can't mess up your
    stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library also provides certain kinds of object
    management support and user management support.  You can register
    an object manager with the library, and the Kernel Library will
    call hook functions in your object manager whenever files are
    compiled, inherited or included so that you can do the rest of the
    work necessary to upgrade every object in place (you can also use
    somebody else's object manager, but it still needs the Kernel
    Library).  The Kernel Library will keep track of user connections
    and disconnections, and provide you with a nice interface to it.
    There are similar facilities to track errors, and cause all
    programs to implicitly inherit an AUTO-type object of your choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Kernel Library will also keep track of resource usage for
    every administrator in the game.  The amount of memory space and
    processor time and the number of DGD objects are tracked
    automatically, as are several more obscure commodities.  It's easy
    to add more resource tracking for things like in-game money or
    power of monsters to keep your administrators and their areas from
    spawning too much of a good thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some additional functions defined by the Kernel Library
    for creating signals which an object can send and other objects
    can subscribe to.  That allows for various events occurring, and
    provides an infrastructure to make it happen in code.

That's pretty much it. You have to ask yourself, how much of what the 
kernel library gives me do I need? And if that amount is large enough, 
then you need to question if it is realistic to believe you can -save- 
effort by -not- using it.

If you are going for a truly persistent Mud, i.e. you plan on rebooting 
only from state dumps once your Mud is up and running, then you -have- 
to either use the kernel library, or reimplement much of what it does. 
That is a non-trivial undertaking, to say the least.

Going persistent is a big deal. When you're persistent, you realize, you 
will never again cold-start your game. You never again get to feel like 
you're cleaning away all the old cobwebs. If you clone an object and you 
lose track of the clone, it's going to stay with you for eternity. If 
you compile a program and forget where it is, it'll stay compiled and 
forgotten forever. Crap builds up. If you make a terrible error a year 
into your Mud's uptime, an error that causes you not to be able to log 
in, you're screwed -- you have to go back to a saved statedump from a 
few days earlier, or if you didn't save any, lose all your state.

If Matt wants to avoid all this complexity, he should not try for the 
persistence right now. It cannot be overstated what a difference this 
makes. Save inventories and vital player data to file, perhaps using the 
trusy old save_object() and restore_object(). Worry about persistence in 
a few years. You really don't want to go for persistence as your first 
project.

The kernel library is not particularly friendly, true, and I completely 
agree that it is good to learn why you need something before you start 
using it. To limit the amount of "oops" that happens, seriously consider 
my suggestion not to start off with a persistent Mud. Then over time as 
you run the Mud, take note of how often you need to cold-start it and 
consider what would happen if you couldn't do that, ever. That'll give 
you a first appreciation of what need the kernel library attempts to fill.

Disclaimer: I doubt this list is complete.

The kernel-lib...

- provides the basic ability to add users, grant users access, grant
  users limited quota of objects, stack/ticks/callout-usage, to avoid
  someone going ahead and creating 60000 clones of some object and
  thereby taking the game down.

- provides the ability for external objects to 'hook' themselves into
  the /kernel/sys/driver.c object (and one or two other /kernel
  objects) so that you will be notified if an object is compiled,
  cloned, destructed, freed, inherited, a file #include'd, etc.

  This is where you would hook up an 'Object DB' that keeps track of
  the inheritance information so that you can write your own 'upgrade'
  command that recompiles whatever is necessary.  This is one of the
  things that is _not_ provided by the kernel-lib. :)

- provides a basic wiztool (with a very nice 'store results for reuse'
  approach).

- enforces that inheritables, clonables and 'other' code are in
  separate directories, 'lib/' subdirs for inherities, 'obj/' subdirs
  for clonables and, more recently, 'data/' subdirs for LWOs.

I'm sure there are other useful things but these are just some that
come to mind right now.

Hope this helps,

Erwin.

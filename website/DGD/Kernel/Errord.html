    <h1> Adding an Error Daemon </h1>

    <p> One of the things you'll want to do is have your MUD respond well
      to errors.  I know, I know, it's not as if
      <i>you</i> would ever make an error.  But you've got builders and
      co-coders who may not share your tremendous level of perfection.
      For their benefit you'll need to handle errors from time to time.
    </p>

    <p> So how do you do it?  Well, with the Kernel MUDLib there's a
      specific way to do it.  You just register an errord
      with the Kernel MUDLib to catch your errors for you.  Your errord
      can do whatever your little heart desires -- inform the current
      user, inform an administrator, log it to a file, analyze the error
      and provide blow-by-blow commentary, do a stack crawl...  Any or
      all of the above.  No sweat. </p>

    <p> Of course, <i>debugging</i> an errord is a mess, because by the
      time you do anything with it you're already handling an error.
      To make this easier, I like first adding a command called something
      like &quot;runtime_error&quot; for admins to use -- it'll do something
      obviously boneheaded, cause an error, and get your errord to kick
      in.  If you've got a
      command that's not especially well-debugged then that'll do just fine
      too as long as you know what the problem is and can cause it on
      demand. </p>

    <p> If you're going to register an errord, first you'll need to
      <i>have</i> an errord.  I put mine in /usr/System/sys/errord.c
      and this article assumes you do the same.  It doesn't much
      matter as long as it's a clonable.  That's kind of funny, because
      you'll never, ever
      clone it.  It may not make much sense at first blush, but remember that
      you never inherit from clonables
      and you never make lightweight objects from them.  If there was
      a kind of object that you couldn't do any of that with <i>and</i>
      you couldn't clone, then errord would be that. </p>

    <p> So what's in an errord?  The Kernel MUDLibs doc
      in &quot;.../mud/doc/hooks&quot; says: </p>

<pre>
void set_error_manager(object errord)   [System only]

    Install an error manager, in which the following functions can be called
    afterwards:

    * void runtime_error(string error, int caught, mixed **trace)

        A runtime error has occurred.

    * void atomic_error(string error, int atom, mixed **trace)

        A runtime error has occurred in atomic code.

    * void compile_error(string file, int line, string error)

        A compile-time error has occurred.
</pre>

    <p>
      So there are three functions (runtime_error, atomic_error and
      compile_error) that you'll need to worry about. </p>

    <p> We're not really going to worry about atomic_error in this
      document -- you only get those when you're in an atomic operation
      and something goes wrong.  Maybe later we'll have an &quot;Atomic
      Operations&quot; article in the Adding Stuff series, but until
      then the following stub will work well enough: </p>

<pre>
void atomic_error(string error, int atom, mixed** trace)
{
  send_message("Atomic error!\n");
}
</pre>

    <p>
      That's far from perfect.  It won't catch problems during startup
      or other times that there's no particular user doing anything
      such as login.  It also won't tell you any details, like the
      stack trace. </p>

    <p> If you have a system log I recommend logging any errors there,
      <i>not</i> just informing the user who caused the error.  I
      mention this because all the same things are going to apply to
      compile_error: </p>

<pre>
void compile_error(string file, int line, string error)
{
  send_message("Compile error in " + file + ", line " + line + ":\n"
               + error + "\n");
  write_file("/error.log", "Compile err " + file + " " + line + ":"
             + error + "\n");
}
</pre>

    <p>
      So if you were more sensible, you'd also want to log this to the
      system log -- much as the write_file at the end
      does.  Compile errors are less likely (though not impossible)
      on login, but they're also *more* likely on startup.  They
      tend to come accompanied by runtime errors, and runtime
      errors come with stack traces. </p>

    <p> If you're experienced at all in debugging, you're well aware of
      just how useful a stack trace can be.  Knowing not just where the
      error is, but who initiated the action that went wrong will let
      you know which recently-modified components are likely to be
      involved in the problem.  Runtime errors come with stack traces,
      so we should print one out.  Of course, that's a nontrivial bit
      of code, so if you're lazy like me, you'll prefer not to write it
      yourself. </p>

    <p> One place you can get it is from the Kernel MUDLib's
      runtime_error function in &quot;/kernel/sys/driver.c&quot;.
      If you were to shamelessly steal it and tack another write_file to
      &quot;/error.log&quot; on the end you might get a resulting
      function something like this: </p>

<pre>
void runtime_error(string error, int caught, mixed** trace)
{
  int size, i, len;
  string line, progname, function, str, objname;
  object obj;

  str = error;

  if(caught != 0) {
    str += " [caught]";
  }
  str += "\n";

  size = sizeof(trace) - 1;
  for(i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    progname = trace[i][TRACE_PROGNAME];
    len = trace[i][TRACE_LINE];
    if(len == 0) {
      line = "    ";
    } else {
      line = "    " + (string)len;
      line = line[strlen(line) - 4 ..];
    }

    function = trace[i][TRACE_FUNCTION];
    len = strlen(function);
    if(progname == AUTO && i != size - 1 && len > 3) {
      switch(function[..2]) {
      case "bad":
      case "_F_":
      case "_Q_":
        continue;
      }
    }
    if(len < 17) {
      function += "                 "[len..];
    }

    objname = trace[i][TRACE_OBJNAME];
    if(progname != objname) {
      len = strlen(progname);
      if(len < strlen(objname) && progname == objname[.. len - 1]
         && objname[len] == '#') {
        objname = objname[len..];
      }
      str += line + " " + function + " " + progname + " (" + objname
        + ")\n";
    } else {
      str += line + " " + function + " " + progname + "\n";
    }
  }

  send_message("Runtime error: " + str);
  if(caught == 0 && this_user() && (obj=this_user()->query_user())) {
    obj->message(str);
  }
  write_file("/error.log", str);
}
</pre>

    <p> Of course all of these errors have the caveat mentioned above
      &mdash; they can get lost since nobody may be receiving messages
      when they trigger.  For that reason, I <i>strongly</i> recommend
      checking your system log -- &quot;/error.log&quot; for the above
      code.  Basically, any time something fails silently see if new
      stuff got tacked onto that file. </p>

    <p> You'll also need to add your errord to your initd.c.  So over in
      &quot;/usr/System/initd.c&quot; go ahead and add some lines: </p>

<pre>
  if(!find_object("/usr/System/sys/errord")) {
    compile_object("/usr/System/sys/errord");
  }
  driver->set_error_manager(find_object("/usr/System/sys/errord"));
</pre>

    <p>
      (&quot;driver&quot; should point to your driver object or you
      should replace it with the path to the driver.) </p>

    <p>
      I do this after registering the telnet manager but
      do things in an order that works for you.  Remember the earlier in
      the sequence you start up the errord the more things you can
      have it help you debug. </p>

    <p> So that's it?  Not quite.  Some itty-bitty other stuff: </p>

      <ul>
	<li> Make sure to include &lt;kernel/kernel.h&gt; and
	  &lt;trace.h&gt; from your file -- some of the symbols that
	  the stolen code above uses will require them.  Usually
	  you'll need trace.h any time you play with call traces. </li>
	<li> Be aware that if your error handler causes errors
	  you'll probably have problems. </li>
	<li> With compile errors you'll tend to get a string of them
	  followed by a runtime error.  Expect this.  It's your friend. </li>
      </ul>

    <p> So go ahead and put this together and after a little debugging
      and other poking it should run.  If you haven't seen it do its
      thing yet, you can type something like
      &quot;code ({ &quot;bob&quot; }) [7] &quot; which will cause a
      nice little &quot;Array index out of range&quot; error with stack
      trace.  Have a look in /error.log, and you should see something
      like this: </p>

<pre>
Array index out of range [caught]
  46 receive_message   /kernel/obj/telnet (#25)
 226 receive_message   /kernel/lib/connection (/kernel/obj/telnet#25)
 227 receive_message   /usr/System/obj/user (#26)
  37 input             /usr/System/obj/wiztool (#27)
 734 call_limited      /kernel/lib/auto (/usr/System/obj/wiztool#27)
  97 process           /usr/System/obj/wiztool (#27)
 849 cmd_code          /kernel/lib/wiztool (/usr/System/obj/wiztool#27)
  10 exec              /usr/admin/_code
</pre>

    <h3> Specific Projects </h3>

    <p> So what can you do from here?  Lots of things.  We've mentioned
      some possibilities in the article itself, but quick projects include:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li> Fix up the formatting of the errors and make them more readable
	  </li>
	<li> Tell all admins logged in that an error has occurred and if
	  possible who caused it.  You may want to let them later query
	  the error and get the stack. </li>
	<li> Make this work with atomic functions.  Remember that you
	  can't write to a file inside an atomic function so if somebody
	  is catching an error in an atomic function you can't write
	  to the error log! </li>
      </ul>

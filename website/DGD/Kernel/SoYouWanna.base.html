    <h1> So You Want to Write a MUDLib </h1>
    <h3>(based on the Kernel MUDLib)</h3>

    <p> I'm assuming you already know basically what DGD is.  I'm assuming
      you already know what a MUDLib is.  If you don't, please carefully
      read the <a href="http://cie.imaginary.com/LPMud/lpmud_faq.html">
	LPMUD FAQ</a> and look up stuff on the web until you've got a clear
      idea what a driver and a MUDLib are, and whether LPC is a language
      you'd like to learn more about. </p>
    <p> That last bit is important.  If you're not much of a programmer,
      there's a serious chance that the Kernel MUDLib isn't for you.
      It's solid, secure and well-written.  The
      <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> folks use it, and that's
      high praise indeed!  But it's also very much designed for programmers.
      If you're up for learning the basics of LPC but you're not much of a
      programmer, perhaps the 2.4.5 or Melville
      MUDLib will be easier for you.  Have a look at the
      <a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/">DGD FAQ</a> or
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD/">my page</a>
      to find out
      more about them, or go for something easier than DGD and
      have a look at <a href="http://www.mudos.org">MudOS</a>,
      <a href="http://www.circlemud.org">CircleMUD</a>, or any of the
      other fine MUD source code bases out there.  But if you're a good
      programmer, or if you're willing to sweat blood to learn, read on! </p>

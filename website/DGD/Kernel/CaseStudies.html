    <h3> Security Case Studies Within and Around the Kernel MUDLib </h3>

    <p> The best way to show you how one secures objects in a MUDLib is
      to look at examples of successful security precautions, and
      examples of securing objects with problems.  DGD's Kernel MUDLib
      is an amazingly airtight piece of work, and so we'll use it
      for many of the success cases, and use programs that extend it
      to demonstrate the correction of security problems. </p>

    <h2> Names in the Kernel User Object </h2>

    <p> An interesting phenomenon may be noted if one examines
      /kernel/obj/user.c and its parent program /kernel/lib/user.c.
      Each has a string called &quot;name&quot;.  This string is
      private in /kernel/lib/user.c and public in /kernel/obj/user.c.
      Why? </p>

    <p> Making the variable private with no setter function in
      /kernel/lib/user.c makes it secure even from its own child
      class.  Had it not been declared private, then a child
      class could be declared which could access the variable.  The
      use of the login() method in /kernel/lib/user.c demonstrates
      that the name variable is meant to be set once and only
      once, never changed, and at some point logout() will be
      called.  This secures /kernel/lib/user's copy of name from
      child classes like /kernel/obj/user. </p>

    <p> So why's it matter?  The simplest reason is that it keeps
      the name variable from being modified.  If a child class
      modified it, then the values passed to USERD->login and
      USERD->logout would be different, causing problems for
      USERD and leaving an old login corresponding to no existing
      connection. </p>

    <p> We don't worry as much about login not being called as
      we might -- that case will still leave an extra spurious
      login which will need to be removed -- because the
      USERD checks to see if connections have been closed and
      because all of this can only be called from trusted
      system code. </p>

    <p> Even so, with a good objectd this example could be made even
      more secure -- the objectd could inform objects when they're
      destructed which would allow /kernel/lib/user to potentially
      know to logout automatically, probably with a warning message,
      if it wasn't logged out already when destructed. </p>

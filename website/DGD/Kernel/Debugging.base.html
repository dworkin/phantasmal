<h1>Debugging and the Kernel MUDLib</h1>

<h2>Tracking Down Weird Issues</h2>

<p>Absolutely the first thing you'll find yourself doing once you
start hacking together your MUDLib is seeing errors and wondering
where they're coming from. This little guide will help you on your
first faltering steps at tracking these things down. It's far from
complete or comprehensive, but every little bit helps. There's a
saying about documentation being like sex which I'll omit for the
moral betterment of the under-14 crowd.</p>

<p>You'll want a stack crawl before you get anything else. Often
that'll be enough. Once you've got the stack crawl and found the
line it's on, the line may be simple or complex, but there are the
usual problems and the usual attempts to fix them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Divide the line up into more operations</li>

  <li>Do some of the things on the line on a prior line to see if
  they break</li>

  <li>Add a harmless line before the line to see if it's actually a
  previous bug, not on the line you see the complaint for</li>

  <li>Try some alternate ways to do the same operation</li>

  <li>Pray</li>
</ul>

<p>You know the drill.</p>

<p>So what if your stack crawl does work so well? You may have the
problem down to a single operation &mdash; say a compile_object
&mdash; and it's failing. Why? There are a number of resources you
can try. If it's a driver or auto operation, you can look it up
<a href="Auto_API.html">here</a> for possible helpful hints. If
not, you can grep through the Kernel MUDLib sources or even the DGD
sources for hints. You can also ask the mailing list, naturally,
though we recommend you try all other likely choices first.</p>

<p>What if you get a stack crawl but it leads to an ugly dead end?
One common one is that you get to a DGD built-in operation like
::compile_object() in the driver or AUTO object. In that case, grep
through .../dgd/src/comp/*.c for the error message. It works for me
quite often. It's not always quite clear what the problem is
though...</p>

<p>Or what if you hit a try/catch statement? There are several in
the AUTO and driver objects. I recommend editing them to remove the
try/catch, at least for debugging purposes. This works especially
well if you have a source control system like <a href=
"http://www.bitkeeper.com">BitKeeper</a> in place. You can edit the
AUTO or driver object, play with it, debug some more, and revert
the changes when you feel like it. The BitKeeper plug is just
gratuitous &mdash; I really like their software, but I don't work
for them. Anyway.</p>

<p>To conclude, I'm going to give a list of some especially
irritating or cryptic messages I've encountered and what they
actually mean. As time progresses, I expect that more and more
pretty innocuous ones will sneak in along with the irritating ones,
slowly growing more comprehensive. Feel free to submit your own, to
the mailing list or to me personally!</p>

<h2>Error Messages I Have Known And Loved (ERMIHKAL)</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Cannot inherit XXX</dt>

  <dd>This could conceivably mean an error in the DGD driver, but
  usually it means that the driver inherit_program function has
  returned the dreaded nil. Why might it do that? Common reasons
  include inheriting something without /lib/ in the name,
  inheriting a /kernel object without being under /usr/System, not
  having read access to the object you're trying to inherit, or
  your objectd's forbid_inherit returning true on the offending
  file.</dd>

  <dt>Cannot clone XXX</dt>

  <dd>See <a href="Auto_API.html">this</a> under clone_object.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>What Does the Kernel Library Actually Do?</h2>

<p>DGD is able to fully recompile all code in place, if you meet
certain restrictions. The Kernel Library, used properly, makes sure
that you obey those restrictions. There's no way to violate them,
in fact, if you don't modify anything under &frasl;kernel, because
the Kernel Library simply won't allow you to. So the Kernel Library
helps make sure that all your code can be upgraded instantly and
in-place.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library also provides security. If you've got code
and data files in your directories, you'd like it if other
administrators and builders can't change them, and for some of the
files, you don't want other admins (or their objects and programs)
to be able to read them. The Kernel Library prevents that, not only
for your files but also for your compiled programs running in
memory. That means you don't need to worry as much about trusting
other administrators in the game, since they can't mess up your
stuff.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library also provides certain kinds of object
management support and user management support. You can register an
object manager with the library, and the Kernel Library will call
hook functions in your object manager whenever files are compiled,
inherited or included so that you can do the rest of the work
necessary to upgrade every object in place (you can also use
somebody else's object manager, but it still needs the Kernel
Library). The Kernel Library will keep track of user connections
and disconnections, and provide you with a nice interface to it.
There are similar facilities to track errors, and cause all
programs to implicitly inherit an AUTO-type object of your
choice.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library will also keep track of resource usage for
every administrator in the game. The amount of memory space and
processor time and the number of DGD objects are tracked
automatically, as are several more obscure commodities. It's easy
to add more resource tracking for things like in-game money or
power of monsters to keep your administrators and their areas from
spawning too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>There are some additional functions defined by the Kernel
Library for creating signals which an object can send and other
objects can subscribe to. That allows for various events occurring,
and provides an infrastructure to make it happen in code.</p>

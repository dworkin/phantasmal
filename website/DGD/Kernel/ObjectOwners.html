    <h1> Object Creators and Owners </h1>

    <h3> What is an Object's Creator? </h3>

    <p> Finding an object's creator is easy.  The object's name will
      usually start with /usr/XXX.  That XXX is the object's creator
      as far as the Kernel MUDLib is concerned. </p>

    <h3> Who Owns the Object? </h3>

    <p> The Kernel MUDLib occasionally does things with objects
      according to who owns them.  The owner is, conceptually, the user
      who called clone_object() or the equivalent.  But it's a little
      trickier than that. </p>

    <p> Say you've just entered a command which causes an object to be
      cloned.  You're the current user, but you're using code in
      (for instance) /usr/System to run the command.  So who owns the
      new object, you or System?  </p>

    <p> Say it's not a clone?  Does that make a difference?  Yup.  If
      an object isn't a clone then the creator is also the owner.  For
      instance, that's true if it's the original compiled clonable
      object, or if it's a library. </p>

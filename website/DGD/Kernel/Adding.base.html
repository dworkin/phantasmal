<h2>Adding Stuff to your MUDLib</h2>

<p>So you've got a good start on a MUDLib, either by <a href=
"Modifying.html">modifying the Kernel MUDLib</a> directly or with the
help of <a href="../external/System.zip">Shevek's BBLib</a>. You're
rip-roaring to go and you've even been adding a few little extra
features here and there. Great! Welcome to the ever-expanding community
of DGD MUDLib authors. We're happy to hear from you on the mailing list,
we're happy you're out there, and we look forward to your contributions
to the set of MUDLibs we can study and use!</p>

<p>What can we do to help you? Well, for starters we can suggest some
things you should do to keep your MUDLib usable, featureful and secure
-- and believe me, doing all that at once is <i>hard</i>! The <b>Adding
Stuff to your MUDLib</b> section on the previous page is here to help
you figure out some things you should put in your MUDLib. It can't tell
you everything. The things that make your MUDLib different and special
are the things we'd never think of because only <i>you</i> have the
vision to make them happen. But we can help you fix some common problems
and avoid some common pitfalls.</p>

<h2>About "Adding Stuff"</h2>

<p>In this series of documents we'll try to talk about security pretty
regularly. We tend to assume that you're going to have some
not-really-trusted people running code. That may be your users but more
often it'll be admins or builders you've given access to so they can
build areas. They may or may not be fully trustworthy but even the best
programmer can have a bad day now and again. When that happens it's best
if your MUDLib is robust enough to handle it. It can make sure that the
worst they get is a nasty error message on their command line while the
MUD chugs along with nary a hitch for the other users. It's not really
possible to make that happen <i>all</i> the time, especially with your
highest-level admins, but we can keep you from tripping over the wrong
thing quite a lot of the time if you're willing to code carefully. DGD
is just that cool.</p>

<p>That also means that if you're only going to give coding rights to
people you absolutely trust and who would be allowed to bring your
entire MUD crashing down around your ears and destroying all your data
if they felt like it... Well, then you can ignore pretty much all our
security advisories. Your MUDLib won't be the first to do so.</p>

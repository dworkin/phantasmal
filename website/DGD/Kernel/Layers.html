    <h1> The Layers Beneath the MUD </h1>

    <h3> The DGD Driver and the basics of the MUDLib </h3>

    <p> The DGD driver presents a series of layers of functionality.  What
      kind of stuff <i>you</i> think DGD does depends on what layer you see.
      Lets briefly dissect the layers between the DGD Kernel MUDLib and the
      OS you're running on. </p>

    <p> At the lowest, scariest, hardwariest level that you can still
      call DGD, you have the DGD driver itself.  The DGD driver is
      written in C, and is an interpreter for a language called LPC
      that looks kinda similar, but not <i>very</i> similar.  If you
      download DGD from the official web site, this is what you're
      compiling, probably after applying a lot of patches.  It's not
      very well documented, but it <i>is</i> very solidly written.
    </p>

    <p> You can just directly hack the source code if you don't care
      about being compatible or getting Dworkin's updates.  That means
      hacking DGD just like any other application on your OS of
      choice.  If you don't <i>fully</i> understand what I mean by all
      this or if you don't have much experience writing programs on
      the machine you're sitting in front of, then this isn't the
      level you want to work at.  Even if you do, it probably still
      isn't. </p>

    <p> DGD has an interface for <b>extensions</b>, which are pieces
      of code that make the driver do new things without breaking the
      old ones.  This is <i>still</i> a lot like hacking the driver,
      and it can still cause big-time problems.  If you write your
      code this way and you <i>ever</i> have to change it, you'll need
      to bring your server down to fix it.  That means you're ruining
      some of that persistence that DGD works so hard to give you.
      This is something you'll have to do in a few cases, but mainly
      you should leave it well enough alone. </p>

    <p> The driver and extensions (mentioned above) provide various
      DGD kernel functions, also called kfuns.  These are the
      functions that the lowest-level MUDLib code uses to present more
      interesting services to your LPC code.  Kernel functions do
      things like allocate memory, generate random numbers, give
      security information, return basic driver constants and do
      network I/O.  They don't look much like a game, MUD or
      otherwise.  In fact, it's more like a little Operating System
      and its system calls.  Here's the list of them as of DGD 1.2.71: </p>
      <pre>
acos            call_other       find_object      new_object        sin
allocate        call_out         floor            object_name       sinh
allocate_float  call_touch       fmod             parse_string      sizeof
allocate_int    call_trace       frexp            pow               sqrt
asin            ceil             function_object  previous_object   sscanf
asn_add         clone_object     get_dir          previous_program  status
asn_and         compile_object   hash_crc16       query_editor      strlen
asn_cmp         cos              hash_crc32       query_ip_name     swapout
asn_div         cosh             hash_md5         query_ip_number   tan
asn_lshift      crypt            hash_sha1        random            tanh
asn_mod         ctime            implode          read_file         this_object
asn_mult        decrypt          ldexp            remove_call_out   this_user
asn_or          destruct_object  log              remove_dir        time
asn_pow         dump_state       log10            remove_file       typeof
asn_rshift      editor           make_dir         rename_file       users
asn_sub         encrypt          map_indices      restore_object    write_file
asn_xor         error            map_sizeof       save_object
atan            exp              map_values       send_datagram
atan2           explode          millitime        send_message
block_input     fabs             modf             shutdown
      </pre>

    <p> If you use an LPC driver other than DGD (such as MudOS) you'll
      find that these functions are very different.  Another driver's
      functions will look more like the basics of a game and less like
      an operating system.  DGD is designed to work as pretty much any
      kind of network server, not just as a MUD.  People have written
      servers for HTTPD in DGD, and Yahoo Chat runs on top of it.  All
      of that means that DGD MUDLibs have to do a lot more to give a
      game environment. </p>

    <p> Of course, that also means that if you want
      to make a MUD that doesn't act at all like traditional MUDs then
      DGD is the driver for you -- it doesn't force you to use any of
      the regular MUD functions that you no don't need or want.  So if
      you want a MUD with no object or room data structures at all
      (maybe you just have particles everywhere and you figure it all
      out from that!), DGD provides you a simple, clean interface with
      nothing extra to trip you up or slow you down.
    </p>

    <p> Above the level of the DGD driver kfuns is your MUDLib,
      written in LPC.  Your LPC will translate the raw kfuns above
      into something you can use more easily.  However, the kfuns
      above can require a lot of supporting infrastructure, and that's
      where the DGD Kernel MUDLib can help you.  It sits above the
      kfuns and below your own MUDLib. </p>

    <p> You may find that if you try to write code that uses the
      kernel functions above in the way they're documented by DGD that
      you can't -- you may be denied permission, or you may even be
      told you're calling with the wrong number of arguments.  That's
      because the only part of a MUDLib that can directly use DGD's
      driver kfuns are special objects called the driver object and
      the auto object.  If the auto object decides to change how a
      function works then all the other code gets their version, not
      version from the DGD driver. </p>

    <p> The Kernel MUDLib overrides a number of these so that it can
      perform more security checking, which is good for the MUD
      administrator -- security can keep the builders and other
      wizards from being able to do Bad Things, at least if you use it
      consistently and intelligently. </p>

    <p> The Kernel MUDLib, like basically every MUDLib, overrides some
      of these and provides new ones.  The Kernel MUDLib <i>still</i>
      doesn't look very much like a MUD because it's really designed
      to let you build a MUDLib on top of, not to be the primary
      MUDLib for your game.  Some MUDLibs, such as the 2.4.5 MUDLib
      and Melville, provide you more of a game.  With the Kernel
      MUDLib, you'll need to build it. That's okay.  The Skotos folks
      do just exactly that, <a
      href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">so do I</a>, and you
      can too. </p>

    <p> In fact, for everything I'm writing here, I'm
      assuming you'll be building on top of the Kernel MUDLib.
      That'll mean that if you're using Melville or 2.4.5 there will
      be differences, and if you're just building on top of raw DGD
      there'll be even more.  Those are all fine places to start, but
      in <i>this</i> document it's all Kernel. </p>

    <p> And that's why you're here.  At least, that's why you're
      reading this page.  It's because you want to write a MUD and
      you're brave enough to start from the best around (DGD and the
      kernel MUDLib) even if that's much harder than using something
      that's already written and polished for you.  Congratulations!
      </p>

    <h3> DGD Kernel Functions </h3>

    <p> The kernel functions are documented in your DGD distribution
      in dgd/doc/kfun.  Second, for whatever MUDlib you're using,
      these documents may be inaccurate.  Read the overview above to
      find out why DGD's raw kernel functions may not be the same ones
      that you use from the Kernel MUDLib. </p>

    <p> So first, we should have a look at the functions that the
      Kernel MUDLib overrides and the new ones it provides.  You can
      find it for yourself in directories under
      &quot;dgd/mud/doc/kernel&quot;, but here's a quick list,
      up-to-date for 1.2.71: </p>
      <pre>
Lfuns:
allow_subscribe  create  query_owner

Efuns:
add_event     compile_object   find_object             remove_event
call_limited  destruct_object  get_dir                 status
call_other    event            new_object              subscribe_event
call_trace    event_except     query_events            unsubscribe_event
clone_object  file_info        query_subscribed_event
      </pre>

    <p> If you're paying attention, you'll have figured out that that means
      the functions the Kernel MUDLib actually overrides are: </p>
      <pre>
call_other            compile_object         get_dir
call_trace            destruct_object        new_object
clone_object          find_object            status
      </pre>

    <p> The other ones are all new. </p>

    <p> There are also special interfaces called hooks.  Certain
      methods, such as set_object_manager, can be called on particular
      objects and later on, that object will call functions within the
      object manager you provided it.  That means it needs to call
      functions it knows all about, so you'll need to have given it an
      object manager with all the functions it needs.  That's how
      hooks work.  Luckily, the Kernel MUDLib documents the different
      hooks and what kind of object you'll need to give them pretty
      well.  You can find the documentation in
      mud/doc/kernel/hook. </p>

<h1>DGD Kernel Library Information</h1>

<p>When writing your Kernel-based MUD library, make sure you've
read the <a href="../LibWriting/index.html">general help</a> for
writing a DGD MUDLib, which apply to your Kernel-based lib as
well.</p>

command names, but leaves them otherwise basically unmodified.</p>

<h3>Slush Bin</h3>

<p>There is an archive of <a href="EmailArchive.html">lots of
interesting email messages about the Kernel Library</a>. There's
also one about <a href="../SlushBucket.html">DGD in general, not
just the Kernel Lib</a>.</p>

<p>These directories grow organically. Feel free to request that I
expand any section and I will give it correspondingly higher
priority than would otherwise be the case. All information under
the Kernel subdirectory may be assumed to be in the public domain,
and I reserve no rights to it nor do I provide a warranty of any
kind.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%">This document aims to get you started
dealing with the Kernel MUDLib, and eventually explain vast amounts
about it. Any of the pages linked under here may be assumed to deal
with the Kernel MUDLib, and will thus likely be different when
dealing with Melville, 2.4.5, Gurba or other MUDLibs not based on
the Kernel MUDLib. Other people are welcome to document such
things, but the part of my site under the Kernel subdirectory makes
a point of not doing so.</p>

<p style="font-size: 75%">This document includes information from
correspondence on the <a href=
"http://www.dworkin.nl/mailman/listinfo/dgd">DGD Mailing List</a> .
Further information of many kinds is available on the <a href=
"http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/">official DGD homepage</a> . This
documents is current as of Kernel library 1.2.35, an experimental
version. Little information should be more obsolete than that, but
much information may be different because of the quirks of an
experimental version of DGD. Don't assume that this is fully
accurate for your version, whether it's newer or older than the one
above.</p>

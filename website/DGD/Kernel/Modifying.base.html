<h1>Modifying the DGD Kernel Library</h1>

<p>An alternative to this document would be just getting going
<i>fast</i> with Shevek's simple MUDLib <a href=
"http://www.google.com">BBLib v1.0b</a> building on the Kernel
MUDLib.</p>

<p>Paths in this document will often be given relative to the dgd
directory. So the Kernel MUDLib will be in the directory "/mud",
the top-level docs in "/doc", and the "mud.dgd" file is
"./mud.dgd". Also, the paths given tend to only be valid in the
source distribution. If you're hacking a MUDLib, you <i>did</i> get
the source distribution rather than binary, right?</p>
<hr>

<h3>Getting Started with the Kernel MUDLib</h3>

<p>You've probably got a head full of ideas about all the cool
stuff you're going to have on your MUD. Good for you! Write it all
down somewhere safe, because there's a lot of work between now and
when you start building things like that. But <i>do</i> keep it in
mind -- you'd like your MUD's MUDLib and architecture to fit your
eventual goals. Never use anything from this page or anyplace else
blindly, always look at it and figure it out first.</p>

<p>First, you'll need to compile DGD and run it with the Kernel
MUDLib. If you don't run it unmodified, you don't know whether
<i>you</i> broke anything. You'll need to build the DGD driver
binary, which will probably be called "driver". You'll need to
modify "/mud.dgd", mainly to give it the absolute (not relative)
path of your MUDLib. To begin with, you can build right on top of
the Kernel MUDLib in your DGD directory, so use a path like
"/home/mudMaster/dgd/mud" (that's if you installed DGD in
"/home/mudMaster/dgd"). Finally you'll want to run the driver with
the path (it can be relative) to mud.dgd as an argument. Be careful
of symbolic links in all this, they can sometimes cause problems
&mdash; make sure your setup works without them first.</p>

<p>Once you've got it running, you'll want to log in as admin by
telnetting to the machine running the MUD (127.0.0.1 if it's the
local machine) and typing "admin" in response to the login prompt.
I recommend you do it all lower case, at least to start out with --
the Kernel MUDLib has some problems along these lines which you'll
be fixing for your own MUDLib.</p>

<p>You can change the password with the passwd command, but with
the plain vanilla Kernel lib, only Wizard accounts can use their
passwords. Now log in with a couple of other accounts and start
typing things like "say Hello?" and "emote grins." If you're at all
used to MUDs, this'll look a lot like a gossip channel. The admin
character can do some pretty spiffy stuff, which you can find out
more about <a href="Commands.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, yes, the preceding is incomplete and vague. That's
because if you're not good enough to build and play with the Kernel
MUDLib in the first place and without my help (you <i>have</i> read
Dworkin's docs already, <i>right</i>?) then you probably shouldn't
be here. At least, not yet. Do that first, then come back here and
grin about how easy it's all become.</p>

<h3>The Kernel MUDLib and File Layout</h3>

<p>The Kernel MUDLib, out of the box, ships with a little directory
structure for you to use. It looks like this:</p>
<pre>
doc/ include/ kernel/ log/ txt/ usr/
</pre>

<p>I'm putting the little slashes after each name to mean it's a
directory. On Unix, if you type "ls -F" you'll see the same thing.
It just distinguishes the file type visually, which happens to be
convenient for me.</p>

<p>The doc directory is for you to put documentation on the MUDLib
you're building. If you ever plan to have another human being work
on your MUD it's vitally important that you do that. You may
believe you can just hack some quick docs together when you need
them, but you're the <i>only</i> one who believes it. Write them.
Write lots. And put them in "/doc".</p>

<p>The include directory is for headers. This includes some headers
DGD generates automatically for you like type.h and float.h. It
includes some headers you'll probably want to edit, like config.h.
It includes a whole subdirectory, kernel, which you shouldn't touch
under pretty much any circumstances. Which brings me to another
point.</p>

<p>This document assumes that, like Skotos, you've got the presence
of mind to leave the Kernel MUDLib absolutely intact. That's not
saying you have to keep your MUDLib down to just that -- the Kernel
MUDLib has lots of hooks to let you entirely customize what it
does. <b>But</b>, the underlying library itself stands inviolate,
not unlike your Operating System underneath the program you're
running. Even if it would be easier for you to just tweak the OS to
add a feature instead of adding it to your program, it's just
<i>not</i> a good idea. The Kernel MUDLib should be treated the
same way.</p>

<p>That brings us to the kernel directory. In this directory, the
Kernel MUDLib itself resides. The auto and driver objects you've
heard so much about reside under "/kernel/lib/auto.c" and
"/kernel/sys/driver.c", respectively. The rest of the Kernel MUDLib
can be thought of us just providing support for what those files
do, and what you ask for. This is the directory you don't want to
change stuff under. Just to drive the point home, the Kernel MUDLib
makes it much harder for your MUD to change stuff under here. I'll
explain how when I explain security.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Getting your MUDLib Set Up</h3>

<p>First, you'll want to read some documentation. Starting to
notice a theme here? That's because well-written, secure, tight,
careful MUDLibs are in short supply, and I'm willing to browbeat
you throughout this document if there's a chance it'll give us all
just one more of those. MUDLibs like that are written by,
coincidentally, people who read lots of documentation. Now go ahead
and grin, you.</p>

<p>That documentation would be "/mud/doc/kernel/overview". It's the
best documentation currently available (except, I hope, these
pages) on how to build your own MUDLib on top of the Kernel MUDLib.
And it ships with - drum roll please - the Kernel MUDLib. Is
Dworkin on top of things or what?</p>

<p>Remember <a href="#hooks">hooks</a> from before? You're going to
need to make some objects with very specific functions in them for
the Kernel MUDLib to call. The overview mentions this, especially
in section 9. Let's get started.</p>

<p>Open up a text editor and create the file
"/mud/usr/System/initd.c". If you're looking at the right place,
the "mud/usr/System" directory should already be there waiting for
you, you'll just create a new empty file.</p>

<p>In that brand spanking new file, put the following:</p>
<pre>
static int create(varargs int clone) {

}
</pre>

<p>Now run the MUD again. Nothing changes, nothing breaks, right?
Now add a line inside the create function above. Make it look like
this:</p>
<pre>
static int create(varargs int clone) {
  write_file("/log.txt", "Successful initd.c test\n");
}
</pre>

<p>After that, you should find a file in "/mud/log.txt" that says
"Successful initd.c test". And you just created it by starting up
the MUD. That's how cool you are. This new file of yours is how
you're going to set up all the cool stuff that makes your MUDLib
different from the Kernel MUDLib. And the way you're going to do
that is by returning a network connection object that you wrote and
that you control.</p>

<p>The way you're going to do <i>that</i> is to add a Telnet
Manager object in your initd.c, which will return your connection,
not the default system one. So let's make a telnetd.c that'll do
just exactly that. After you've looked over the docs on the Telnet
Manager in "/mud/doc/kernel/userd", you'll realize what kinds of
functions your telnet manager will have to have. You can start with
one in "/usr/System/sys/telnetd.c" that looks like this:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;kernel/user.h&gt;
#include &lt;config.h&gt;

static void create(varargs int clone) {
  if(!find_object(DEFAULT_USER)) { compile_object(DEFAULT_USER); }
}

object select(string str)
{
  return clone_object(DEFAULT_USER);
}

int query_timeout(object connection)
{
  return DEFAULT_TIMEOUT;
}

string query_banner(object connection)
{
  return "Welcome to BoboMUD!  What's yer name? ";
}
</pre>

<p>DEFAULT_USER is the user object that the Kernel MUDLib supplies
you with from the get-go. Later you'll be supplying your own user
object, but first you'll figure out what the telnetd object is and
what it does. On that note, you'll also need to make some changes
to your initd.c to make it recognize and use your lovely new
telnetd.c, which is otherwise just another lonely, untouched file
on your hard drive. To do that, fix up your initd.c to look like
this:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;kernel/kernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;config.h&gt;

static int create(varargs int clone) {
  object driver;
  object telnet_manager;

  write_file("/log.txt", "Successful initd.c test\n");

  /* For later, when you start setting more managers */
  driver = find_object(DRIVER);

  if(!find_object("/usr/System/sys/telnetd")) {
    compile_object("/usr/System/sys/telnetd");
  }
  telnet_manager = find_object("/usr/System/sys/telnetd");
  "/kernel/sys/userd"-&gt;set_telnet_manager(0, telnet_manager);
}
</pre>

<p>Start the MUD up, telnet to it and - rapture! - it says "Welcome
to BoboMUD! What's yer name?" just like it's supposed to.</p>

<p>(If it doesn't, make sure you're running a *very* recent
experimental version of Phantasmal. The line with
"set_telnet_manager" above used to not require that zero in front,
but now it does. That could screw you up)</p>

<p>But all is not well in paradise. Tell it your name is Bob (or
Sam, or Frederick, or a name of your choice) and it'll tell you
that Access is Denied, and give you a stack dump. You should read
it: the dumps read bottom to top, which is to say that the function
you actually crashed in is the lowest line, the one that called it
is one line above that, its caller is one line higher and so
on.</p>

<p>If you actually check out "/kernel/lib/auto.c" (line 400 for my
version of the MUDLib) you'll find that access is denied because
only Kernel objects can clone other Kernel objects. So you'll need
your own non-kernel User object to clone and return. That's okay,
you'll need to make your own user object before long anyway since
that's how you add new commands and otherwise change behaviors.</p>

<p>Start by copying the DEFAULT_USER -- that's
"/kernel/obj/user.c". You'll want to put it in
"/usr/System/obj/user.c". You'll need to change a few things to get
this to work.</p>

<p>First, go into /include/config.h and add a line like:</p>
<pre>
# define SYSTEM_USER  "/usr/System/obj/user"
</pre>

<p>This will allow you to refer to your spiffy new user object.
Then, in the user object itself look for places it says
DEFAULT_USER and change it to SYSTEM_USER. Don't change
DEFAULT_USER_DIR to anything else, though, keep it the same for
now. It may be a good idea to change later (see Adding Stuff to
your MUDLib), but for now keep it the same.</p>

<p>You'll also need to change your telnetd.c file to say
SYSTEM_USER wherever it used to say DEFAULT_USER, so that it clones
your user and not the Kernel MUDLib one.</p>

<p>Now log in with a couple of players and start using the say and
emote commands. Looks a lot like before you modified anything,
doesn't it? Nonetheless, it's now using your user. You win!</p>

<p>You're not out of the woods yet, though. Try logging in as
admin. Type anything for the password. It'll give you an Access
Denied, which will look like you got the wrong password. You
didn't. Instead, that Access Denied is because you're trying to
clone the Kernel MUDLib wiztool instead of one of your own, just
like the problem with your user object. You'll solve it the same
way, pretty much. Start by copying /kernel/obj/wiztool.c to
/usr/System/obj/wiztool.c.</p>

<p>You won't need to modify the wiztool object, but you *will* need
to add a line like</p>
<pre>
#define SYSTEM_WIZTOOL "/usr/System/obj/wiztool"
</pre>

<p>to /include/config.h. Then you'll need to change DEFAULT_WIZTOOL
to SYSTEM_WIZTOOL in two places in /usr/System/user.c. You'll also
need to find the create() function and either inside or outside the
if (doesn't matter) put the line:</p>
<pre>
if(!find_object(SYSTEM_WIZTOOL)) compile_object(SYSTEM_WIZTOOL);
</pre>

<p>That's because anything you want to clone you'll need to have
compiled first. One reason you might get "Cannot clone XXX" errors
is having not compiled the object you're trying to clone.</p>

<p>Having done all that, go ahead and log in. As a little
celebration you can type "compile /usr/System/obj/user.c" and watch
it come back with something like "$0 =
&lt;/usr/System/obj/user&gt;". This means it's successfully
recompiled that file on the fly. How cool does that make you?</p>

<p>You've now got something almost entirely comparable to Shevek's
BBLib. That's a good start, and it's nice to know. So you can move
on to adding more stuff to your MUDLib. The "Adding Stuff"
documents on <a href="index.html">my pages</a> will do their best
to show you how.</p>

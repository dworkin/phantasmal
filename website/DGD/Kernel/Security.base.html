<h1>Security and the Kernel MUDLib</h1>

<h3>Why does it apply to <i>me</i>?</h3>

<p>You may be thinking to yourself "I'll make <i>my</i> lib secure,
the Kernel MUDLib will be secure, everything will be just fine."
Worse yet, you <i>could</i> be thinking, "the Kernel MUDLib's
supposed to be really secure, so I just won't have to worry about
it." Neither of these is quite true, for reasons I'll go into
later.</p>

<p>Or you <i>could</i> be thinking, "I don't care if it's secure.
I'm never going to have any other wizards working on the MUD that I
don't trust." That's a more valid response, and in fact security
only saves you from malicious users, malicious wizards, and your
own mistakes. If you're fine being left wide open to crashes and
data loss of the last two categories then securing your MUDLib
<i>does</i> get easier.</p>

<p>But not trivial. It's important that you know what even your
users can do to you if you miscode commands. For that reason, you
need to understand how the Kernel MUDLib implements its security
model, and who it lets get away with what. Basically the Kernel
MUDLib only actually prevents a small number of things, it just
restricts the rest to trusted code. That's fine, but then you
<i>need</i> to know what code is trusted and what isn't.</p>

<h3>What code is trusted?</h3>

<p>The one-sentence answer is: "code in /usr/System is
trusted."</p>

<p>There's a lot more to it than that. The Kernel MUDLib's own code
is in /kernel, and it's trusted, and you should never, ever modify
it. The Kernel MUDLib will do its best to keep you from doing this
at runtime from a MUDLib written on top of it, but only you can
make sure you don't do so when the MUD's not running. You <i>do</i>
run the machine after all.</p>

<p>Also, trust is delegated in some other ways. There are
directories that are marked as globally readable, so anybody has
read access to them. That also means anybody can clone objects
whose code is in these directories, and several other things that
read access implies. Anybody has full read-write access to their
own directory -- for instance, a wizard named bob will always have
full access to /usr/bob, regardless. There are lots more little
rules like this that we'll hit on a case-by-case basis later.</p>

<p>You could write a function in /usr/System that is callable from
outside /usr/System. If it calls anything that requires trust and
then exports the results, you've just leaked some trust out into
the system at large.</p>

<p>That may be fine. You may have decided that anybody is allowed
to grab the list of clones of /usr/System/obj/room since those
clones do their own security-checking. In that case, you'd be doing
the right thing. You have to leak <i>some</i> trust out into the
system or nobody can do anything at all.</p>

<p>But it's important to understand what people can and can't do
with that information. For instance, in the example above, your
decision means that the code of /usr/System/obj/room.c must be
<i>absolutely bulletproof</i> if it's to be secure from misuse by
your wizards. For instance, say you kept around a function that
would remove an exit from a room but <i>didn't check who called
it</i>. If anybody can get the list of clones, then anybody can
remove any exit from any room, thus isolating your MUD's rooms from
each other. Instead, you'd want to make sure that only a wizard
with full access to the room (such as the one who owns the zone the
room is in) may remove an exit from it.</p>

<p>As an even more severe example, your object in /usr/System might
just keep an array of room clones, and return it to caller. So when
you return the room array an unscrupulous caller could remove
objects from the array. Now whenever somebody else calls the
function to get the array of objects, they won't see the objects
that were removed! Those clones have been entirely gotten rid
of.</p>

<p>Security is a big field, and I'm not going to be able to tell
you everything about it here. Even just DGD and LPC security
specifics is a pretty big field! But you'll need to know what
privileges your code has in order to avoid giving them away to
people that call your functions. So the most important thing these
pages can do is to describe what privileges and what restrictions
the Kernel MUDLib gives so you know what's what.</p>
<hr>

<h3>General Restrictions</h3>

<p>First off, I'll quote Bruce Schneier the security expert. He
says that "security is not something you can bolt onto an existing
product." He's right. The example with the array above should tell
you that you need to think about these things in advance. You may
just be able to copy the array every time, which is fine, but if
you already have code that depends on being able to modify it then
you have a massive headache with no good solutions. Think about
security <i>early</i>!</p>

<p>Now let's get down to things the Kernel MUDLib does differently
than base DGD. DGD itself does almost nothing to enforce access
control, though it's quite secure. By "quite secure" I mean it
doesn't use pointers, so if you don't give somebody access to
something they can't get at it -- they can't go "memory dumpster
diving" easily just because they share your same process. You
pretty much <i>can't</i> crash the machine although if you do
something sufficiently bad DGD won't know what to do and will stop
you.</p>

<p>The Kernel MUDLib adds another layer of robustness onto this. It
realizes that there is good, trusted code and bad, untrusted code
in the world, and that you're likely to have some of both in your
process. So it keeps track of users, and what those users can
access. It keeps track of programs (individual .c files) and
decides what <i>they</i> can access.</p>

<p>For reasons explained <a href="Inheritance.html">elsewhere</a>,
the Kernel MUDLib also adds the <b>library</b> or
<b>inheritable</b> abstraction. It decides that libraries aren't
regular objects like <b>clonables</b>. Instead, the Kernel MUDLib
will never pass you a "real" library object, only its path. That
means you can't keep storage space in one since you can never
create a clone or LWO of one, nor call it with <b>call_other</b>.
All you can really do with a library is to inherit it from your
other code, and in practice that's usually plenty. For situations
where it is not, it's pretty straightforward to simply create a
dummy clonable that does nothing but inherit the library.</p>

<h3>Specific Operations</h3>

<p>Note: all specifics given here are current as of DGD 1.2.35.
While the Kernel MUDLib tends to change very little, these
operations are, in fact, subject to change at any time by
Dworkin.</p>

<p>Also, this page details only exported APIs -- static and private
functions of the Driver object, for instance, aren't listed even
though DGD or the Driver itself may call them.</p>

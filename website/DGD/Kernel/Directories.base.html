<h1>Your MUDLib's Directory Structure</h1>

<p>Where do I <b>put</b> all this stuff?</p>

<p>You've probably asked yourself that several times already, just
getting started. When you make a new library, or a new clonable, or
a new data file, where do you <i>put</i> it? This document can get
you started.</p>

<p>Where you put stuff is surprisingly important. The Kernel MUDLib
hardcodes a <i>lot</i> of behavior according to the path to a given
file. That includes a lot of information about who has access to
what, and whether an object is inheritable, clonable or an LWO. So
let's hit some basic guidelines.</p>

<h2>Where do specific object types go?</h2>

<p>You'll need to put a "/lib/" directory somewhere in the path to
every library (inheritable). The Kernel MUDLib requires it. It's
good practice. It's good documentation. Do it. You'll also need to
<i>not</i> put "/obj/" or "/data/" anywhere in that path. For more
information about those paths, and whether an object is cloneable
or inheritable, see the page about <a href=
"Inheritance.html">Inheritance</a> in the Kernel Library. It'll
explain what's mandatory.</p>

<p>Daemons are objects like any others, but they're meant to be
used by doing a find_object on them and calling their methods with
call_other. Daemons often wind up in a directory with "/sys/" in
the name instead of "/lib/", "/data/" or "/obj/". This is purely
optional, mostly a form of documentation. You're just saying that
you plan to use objects in that directory as daemons. It's still a
good idea.</p>

<h2>What about Data?</h2>

<p>This one's important too, but for different reasons. You don't
need to have a particular piece of your path to open a file with
read_file(). But different paths require different permissions to
access. For instance, stuff in "/usr/System" is readable and
writable only by the privileged admin user (by default) and by
anybody you explicitly grant access to. In general, permissions are
given per-directory You'll want to set aside a place somewhere
under /usr/ to put any piece of data, because generally only code
in that same user's directory can read it (or everybody can, if you
put it in "/usr/Foo/open/").</p>

<p>Files with passwords in them are a good example. While passwords
are encrypted, they're not unbreakable, so often you want to avoid
giving people read access. That keeps them from using a password
cracking program, or at least makes it harder. You may need to give
certain wizards read access to the System directory but not want
them to be able to read all the save files. By putting the save
files somewhere else (say under /usr/Secret or something), you can
prevent anybody that doesn't have full admin permission from being
able to read or write the user data files. Note that you'll have to
write your password code carefully so that <i>it</i> can still read
it!</p>

<h2>What directories does the Kernel Library treat specially?</h2>

<p>The Kernel Library checks various things about the path in many
of its operations. Let's look at different operations, and what the
Kernel Library checks about the path for each one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A lot of Kernel MUDLib functions can only be called from
  objects under /usr/System. Objects under /usr/System are also
  allowed to read and write a lot of things automatically, without
  having to check permissions. They're also the only objects that
  can inherit from objects under /kernel. Only objects under
  /usr/System may destruct objects that they don't own, though even
  they can't destruct an object under /kernel. Only objects under
  /usr/System are allowed to call swapout(), dump_state(), and
  shutdown() usefully.</li>

  <li>Only objects <i>outside</i> the /usr/System directory can
  have a special nonstandard AUTO object.</li>

  <li>The /kernel and /include/kernel directories and their
  subdirectories are guaranteed writable to nobody. Files under
  /kernel or /include/kernel may not be written to or deleted.
  Directories cannot be made or destroyed there, and files cannot
  be renamed to or from those directories. Objects under /kernel
  can only be cloned by other objects under /kernel.</li>

  <li>You can't call_other on any object with /lib in its path. You
  can't find those objects with find_object(), you can't call their
  functions. You can only inherit objects with /lib in their paths
  and without /obj/ or /data/ in their paths.</li>

  <li>Files with /include in the path can always be included,
  regardless of read access. (TEST ME, with and without a '..' in
  the path)</li>

  <li>Files outside of /usr/System are allowed to have a special
  nonstandard AUTO object. If a non-System file includes AUTO from
  /include/std.h, and an objectd is registered, the Kernel Library
  will call the path_special() function of the objectd to determine
  what AUTO object should be used. If a value other than "" or nil
  is returned, it is assumed to be the path to the nonstandard AUTO
  object. This can be used for scripts or other controlled access
  since built-in functions can be overridden by an AUTO
  object.</li>

  <li>Objects in /kernel have no maximum rlimits(), so they could
  theoretically loop infinitely or crash for lack of stack space.
  In practice, this essentially never happens. Objects in
  /usr/System may voluntarily choose not to limit their number of
  ticks in rlimits(). This means they may occasionally loop
  infinitely, especially if coded poorly.</li>

  <li>Files outside /usr, or in /usr/foo/open (for any value of
  foo) are readable to everybody. Except stuff under /kernel/,
  that's not necessarily open to reading.</li>

  <li>A user has full access of every object and file under his own
  home directory. Objects under that user's directory have full
  access to each other, and to files under the user's home
  directory.</li>

  <li>The create() function that gets called automatically on an
  object will be called with the 'clone' argument only if /obj/ or
  /data/ is in the object's path. Otherwise it will be called with
  no argument.</li>

  <li>Libraries not under /kernel require you to have read access
  to compile them. Non-libraries, anything under /kernel, and
  anything compiled from sources requires write access instead of
  read access if you want to compile it. There's an exception if
  the object doing the compiling is under /usr/System. And anything
  not under a /usr/XXX directory can be compiled by anybody.</li>

  <li>An object must have an /obj/ in its path, but no /data/ or
  /lib/, to be clonable. Objects outside of the /usr/XXX/ area
  can't clone another object. Objects that aren't under /usr/System
  need read access to an object to clone it.</li>

  <li>Only objects in /usr/System can pass a uid argument to
  clone_object or new_object. That's a way to change who owns the
  new clone or LWO. You should probably never do this.</li>

  <li>An object to be cloned as an LWO with new_object must have
  /data/ in the path, but not /obj/ or /lib/.</li>

  <li>Objects outside of /usr/System get an edited call_trace, one
  with no arguments included.</li>

  <li>Objects outside of /usr/System don't get arguments in the
  output of status(), and nobody is allowed to see the callouts of
  objects in /kernel.</li>

  <li>Certain Kernel objects get direct call_outs rather than the
  usual tracked ones. If you don't know what this means, don't
  worry about it. You'll sleep better.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific Projects</h2>

<p>This is part of the Adding Stuff section, so what kind of stuff
should you add? One simple answer is "everything", since this
document tells you where everything goes. But there are also some
projects you can undertake to improve your MUDLib.</p>

<p>For instance, a simple thing you can do is to move your user
data from its current save location to another, as we suggest
above. Mainly you'll need to modify "user.c". Go give it a try!</p>

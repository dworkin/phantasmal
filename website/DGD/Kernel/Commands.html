    <h2> User Commands in the Stock Kernel Library </h2>

    <p>The Kernel MUDLib does very different things for regular users and
      wizards (those that have special access such as admin).  Let's look
      at how it works for a regular user first.</p>

    <p>A regular user is anybody that hasn't been specifically made a
      wizard.  The only exception is &quot;admin&quot;.  S/he is a wizard
      automatically just because s/he's got that name.  When a regular
      user logs in they don't need a password.  That's true only for the
      stock, unmodified kernel MUDLib but so is everything else on
      this page.  Like everything else here it can be modified if
      you <a href="index.html">muddle with the MUDLib</a>.</p>

    <p>The regular user can do a number of things.  S/he can use the
      <b>say</b> command to say stuff.  For instance: </p>

<pre>
      say Hello, all!
</pre>

    <p> S/he can use <b>emote</b> to do something similar.  If s/he types
      &quot;emote jumps for joy!&quot; and his/her name is Panda
      everybody will see &quot;Panda jumps for joy!&quot;.  If you're
      impatient you can abbreviate <b>say</b> with a single-quote and
      <b>emote</b> with a colon.  Just put either punctuation character
      at the front of a command line right where you'd type <b>say</b>
      or <b>emote</b>. </p>

    <p> To give a private message to somebody else you can <b>tell</b>
      them something.  For instance: &quot;tell Panda I'm happy
      too!&quot; will tell Panda how thrilled you are. </p>

    <p> To find out who's on the MUD you can type <b>users</b>.  It'll
      give you the list.  Then you can tell them things with the other
      commands. </p>

    <p> You can set your password with the password command, typed by
      itself, but that doesn't do anything useful unless you're a
      wizard. If you are then you can do this.  If you're not then you
      can still set the password but it does nothing useful.  You
      won't be asked for it on login. </p>

    <p> And you can quit.  Good to know.  You just type <b>quit</b>. </p>

    <hr />

    <h2> Wizard/Administrator Commands </h2>

    <p> The <b>code</b> command lets you execute a little snippet of code
      and get the value back.  DGD will automatically make a temporary
      object for you in a temporary file that executes your code.
      DGD even predeclares 26 one-letter lowercase variables of type
      <b>mixed</b> for you to use in your code just in case you need some
      temp vars.</p>

    <p> You can type <b>history</b> by itself or followed by a number
      to access
      the history of values your <b>code</b>, <b>compile</b> and
      <b>clone</b> commands have been returning.  You can access these
      values in the arguments of many commands by referring to them
      as $1, $2, $3, et cetera.</p>

    <p>The <b>clear</b> command clears the command history.</p>

    <p>The <b>compile</b> command recompiles an object.  Some objects
      won't like being recompiled - for instance if stuff inherits
      from them.  You give it the filename and it recompiles the file.
      You can just give the filename without the path if you're in the
      correct current directory.  See <b>cd</b>, <b>ls</b>,
      <b>pwd</b>, and so on for how to tell if you're in the correct
      directory.
    </p>

    <p>The <b>clone</b> command clones an object and puts it in the
      command history for your enjoyment and edification.  You can
      later take the <b>status</b> or <b>destruct</b> it.  Make sure
      to destruct what you create! </p>

    <p>The <b>destruct</b> command lets you destruct objects.  Doing
      so can be useful in your efforts to recompile inheritable
      (library) objects.  You're still better off with an object
      daemon doing it for you, but <b>destruct</b> will also help you
      test <i>that</i>.</p>

    <p><b>cd</b>, <b>pwd</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>cp</b>, <b>mv</b>,
      <b>rm</b>, <b>mkdir</b>, <b>rmdir</b>: these are just like the
      regular Unix shell commands of the same names.  For DOS or
      Windows guys: <b>ls</b> is <b>dir</b>.  <b>cp</b> is
      <b>copy</b>.  <b>mv</b> is <b>move</b>. <b>rm</b> is
      <b>del</b>. <b>pwd</b> tells your current directory.
      <b>mkdir</b> and <b>rmdir</b> are pretty much the same as in
      DOS.  <b>cd</b> is mostly the same, but typing just <b>cd</b> by
      itself doesn't print the directory.  Instead it changes to your
      home directory.  You can use all these commands from your OS
      instead of inside the MUD, but sometimes it's more convenient to
      have the command line right there. </p>

    <p>The <b>ed</b> command lets you edit a file using DGD's built-in
      editor.  Docs on how to use it come with DGD.  You can always
      just use the editor on your machine if you prefer.  However,
      Windows users take note: the DGD editor is guaranteed to have
      the right linebreak behavior and most Windows editors (like
      Visual Studio, Visual C++ or Notepad) aren't.  So the DGD
      built-in editor may be a good alternative to grabbing TextPad. </p>

    <p> If you're the admin, another advantage is that your MUD admins
      can have MUD accounts, but not shell accounts on the server box.
      They can use the DGD editor and get access only to the files
      they're supposed to, and not your Unix command line nor other
      people's files.  That's a cheaper, simpler (and worse)
      alternative to writing an FTP server into your MUD. </p>

    <p>You can use the <b>access</b> command on a wizard's name to
      find out what s/he can access.  You can use it with no argument
      to find out <i>your</i> access.  With the special string
      &quot;global&quot; you can find out what areas allow everybody
      read access.  You can use it on a file to find out who has what
      access to it. </p>

    <p><b>grant</b></p>

    <p><b>ungrant</b></p>

    <p>The <b>quota</b> command lists a wizard's resource usage.  With
      no arguments it gives the usages for the user that typed it.  With
      one argument it gives the usages for the wizard whose name is given.
      With two arguments it takes a wizard's name and a resource type
      (such as ticks, stack, callouts, etc) to give the usage for.  With
      three arguments of the form &quot;quota &lt;user&gt; &lt;rsrc&gt;
      &lt;limit&gt;&quot; it will try to set that user's limit on that
      resource to the number specified if you've got the necessary
      privilege to do that.  For most limits, -1 means infinite.
    </p>

    <p>The <b>rsrc</b> command typed by itself will show the MUD's total
      usage of the same resources <b>quota</b> affects.  This doesn't just
      show your usage.  It shows everybody's.
      With a resource name
      and a numerical limit <b>rsrc</b> will set the new limit to the
      given value.  With just a resource name <b>rsrc</b>
      will list the usage of that resource by all wizards. </p>

    <p>The <b>people</b> command is just a slightly beefier <b>users</b>
      command.
      It displays IP addresses of those logged in.</p>

    <p>The <b>status</b> command shows a little summary of driver status.
      Try it out and see!  You can also use it with an argument to get the
      status of an object.  Try some object names and some values from the
      history list. </p>

    <p>The <b>swapout</b> command will attempt to swap out all objects.
      This could be useful for testing, prior to a statedump, or when
      the MUD's RAM footprint is objectionably large and not many users
      are logged in. </p>

    <p>The <b>statedump</b> command will write out a dump of the MUD's
      current state which could be good for bootstrapping the MUD later,
      backing up in case of crashes, or duplicating the MUD and running
      another copy.</p>

    <p>The <b>shutdown</b> command attempts to shut down the MUD. </p>

    <p>The <b>reboot</b> command attempts to reboot the MUD. </p>

    <hr />

    <p> If you try many commands incorrectly they will give you usage
      information.  This may or may not tell you more about what the command
      does, but it'll at least tell you how you can try to find out! </p>

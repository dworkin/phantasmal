    <h2> User Commands </h2>

    <p>The Kernel MUDLib does very different things for regular users and
      wizards (those that have special access such as admin).  Let's look
      at how it works for a regular user first.</p>

    <p>A regular user is anybody that hasn't been specifically made a
      wizard.  The only exception is &quot;admin&quot;.  S/he is a wizard
      automatically just because s/he's got that name.  When a regular
      user logs in they don't need a password.  That's true only for the
      stock, unmodified kernel MUDLib but so is everything else on
      this page.  Like everything else here it can be modified if
      you <a href="index.html">muddle with the MUDLib</a>.</p>

    <p>The regular user can do a number of things.  S/he can use the
      <b>say</b> command to say stuff.  For instance:
<pre>
      say Hello, all!
</pre>
    </p>
    <p> S/he can use <b>emote</b> to do something similar.  If s/he types
      &quot;emote jumps for joy!&quot; and his/her name is Panda
      everybody will see &quot;Panda jumps for joy!&quot;.  If you're
      impatient you can abbreviate <b>say</b> with a single-quote and
      <b>emote</b> with a colon.  Just put either punctuation character
      at the front of a command line right where you'd type <b>say</b>
      or <b>emote</b>. </p>

    <p> To give a private message to somebody else you can <b>tell</b>
      them
      something.  For instance: &quot;tell Panda I'm happy too!&quot; will
      tell Panda that you're also thrilled. </p>

    <p> To find out who's on the MUD you can type <b>users</b>.  It'll give
      you the list.  Then you can tell them things. </p>

    <p> You can set your password with the password command, typed
      by itself, but that doesn't do anything useful unless you're a
      wizard. If you are then you can do this.  If you're not then you
      still can
      but it does nothing useful. </p>

    <p> And you can quit.  Good to know.  You just type quit. </p>

    <hr> </hr>

    <h2> Wizard/Administrator Commands </h2>

    <p> The <b>code</b> command lets you execute a little snippet of code
      and get the value back.  DGD will automatically make a temporary
      object for you in a temporary file that executes your code.
      DGD even predeclares 26 one-letter lowercase variables of type
      <b>mixed</b> for you to use in your code just in case you need some
      temp vars.</p>
    <p> You can type <b>history</b> by itself or followed by a number
      to access
      the history of values your <b>code</b>, <b>compile</b> and
      <b>clone</b> commands have been returning.  You can access these
      values in the arguments of many commands by referring to them
      as $1, $2, $3, et cetera.</p>
    <p>The <b>clear</b> command clears the command history.</p>

    <p>The <b>compile</b> command recompiles an object.  Some objects won't
      like being recompiled - for instance if stuff inherits from them.
      You give it the filename and it recompiles the file.  You can
      just give the filename without the path if you're in the correct
      current directory (see <b>cd</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>pwd</b>, and so on).
    </p>

    <p>The <b>clone</b> command clones an object and puts it in the command
      history for your enjoyment and edification.  It tests out your
      clone's create() function and you can later take the <b>status</b>
      or <b>destruct</b> it.  Make sure to destruct what you create! </p>

    <p>The <b>destruct</b> command lets you destroy objects.
      Doing so can be
      useful in your efforts to recompile inheritable (library) objects.
      You're still better off with an object daemon doing it for you,
      but <b>destruct</b>
      will also help you test <i>that</i>.</p>

    <p><b>cd</b>, <b>pwd</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>cp</b>, <b>mv</b>,
      <b>rm</b>, <b>mkdir</b>, <b>rmdir</b>:  these are just like
      the regular Unix shell commands of the same names.  For DOS
      or Windows guys <b>cd</b> is mostly the same. <b>ls</b> is <b>dir</b>.
      <b>cp</b> is <b>copy</b>.
      <b>mv</b> is <b>move</b>. <b>rm</b> is <b>del</b>. <b>pwd</b> tells
      your current directory.
      <b>mkdir</b> and <b>rmdir</b> are pretty much the same as in
      DOS.  One difference is that
      typing just <b>cd</b> by itself doesn't print the directory.
      Instead it changes
      to your home directory.  You can use all these commands from your
      OS instead of inside
      the MUD, but sometimes it's more convenient to have the command
      line right there. </p>
    <p>The <b>ed</b> command lets you edit a file using DGD's built-in
      editor.
      Docs on how to use it come with DGD.  You can always just use the
      editor on your machine if you prefer but the DGD one is guaranteed
      to have the right linebreak behavior and most Windows editors
      (like Visual Studio, Visual C++ or Notepad) aren't.  Also people
      who have MUD accounts but not accounts on the server box can
      use the DGD editor and get access only to the files they're
      supposed to.</p>

    <p>You can use the <b>access</b> command on a wizard's name to find
      out his access.  You can use it with no argument to find out
      <i>your</i> access.
      With the special string &quot;global&quot; you can find out what
      areas allow everybody read access.  You can use it on a file to
      find out who has what access to it. </p>

    <p><b>grant</b></p>

    <p><b>ungrant</b></p>

    <p>The <b>quota</b> command lists a wizard's resource usage.  With
      no arguments it gives the usages for the user that typed it.  With
      one argument it gives the usages for the wizard whose name is given.
      With two arguments it takes a wizard's name and a resource type
      (such as ticks, stack, callouts, etc) to give the usage for.  With
      three arguments of the form &quot;quota &lt;user&gt; &lt;rsrc&gt;
      &lt;limit&gt;&quot; it will try to set that user's limit on that
      resource to the number specified if you've got the necessary
      privilege to do that.  For most limits, -1 means infinite.
    </p>

    <p>The <b>rsrc</b> command typed by itself will show the MUD's total
      usage of the same resources <b>quota</b> affects.  This doesn't just
      show your usage.  It shows everybody's.
      With a resource name
      and a numerical limit <b>rsrc</b> will set the new limit to the
      given value.  With just a resource name <b>rsrc</b>
      will list the usage of that resource by all wizards. </p>

    <p>The <b>people</b> command is just a slightly beefier <b>users</b>
      command.
      It displays IP addresses of those logged in.</p>
    <p>The <b>status</b> command shows a little summary of driver status.
      Try it out and see!  You can also use it with an argument to get the
      status of an object.  Try some object names and some values from the
      history list. </p>

    <p>The <b>swapout</b> command will attempt to swap out all objects.
      This could be useful for testing, prior to a statedump, or when
      the MUD's RAM footprint is objectionably large and not many users
      are logged in. </p>

    <p>The <b>statedump</b> command will write out a dump of the MUD's
      current state which could be good for bootstrapping the MUD later,
      backing up in case of crashes, or duplicating the MUD and running
      another copy.</p>

    <p>The <b>shutdown</b> command attempts to shut down the MUD. </p>

    <p>The <b>reboot</b> command attempts to reboot the MUD. </p>

    <hr></hr>
    <p> If you try many commands incorrectly they will give you usage
      information.  This may or may not tell you more about what the command
      does, but it'll at least tell you how you can try to find out! </p>

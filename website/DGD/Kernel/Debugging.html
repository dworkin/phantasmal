    <h1> Debugging and the Kernel MUDLib </h1>

    <h2> Tracking Down Weird Issues </h2>

    <p> Absolutely the first thing you'll find yourself doing once
      you start hacking together your MUDLib is seeing errors and
      wondering where they're coming from.  This little guide will
      help you on your first faltering steps at tracking these things
      down.  It's far from complete or comprehensive, but every
      little bit helps.  There's a saying about documentation
      being like sex which I'll omit for the moral betterment of the
      under-14 crowd. </p>

    <p> You'll want a stack crawl before you get anything else.  Often
      that'll be enough.  Once you've got the stack crawl and found
      the line it's on, the line may be simple or complex, but there
      are the usual problems and the usual attempts to fix them. </p>

      <ul>
	<li> Divide the line up into more operations </li>
	<li> Do some of the things on the line on a prior line to see
	  if they break </li>
	<li> Add a harmless line before the line to see if it's actually
	  a previous bug, not on the line you see the complaint for </li>
	<li> Try some alternate ways to do the same operation </li>
	<li> Pray </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      You know the drill.
    </p>

    <p> So what if your stack crawl does work so well?  You may have
      the problem down to a single operation &mdash; say a
      compile_object &mdash; and it's failing.  Why?  There are a
      number of resources you can try.  If it's a driver or auto
      operation, you can look it up <a href="Auto_API.html">here</a>
      for possible helpful hints.  If not, you can grep through the
      Kernel MUDLib sources or even the DGD sources for hints.  You
      can also ask the mailing list, naturally, though we recommend
      you try all other likely choices first. </p>

    <p> What if you get a stack crawl but it leads to an ugly dead
      end?  One common one is that you get to a DGD built-in operation
      like ::compile_object() in the driver or AUTO object.  In that
      case, grep through .../dgd/src/comp/*.c for the error message.
      It works for me quite often.  It's not always quite clear what
      the problem is though... </p>

    <p> Or what if you hit a try/catch statement?  There are several
      in the AUTO and driver objects.  I recommend editing them
      to remove the try/catch, at least for debugging purposes.  This
      works especially well if you have a source control system
      like <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com">BitKeeper</a> in place.
      You can edit the AUTO or driver object, play with it, debug
      some more, and revert the changes when you feel like it.
      The BitKeeper plug is just gratuitous &mdash; I really like their
      software, but I don't work for them.  Anyway. </p>

    <p> To conclude, I'm going to give a list of some especially
      irritating or cryptic messages I've encountered and what they
      actually mean.  As time progresses, I expect that more and
      more pretty innocuous ones will sneak in along with the
      irritating ones, slowly growing more comprehensive.  Feel
      free to submit your own, to the mailing list or to me
      personally! </p>

    <h2> Error Messages I Have Known And Loved (ERMIHKAL) </h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Cannot inherit XXX</dt>
      <dd>This could conceivably mean an error in the DGD driver, but
	usually it means that the driver inherit_program function
	has returned the dreaded nil.  Why might it do that?  Common
	reasons include inheriting something without /lib/ in the
	name, inheriting a /kernel object without being under
	/usr/System, not having read access to the object you're
	trying to inherit, or your objectd's forbid_inherit
	returning true on the offending file. </dd>

      <dt>Cannot clone XXX</dt>
      <dd> See <a href="Auto_API.html">this</a> under clone_object. </dd>

<h2>Threading and Long-Duration Functions</h2>

<p>You probably already know that DGD is a disk-based MUD, which means
that it'll almost always keep your stuff swapped out when not in use. It
also means that in general you can't iterate through every object since
that would drag more objects into RAM than you have RAM -- a definite
no-no.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Nothing's wrong with that. But how does the ObjectD do
its thing? Doesn't it need to go through every object in order to
recompile the AUTO object?</p>

<p>It does. And for larger MUDs, you can solve the problem above
<i>and</i> the problem of long operations that take more ticks than can
fit in a single thread in a single, pretty simple way. If you already
know about call_outs, then you already know the basic building block of
the approach.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you split the operation into a series of
steps, rather as if you were putting it into a loop. The important thing
about the steps is that they take less than a single thread's worth of
ticks, and touch far less than every object in memory -- at least,
individually. All together they can do anything you want. Remember, DGD
will swap objects in when you use them and will swap them out when it
runs out of space -- but only at the end of a thread. You're going to
put each of these steps you divide your function into in its own thread
using call_out.</p>

<p>In fact, you can put it into multiple helper functions. For security
you'll want to make them static. For call_out to work, you <i>can't</i>
make them private, so don't (AUTO has to call them, at least in the
kernel MUDLib). For many functions, that's basically enough and it'll
all work fine. But it's still not quite the same as doing it all in one
go.</p>

<p>The biggest missing component is that if you just do your function in
a series of call_outs, you can be interrupted <i>halfway through</i>.
Even if you set the call_out delay to zero, which you'll want to,
somebody else can still call your object when you're only halfway done.
For simple objects you'll just need to grin and bear it -- make sure
your object can deal with these calls.</p>

<p>But for big, vital, mission-critical components that's just not
acceptable. For an objectd, for instance, you don't want to have your
MUD keep churning while only <i>half the objects are upgraded</i>.
That's just inviting disaster, and it certainly makes for a very
unpredictable system. So instead, you need a way to lock down the rest
of the system and keep it from running.</p>

<p>The Kernel MUDLib's rsrcd gives you most of what you need through the
suspend_system call, which you (naturally) must be privileged System
code to use (in the ~System directory, usually). You can reverse it with
release_system() when you're done, or in <i>any error case</i> -- you
don't want to leave the system suspended if you only get halfway done.
Incidentally, check the return value from call_out. If it returns a
number less than one, that means an error of some kind occurred and your
new call_out isn't scheduled. Be sure to release the system's call_outs
in that case too.</p>

<p>That's fine (you can see <a href="../external/geir_objectd.c">Geir
Harald Hansen's objectd</a> for a great example of how all of this
works, by the way), but it doesn't fully solve the problem. You need to
keep any new threads from starting until you're done. That means
stopping other people's call_outs as described above. But it also means
keeping new connections from happening or old connections from getting
new input. And for that, you'll need to do the work.</p>

<p>The work, in this case, consists of messing with the telnetd and the
user objects. TelnetD can turn away connections with an error message --
just return -1 when querying the delay and the connection will close
immediately. Remember, you don't want to do anything complicated because
this code can run when your MUD is only half-recompiled!</p>

<p>For user objects, you'll probably want to send a message to each
connection <i>before</i> suspending the system and then have them all
ignore all input while it's suspended. You can query userd for a list of
all open connections. See why you usually just want to let it be
possible to call your object when you're halfway done? However, for
major things like recompiling the AUTO object there's just no other good
way to do it. You can recompile by the seat of your pants (as Phantasmal
does as of this writing, April 8th, 2002), but at some point it'll come
back and bite you.</p>

<p>Since suspending all these things (call_outs through rsrcd,
connections through telnetd, input through the user objects) is kind of
a pain and involves touching a lot of objects, you might be tempted to
write a simple library function to do it. Bear in mind that when you
suspend call_outs through rsrcd, it uses previous_object() to check its
caller and suspends call_outs for <i>everyone but that caller</i>. That
means that the library you put the call in can register call_outs, but
you, who called it, cannot. That almost always means your call_outs
won't happen and neither will anybody else's. The library probably
registers no call_outs of its own. The other work (telnetd, user
objects) can be put into a library safely if you write the code
reasonably.</p>

<p>There's not yet useful code for all of this in this article. I hope
to remedy that in the future. In the mean time, <i>do</i> look at
<a href="../external/geir_objectd.c">Geir Harald Hansen's objectd</a>
for an excellent demonstration of many of the principles involved.</p>

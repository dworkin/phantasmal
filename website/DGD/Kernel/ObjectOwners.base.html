<h1>Object Creators and Owners</h1>

<h3>What is an Object's Creator?</h3>

<p>Finding an object's creator is easy. The object's name will
usually start with /usr/XXX. That XXX is the object's creator as
far as the Kernel MUDLib is concerned.</p>

<h3>Who Owns the Object?</h3>

<p>The Kernel MUDLib occasionally does things with objects
according to who owns them. The owner is, conceptually, the user
who called clone_object() or the equivalent. But it's a little
trickier than that.</p>

<p>Say you've just entered a command which causes an object to be
cloned. You're the current user, but you're using code in (for
instance) /usr/System to run the command. So who owns the new
object, you or System?</p>

<p>Say it's not a clone? Does that make a difference? Yup. If an
object isn't a clone then the creator is also the owner. For
instance, that's true if it's the original compiled clonable
object, or if it's a library.</p>

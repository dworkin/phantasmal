    <h1> Object Creators and Owners </h1>

    <h3> What is an Object's Creator? </h3>

    <p> Finding an object's creator is easy.  The object's name will
      usually start with /usr/XXX.  That XXX is the object's creator
      as far as the Kernel MUDLib is concerned. </p>

    <h3> Who Owns the Object? </h3>

    <p> The Kernel MUDLib occasionally does things with objects
      according to who owns them.  The owner is, conceptually, the user
      who called clone_object() or the equivalent.  But it's a little
      trickier than that. </p>

    <p> Say you've just entered a command which causes an object to be
      cloned.  You're the current user, but you're using code in
      (for instance) /usr/System to run the command.  So who owns the
      new object, you or System?  </p>

    <p> Say it's not a clone?  Does that make a difference?  Yup.  If
      an object isn't a clone then the creator is also the owner.  For
      instance, that's true if it's the original compiled clonable
      object, or if it's a library. </p>

You can easily scan through auto.c for all instances of owner and 
creator being assigned anything. It all happens in _F_create and the 
logic is quite straight-forward:

   * The creator is purely a function of the object's name...
     * An object /usr/Foo/* has creator Foo
     * An object /kernel/* has creator System
       * (i.e. /kernel and /usr/System have some equivalences)
     * Anything else has creator nil

   * The owner is identical to the creator for master objects (anything 
that is neither clone nor pure program). For clones it is set to the 
owner of the cloning object, unless the second argument to 
clone_object() and new_object() is used by the mudlib layer to force a 
certain owner for an object. This is how a wiztool that lives in /kernel 
can give a newly cloned object e.g. the owner 'zell'.

The clone_object() and new_object() functions pass on this 'uid to be' 
through a TLS value (thread local storage).

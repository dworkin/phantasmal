<h1>Object Creators and Owners</h1>

<h3>What is an Object's Creator?</h3>

<p>Finding an object's creator is easy. The object's name will usually
start with /usr/XXX. That XXX is the object's creator as far as the
Kernel MUDLib is concerned.</p>

<h3>Who Owns the Object?</h3>

<p>The Kernel MUDLib occasionally does things with objects according to
who owns them. The owner is, conceptually, the user who called
clone_object() or the equivalent. But it's a little trickier than
that.</p>

<p>Say you've just entered a command which causes an object to be
cloned. You're the current user, but you're using code in (for instance)
/usr/System to run the command. So who owns the new object, you or
System?</p>

<p>Say it's not a clone? Does that make a difference? Yup. If an object
isn't a clone then the creator is also the owner. For instance, that's
true if it's the original compiled clonable object, or if it's a
library.</p>

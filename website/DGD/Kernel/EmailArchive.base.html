The continuing confusion about get_dir() is probably an argument in
favour of of putting a file_info() function in the kernel lib's auto
object, returning get_dir() info for a single file, with wildcards
properly avoided.

Subject: [DGD] More info on expand()

Had another look at expand() and managed to clean my code up quite 
considerably.
This may come in handy for someone, somewhere, so I thought I'd leave it 
here in case anyone else has a similar problem.

In:
Path to filename from current directory, or just filename if it's in 
current directory.
Eg System/initd.c if in ~/. initd.c if in ~/System.

Out:
Nil if a directory/file doesn't exist/access denied/wildcards used.
Full path to file if not a directory/exists/access allowed/single filename.

/*
  * NAME:	single_file_path()
  * DATE:	18/12/01, Shevek.
  * DESCRIPTION:	Returns the full path to an existing file, nil if there is 
an error
  */
static string single_file_path(string str){
	    mixed *info;
		info = expand(str, 1, TRUE);
		if (info[4] == 1) {
			if (sizeof(info[0]) != 1) {
				return nil;
			}
			if (info[1][0]==-2){
				message(str + ": Is a directory.\n");
				return nil;
			}
     	}	
		else {
			message("Error: Use single filenames only.\n");
			return nil;
     	}
		str = info[0][0];
	return str;
}

Requires:
message() : return message to user.
expand() from /kernel/lib/wiztool plus whatever expand needs.

Hope that helps someone out.

Cheers,

Set the timeout in telnetd or binaryd (Or whatever you pass via initd.c) to 
-1, effectively this disconnects as soon as they connect. No need to pass 
any object back as it's never used.
It's good to be nice about it and leave query_banner giving some 
explanation as to why they can't logon on the telnet/binary port.

Eg
object select(string str) {
         /* No need to return anything, but you need the function I think */
}

int query_timeout(object connection){
         /* Disconnect immediately */
         return(-1);
}

string query_banner(object connection) {
         /* Needed, it gets called before query_timeout */
         string str;
         str="\nTelnet connections are not permitted.";
         str+="\nUse port 6048 \n";
         return(str);

An entire string will always make it on the first call, but possibly
not on the second one, because DGD's internal buffer is only one
string large (and strings have a maximum length).

No.  If you'll think about it, you'll see that the send_message call from
message_done() is always the &lt;first&gt; call -- the first one in the current

This is all excellent advice. The 'immerse self by doing' approach is 
easily the best one for DGD. It wouldn't hurt to have a FAQ somewhere 
explaining some of the things you discover and wonder about in the 
process of writing your first auto/driver objects, but this list is a 
pretty good resource for that, too.

The kernel mudlib takes a pretty powerful investment of time to really 
comprehend. It may not be the ideal start for somebody approaching DGD 
for the first time. Understanding the kernel library -does- give you an 
understanding of DGD, of course, but it's rather overkill and one could 
argue that DGD's main strength is its ability to be so powerful while 
avoiding directing the developer in any one given direction. The kernel 
library does direct you somewhat and you may lose some freedom of 
thought if you immerse yourself in the kernel library immediately.

Writing a driver/auto object first yourself may be a better idea, yes.

No, the 4th value is copied straight from dir[3].  It's the 5th value that
is set in case of an error, and also by the last line of the code you
quote.

It's calling get_dir() as a function in the auto object, not as a kfun.

You would benefit greatly from increased use of capitalization.

I think you want

	filename = DIR + "/" + str[0 .. 0] + "/" + str + ".pwd";

An alternative might be to add ~System/include to the includes list in the DGD
config file?  Potentially before others if you intend on possibly overriding
anything that gets defined in the kernel lib.

Try including it from, say, ~admin/foobar.c, and you will find that
the ~/include/ directory is assumed to be ~admin/include/, not
~System/include/.

The /kernel/include/ directory would only be a problem if
/kernel/include were part of the search-path, which it isn't, adding
it is what I would consider an interface-change and all bets are off
at that point. :-)

I understand your point about the encapsulation, if I were to further
develop this particular demo-System-lib I might change things a bit.

The kernel lib's user object is <meant> to be replaced, but the

Replacing is not modifying :)  The kernel library allows you to replace
the user object, by creating a telnet connection manager or binary
connection manager.  I have detailed how to do this in a recent posting,
in response to a question of your own I believe.

In my opinion Dworkin's great strength is he masters the full spectrum,
from tinkering in near-optimal assembly code to intuiting architectural
designs, and through this mastery is the slave of neither extreme. This
results in code and design that is a very unusual mix of flexible and
generic on one hand, and finalized and settled on the other.

I think ~System is one of these cases. For the kernel library to fully
stand alone, it is appropriate for it to perform one well-defined call,
placing the onus of integration entirely in the hands of the integrator.

Modifying an include file in /kernel has a very different feel; it has
the effect of 'pointing' the kernel library at your code. Sometimes, for
some designs, that is a useful thing: e.g. DGD itself works that way.

But for the kernel library it it inappropriate. The self-containedness
of the kernel library is the main reason it is interesting to me. When
every piece of code I ever wrote has crashed, I can still log into the
emergency admin port and fix the problem using code that I know has not
been touched through my frenzied development. It's a great boundary to
have -- to be able to rely on: no files go in /kernel. period.

If you really wanted to change System to something else, the place for
it would probably be in /include/config.h, but I advice against that.

All right, I was being too minimalist here.  You also need a telnet
connection manager and a user object in /usr/System.

So, what should be in which directory?  Objects outside of /kernel and
/usr cannot do file operations or create objects, so I would suggest
something like the following:

/sys		contains stateless "daemon" objects
/lib		contains inheritables that are useful to all wizards
/obj		contains clonables that are useful to all wizards
/usr/Melville	contains the first few rooms of the mudlib; rooms must
		be able to create other objects such as monsters, and
		therefore should be inside /usr.

Alternatively, you could directories such as create /melville/sys,
/melville/lib, etc.

You may find a need for other objects in /usr/System, but you should
only put objects in there if such a need exists.  Any object in
/usr/System can write anywhere except in /kernel, can create objects
that are owned by any other user, and can destruct any object that
is not in /kernel.  The more objects you have in /usr/System, the
more objects you have to check for possible security holes.

Some examples:

 *) The kfun this_user() returns nil in a callout. At times, one would
    want this value preserved across callouts, since it's usually well-
    defined at the time the callout is started. The Skotos library now
    does this, and it uses a TLS slot to store the preserved value for
    the duration of the thread.

 *) If DGD did not count ticks itself, we could provide a rudimentary
    execution-time limiter by updating a TLS slot whenever we did some
    big operation (or the cheesy version: store time() at the start of
    the thread and occasionally compare it to time() so that threads
    on average freeze the process for no more than 0.5 seconds).

 *) You could designate a TLS slot as 'debug data', perhaps putting a
    mapping value there or maybe an array of mappings or whatnot; and
    as the thread weaves its way through the code of your library,
    debug functions could place interesting data there which gets
    stored or logged or somesuch at the end of the thread, perhaps
    under certain conditions...

Of course, DGD does not yet have multi-processing, but this is one of
the many preliminary architectural features that Dworkin has put there
in preparation. Also, it's just tidy to keep stuff that is relevant in
the context of a thread private to that thread.

Yes.  Reason being that this way it is possible to (a) take over from
another connection and re-establish your relation to the same player-
object with a new user-clone, and (b) in a persistent game you don't
want to have to destroy your player-object when you need to forcibly
close the connection.

Most likely you've defined the function as 'void close() { ... }'
while it should be 'void close(int forced) { ... }'.

I can't imagine that being the way things work, what version of DGD
are you running, on what platform, and what mud-client are you using?

> If I have no close command then it's fine ... *confused*

I think you mean function, not command.  Calling an undefined function
in an object will work no matter what parameters you tried to call it
with, but if the function exists and you're running with type-checking
mode 2 (I think) then it had better match with the parameters of the
function.

It might help to do the disconnecting/destructing from a call_out() so
that the network-traffic is given a bit more time to be sent across.

You want rlimits() restrictions surrounding anything that doesn't have
a damn good reason for being allowed to finish 'no matter what'.

In general that means you override the standard call_out() so that the
function gets called with some rlimits() restriction, and similar bits
for open()/close()/receive_message()/etc functions, in short anything
that can start a new thread.

> Also security ... So far we don't really have any security checks on

Panic. ;-)  There are three levels of security as I see it:

1. Internal consistency, to make sure certain auto-object functions
   are only used by other auto-object code, for instance.

   For that type of situation previous_program() is really useful.

2. Filesystem security.  Do you want anyone or anything to be able to
   read/write to/from anywhere?

   To fix that you'll want to sit down and think about what the basic
   rules are, and how flexible you want to be in being able to 'grant'
   access to others, etc.  Overruling the basic file/directory-
   related kfuns is the next step once you've figured that out.

3. Cloning/compiling/destructing/inheriting/including.  Be careful who
   or what is allowed to use what other objects/files for this.

Good luck!

Erwin.

The urge to make ~System as small as possible hit me later than I
would have wished, and I spent a lot of extra time moving things
out of ~System and into other directories. ~System should do almost
nothing but export the priviliges given to it by the kernel library
to the rest of the library, along with whatever restrictions you
want to add to the kernel library's.

In truth, probably not, for two reasons. First, the kernel mudlib
is, if you build over it correctly, highly transparent to the
end goals. In terms of functionality, the kernel strikes me as
extremely flexible (though I'm not very familiar with it) and
I doubt it misses any features I would consider important. In
terms of elegance, that might not be true - the kernel has
features that I personally don't anticipate that I'd ever use,
and if I built something for myself from scratch, I could get
something that did less than the present kernel does, but did
everything I wanted, in less space (but much more programmer
time, of course).

Second, Melville was always oriented towards being a real simple
mudlib that would be familiar to someone who coded on MudOS or
other post-LP-2.4.5 drivers, but would let you start to get
into the internals of how DGD worked. In 1994 I think it did
a decent job of that. Nowadays the driver has moved so far
beyond Melville that it doesn't anymore. Today it's main
purpose is to give a familiar mudlib to someone who wants to
code more or less the same way they did in 1994 (which is
perhaps a dumb goal - why use DGD if you're not going to take
advantage of its power? - but the evidence shows that there
is a small but reliable market for it.) Both of those goals
could be carried out equally well in a mudlib that ran over
the kernel, and the "intro to DGD" one could, of course, be
carried out much better that way. Today I would guess that
Phantasmal, which does run over the kernel, is the right way
to go for someone relatively inexperienced in game design who
is interested in learning how to hack DGD. (Disclaimer: I know
Phantasmal only from discussion on this group, I may be totally
wrong about that.)

What you can't do is set a tick limit and then raise it.  Non-negative
tick limits can only be set when the current limit is -1 (infinite).
Once a limit is set, you are committed.  You can voluntarily lower it,
though.

>From your description, I think you should be setting the limit to
250,000 from where the current limit is infinite.  That'll allow you
to run the consecutive time-limited operations, as you describe.

You don't have to, as long as you go back to unlimited ticks first:

    rlimits (-1; 0) {
	rlimits (250000; 0) {
	    task1();
	}
	rlimits (250000; 0) {
	    task2();
	}
	/* ... */
    }

Or, even better:

    rlimits (-1; 0) {
	call_limited("task1");
	call_limited("task2");
	/* ... */
    }

Static functions can be called with call_limited().  Beyond that,
it is not clear to me exactly what you are trying to do, so it is
hard to offer advice.

It disallows raising the ticks limit, unless you are in "supervisor"
mode, i.e. running with no ticks limit.  Note that you cannot deal
with running out of ticks unless you do the dealing in code that has
no ticks limit (unless you make the whole operation atomic).

System objects are subject to the same restrictions on raising ticks
as other objects, to avoid accidents where the ticks limit is raised
forever in an infinite loop.

Learning to 'hack' DGD is most definitely not my only goal.  The one biggest
issue that I have with the kernel library is lack of documentation.  At
first glance I thought you would simply hack it to expand it.  Then when I
read stuff at Phantasmal's site (which is wonderful, I might add) it turns
out it looks in some directory in the user directory for extensions of these
objects that you can apparently drop in place yourself...

At least in this case, I would expect that there are more than enough 
of us who understand that even writing good grammars to feed a generic 
parser are hard to write, and that there are good, dedicated texts on 
the matter, that it wouldn't be hard to explain it to anyone who didn't 
just understand.

As for the rest, I've often found situations where I would have to read 
the documentation _and_ the kernel mudlib's implementation of that 
section in order to really understand either.  This tends to be a 
two-edged sword, as it gives deeper insight as to why things are the 
way they are, but there are times when I just want to implement a 
feature without having a history lesson first.  8)

If you want to re-do Melville on top of the kernel library, you have to
move files around.  That is a given.

As much as I like the kernel library, I'd like to see other mudlibs that
don't depend on it as well.  When everyone uses the kernel library, it
becomes harder for me to find bugs in DGD that the kernel library just
doesn't trigger.

Here is what the kernel library does, and what a modern mudlib should do:

 - Provide a layer of abstraction between the driver and the higher-level
   mudlib, so that the latter does not have to be aware of driver changes
   (other than changes in LPC itself).
 - A framework for persistence.  In DGD this is really simple, all you
   have to do is destroy all connection objects to let them "go linkdead",
   and to let objects that deal with absolute time know that there has
   been a reboot interval.  For example, a cron object which wants to
   run tasks at specific hours should reschedule its callouts after a
   reboot.
 - Separation of inheritables and other objects.  This is essential for
   any mud that wants to be able to entire inheritance trees of objects
   to the latest source version without destroying object state.  The
   kernel library does it through pathnames, but other methods are
   possible.
 - Separation through pathnames of clones and LWOs.  This is not
   essential, and the kernel library just does it for the sake of
   orthogonality.
 - Resource management and measurement.  This is absolutely essential for
   a persistent mud with guest programmers (think of LambdaMOO), and
   useful but not required in other cases.
 - File security and object security.  A requirement for muds with guest
   programmers, but hard to do right, and the kernel library's system
   may be too paranoid.
 - DGD/MP aware.  This is going to be important in the future.  A number
   of design issues are involved:

    - There have to be some kind of thread-local variables which are not
      held in any object, to handle things such as this_player().
    - It must be possible to start a callout without making a change to
      data in any object (this is why callouts are no longer a resource
      in the kernel library, since resources are tracked by a central
      object).
    - Large threads that modify many objects should, whenever possible,
      be broken up into smaller threads modifying fewer objects, using
      callouts.

Who are you asking?  You changed it, it's your own mudlib now :)  If
you don't want callouts in /k objects to be invisible, make them
visible.  They are not visible in the kernel library because /kernel
objects are in a class of themselves, and should definitely <not> mix
with other objects.

You will have to do some conversion, though, since callouts in
kernel objects have a different argument format; they don't pass
through the _F_callout wrapper.

At first I didn't think that helped, but did some grep'ing and found that the
only kernel objects that do call_out's are rsrc.c and rsrcd.c, and they're
the only objects prevented from using the _F_callout wrapper:
due to (in auto.c's call_out) :
    if ( DIR_RSRC(oname) ) {
    /* direct callouts for resource management objects */
    return ::call_out(function, delay, args...);
    }

where, #define DIR_RSRC(f) sscanf(f, "/k/%*s/rsrc") != 0

So I don't have to prevent status() from displaying call_out's in all objects
that are/could be/ considered "Kernel" just 'DIR_RSRC' ones.

So...security here I come :), Thank ye.

All callouts are redirected to _F_callout() in the auto object.  This
calls _F_call_limited(), and that function then <replaces> the argument
array with the TLS array.  I could have handled this through another
function (say __F_callout) as it is done elsewhere, but _F_call_limited
is heavily involved in TLS manipulation anyhow.

By the way, the kernel library uses the _F_/_Q_ convention for functions
that have to be present in objects, but should not pollute the object
namespace.  If "_F_destruct" had been "destruct", then mudlibs based
on the kernel library could not have defined a destruct function
themselves (these _F_/_Q_ functions are not intended to be masked).

When working on the kernel library, for a long time I had the idea
in mind that the wiztool should be inheritable by everyone.  It didn't
work out with the kernel library's security system, though.  So the
wiztool should be in /usr/System.  It's still a good idea to let people
write their own extensions for it, but those can't be added through
inheritance.

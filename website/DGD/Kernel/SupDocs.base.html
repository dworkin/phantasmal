    <h3> DGD Documentation </h3>

    <p> Of course, you've already read the DGD documentation which
      comes in &quot;dgd/doc&quot; (<i>haven't</i> you?), but just in
      case I'll do a little overview. </p>

      <ul>
	<li>Commercial: this file tells you about using DGD
	  commercially.  This is important only if you ever plan to make
	  money off a DGD MUD.  While it's involved and requires
	  licensing, making money off any *other* flavor of LPMUD is
	  forbidden entirely by the license, so this is more generous of
	  Dworkin than you think.</li>

	<li>Extensions: this tells you how to modify DGD itself in
	  some specific, pretty clean ways.  Don't do this until you
	  have a pretty good grasp of everything you'll need for a
	  MUDLib.  Even then, you'll want to be on the mailing list
	  since this stuff isn't guaranteed to work right and operates
	  very differently than you might think.</li>

	<li>Introduction: an excellent introduction to the interface
	  between DGD and the Kernel MUDLib.  You won't interact with
	  this stuff directly, but it's good to know.  Also, the Kernel
	  tends to pass this interface on in a slightly-modified way, so
	  knowing the original is helpful.  This is an excellent
	  programmer's introduction to what a driver and an auto object
	  are, and how DGD uses them.</li>

	<li>Platforms: getting DGD compiled in the first place.
	  You've already done that, right?</li>

	<li>editor: help on using DGD's built-in editor.  You'll
	  eventually want a better editor, but not necessarily in DGD or
	  your MUDLib.  In general, getting your editor entirely on the
	  client side is best, building it into your MUDLib is
	  next-best, and building it directly into DGD is worst.  Feel
	  free to ask Dworkin about this on the newsgroup, or just read
	  through the archives and discover his opinions for yourself.</li>

	<li>parser: help on using DGD's built in parse_string
	  facility.  It's neat, it'll do good things, but it's not (yet)
	  relevant to your MUDLib.  It will let you build fine features
	  later, but first you'll need to get stuff up and running.</li>

	<li>The kfun directory: up-to-date documentation on DGD's
	  interface (through the auto object) to your program.  This is
	  roughly the same as documentation on OS system calls, and in
	  the same way as system calls, your standard library (the
	  Kernel MUDLib) can override them.  If you try to use a kfun
	  and it doesn't work right, check the Kernel MUDLib's auto
	  object and see if it overrides it.</li>
      </ul>

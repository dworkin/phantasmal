<h2>Additional and Non-Standard AUTO Objects</h2>

<p><i>Klib inheritance and inclusion mechanism changed, this stuff
is out of date now.</i></p>

<p>The Kernel Library has a much-misunderstood feature that allows
you to change the effective AUTO object of programs. This document
describes how to do it.</p>

<p>In this case, "changing the effective AUTO object" just means
having objects implicitly inherit (as with AUTO) from another
object. Note that the object being implicitly inherited from, like
all objects, will inherit from the AUTO object itself. Obviously,
there are some possible problems with cyclic inheritance if you
aren't careful here.</p>

<p>First off, you'll need an object manager. Your object manager
doesn't have to do anything fancy. It doesn't have to track
objects, or respond in any complicated way to any of the function
calls it receives. However, it <i>does</i> have to exist and be
registered with the Kernel Library via
DRIVER-&gt;set_object_manager(). See
&frasl;doc&frasl;kernel&frasl;hook&frasl;driver for details about
what functions your object manager needs to define.</p>

<p>Add the line <tt>#include "AUTO"</tt> to the standard include
file, which is usually "&frasl;include&frasl;std.h". Create an
empty file, called AUTO, in the &frasl;include directory. This
makes sure that most objects will transparently, automatically
include the (empty) AUTO file, which will do nothing.</p>

<p>However, the objects you have specifically chosen to implicitly
include your alternate AUTO file are different. You're going to
make a file called something like
"&frasl;include&frasl;second_auto.h". That file contains only the
line <tt>inherit "&frasl;usr&frasl;Bob&frasl;myauto";</tt></p>

<p>The way you'll choose what objects will use your alternate AUTO
object is with your object manager, which will need to contain a
call to path_special. Your path_special call will return the
filename of your include file (such as
"&frasl;include&frasl;second_auto.h") when it sees the name of a
file that you want to have that second AUTO object.</p>

<p>Please note that your second AUTO object will inherit from the
regular first AUTO object, just like any other library. It'll need
to be a library (because other programs inherit from it). And make
sure it doesn't inherit from itself, and that no libraries it
inherits from also inherit from it.</p>

<p>Note that programs under &frasl;kernel can't inherit a second
AUTO object. You don't get to mess with them. Similarly, nothing
under &frasl;usr&frasl;System can get a second AUTO object. They
just get the regular one. If you really need objects under
&frasl;usr&frasl;System to inherit from your additional AUTO
object, you can have them inherit from it explicitly, with an
'inherit' statement, like usual.</p>

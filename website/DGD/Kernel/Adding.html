    <h2> Adding Stuff to your MUDLib </h2>

    <p> So you've got a good start on a MUDLib, either by
      <a href="Modifying.html">modifying the Kernel MUDLib</a> directly
      or with the help of <a href="../external/System.zip">Shevek's
	BBLib</a>.  You're rip-roaring to go and you've even been
      adding a few little extra features here and there.  Great!
      Welcome to the ever-expanding community of DGD MUDLib authors.
      We're happy to hear from you on the mailing list, we're happy
      you're out there, and we look forward to your contributions to
      the set of MUDLibs we can study and use! </p>

    <p> What can we do to help you?  Well, for starters we can suggest
      some things you should do to keep your MUDLib
      usable, featureful and secure -- and believe me, doing
      all that at once is <i>hard</i>!  The <b>Adding Stuff to your
	MUDLib</b> section on the previous page is here to help you
      figure out some things you should put in your MUDLib.
      It can't tell you everything.  The things that make your MUDLib
      different and special are the things we'd never think of
      because only <i>you</i> have the vision to make them happen.
      But we can help you fix some common problems and avoid some
      common pitfalls. </p>

    <h2> About &quot;Adding Stuff&quot; </h2>

    <p> In this series of documents we'll try to talk about security pretty
      regularly.  We tend to assume that you're going to have some
      not-really-trusted people running code.  That may be your users
      but more often it'll be admins or builders you've given access to
      so they can
      build areas.  They may or may not be fully trustworthy but even the
      best programmer can have a bad day now and again.  When that
      happens it's best if your MUDLib is robust enough to handle it.
      It can make sure that the worst they get is a nasty error message on
      their command line while the MUD chugs along with nary a hitch for
      the other users.  It's not really possible to make that happen
      <i>all</i> the time, especially with your highest-level admins,
      but we can keep you from tripping over the wrong thing quite a
      lot of the time if you're willing to code carefully.
      DGD is just that cool. </p>

    <p> That also means that if you're only going to give coding
      rights to people you absolutely trust and who would be allowed to
      bring your entire MUD crashing down around your ears and destroying
      all your data if they felt like it...  Well, then you can ignore
      pretty much all our security advisories.  Your MUDLib won't be the
      first to do so. </p>

  My approach to this was to make a DGD object which I called a 'heavy
array' that does something similar.  So rather than having a hardcoded
array of LWOs for tracking data, I have a collection object I add the
LWOs to.  Never did anything really useful with it (never needed to,
didn't have that many objects), but it would be very easy to make it
implement mapped arrays, as you have here.

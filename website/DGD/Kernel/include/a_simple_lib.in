  Possibly.  I've never had any performance problems
with it, but I'm also doing something that acts a lot
like a regular MUD.  Since a regular MUD uses an order
of magnitude less CPU than a modern desktop machine
provides (if that!), the small amount of waste that
the Kernel Library involves is simply not an issue.

  If you're going to do something that requires nearly
your entire CPU load, and you're going to do it in
tiny amounts at millisecond precision, then security
and sanity-checking both need to go.  They're too
expensive.  So you can write a less-secure and
less-debuggable version than the Kernel, which will be
faster.

  Of course, if you're doing something that
performance-intensive and precise, why are you using
LPC?

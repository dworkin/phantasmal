Pete-someone, I believe, and I just downloaded his code from your site, 
along with BBLib and some other stuff I'd been overlooking all the while.

That would probably be a good learning process, I mean, obviously 
changing some calls to the logger isnt going to be very taxing, but its 
a start, and as you point out further down, your manager's logging would 
come in handy at some point, more than likely.

If, or when? ;)

Thanks for the speedy reply, it occured to me that I was/am kind of 
jumping the gun on the ObjectD thing... I dont really need one while I'm 
constantly starting and stopping the driver and have very little code 
written.. the Kernel lib would probably handle most of what I need at 
this very early stage.  That said, it wouldnt hurt to have a working 
object manager plugged in, for when things get more complex, I'm sure.

Really I'm still trying to work out how I'm going to structure the lib, 
within the restrictions of the Kernel Lib, and I'll probably end up 
starting over once I get a proper feel for how everything works.  It's 
all too abstract until I start throwing code together.  :)

I know of three existing implementations of global upgrading, and
they're all substantially different.  Only two of them use the
kernel library.  I see room for more variants.

The kernel library doesn't include this because it is supposed to be
minimal.  It does provide all the hooks to make it possible, though --
see the object manager documentation in dgd/mud/doc/kernel/hook. I
estimate that it can be implemented in about a thousand lines of
code.

Compared to the time it took to do the global upgrade, a rollback
due to an error in atomically executed code will be almost
unnoticable.

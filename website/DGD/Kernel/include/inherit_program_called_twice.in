Yes, it's the normal way of things to happen in DGD, nothing to do with
your OS or hardware. :-)

DGD only fully compiles one object at a time.

If you compile object A which inherits object B which has to be compiled
first, it'll finish compiling object B and then start the compilation of
object A from the start.

If you add debug statements in the path_include() driver-function you'll
find it calls those functions again as well.

Hope this helps,

Erwin.

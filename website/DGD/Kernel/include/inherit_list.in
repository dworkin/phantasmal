That is precisely the thing to do. It's not a "mess" at all, it is
a very elegant solution, but it -is- a bit of an undertaking to get
all the kinks worked out.

Yes.

Probably, but DGD is still a minimalist design. If it can be done
quickly and well in LPC, why clutter up the driver?

It "reads" the source file, but it certainly modifies the object. :-)

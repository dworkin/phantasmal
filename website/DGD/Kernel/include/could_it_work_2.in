The kernel library is not particularly friendly, true, and I completely 
agree that it is good to learn why you need something before you start 
using it. To limit the amount of "oops" that happens, seriously consider 
my suggestion not to start off with a persistent Mud. Then over time as 
you run the Mud, take note of how often you need to cold-start it and 
consider what would happen if you couldn't do that, ever. That'll give 
you a first appreciation of what need the kernel library attempts to fill.

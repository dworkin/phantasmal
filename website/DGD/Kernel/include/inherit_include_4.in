  Any call to compile_object in the wiztool goes through the wiztool
compile_object function, regardless of whether it reflects user
input.  In this case, it does not.

  There isn't a System user who can log in.  Indeed, that is explicitly
forbidden.  However, in the create() function of the wiztool it compiles
the objects it may later wish to clone.  In my case, they are things like
/usr/common/obj/user_state.c.  When I include a call to compile_object on
that object in the creator function, the call to access() that occurs in
/kernel/lib/wiztool.c passes owner (System), path
(/usr/common/obj/user_state.c) and access (WRITE_ACCESS).  Therefore,
System winds up needing write access to that file to compile it in its
create function.

In the kernel library, objects don't have access outside their own
/usr/Foo directory, even though user Foo may have that access.  This
is intended to prevent security leaks such as the above; if objects
in /usr/World have write access in /usr/System, then effectively
objects in /usr/World can do anything at all.

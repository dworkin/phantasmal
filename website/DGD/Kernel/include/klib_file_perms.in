It's very simple.  Basically, the file access permissions are much like
in 2.4.5.  By default, wizards only have write access in their own
directory, and read access everywhere outside /usr except /kernel/data.
They may have additional access granted to them.  A wizard's objects
only have that wizard's default access, irrespective of granted permissions.
There are some special cases, such as global read access in /usr/anywiz/open,
but that is the general picture.

File permissions also have an effect on compilation and cloning.  You
can only compile an object if you have write access to the file.  You
can only clone (or inherit) an object if you have read access to it.

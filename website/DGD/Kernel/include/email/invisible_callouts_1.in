Who are you asking?  You changed it, it's your own mudlib now :)  If
you don't want callouts in /k objects to be invisible, make them
visible.  They are not visible in the kernel library because /kernel
objects are in a class of themselves, and should definitely <not> mix
with other objects.

You will have to do some conversion, though, since callouts in
kernel objects have a different argument format; they don't pass
through the _F_callout wrapper.

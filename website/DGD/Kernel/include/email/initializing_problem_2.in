Try including it from, say, ~admin/foobar.c, and you will find that
the ~/include/ directory is assumed to be ~admin/include/, not
~System/include/.

The /kernel/include/ directory would only be a problem if
/kernel/include were part of the search-path, which it isn't, adding
it is what I would consider an interface-change and all bets are off
at that point. :-)

I understand your point about the encapsulation, if I were to further
develop this particular demo-System-lib I might change things a bit.

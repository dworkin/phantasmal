Learning to 'hack' DGD is most definitely not my only goal.  The one biggest
issue that I have with the kernel library is lack of documentation.  At
first glance I thought you would simply hack it to expand it.  Then when I
read stuff at Phantasmal's site (which is wonderful, I might add) it turns
out it looks in some directory in the user directory for extensions of these
objects that you can apparently drop in place yourself...

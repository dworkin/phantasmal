When working on the kernel library, for a long time I had the idea
in mind that the wiztool should be inheritable by everyone.  It didn't
work out with the kernel library's security system, though.  So the
wiztool should be in /usr/System.  It's still a good idea to let people
write their own extensions for it, but those can't be added through
inheritance.

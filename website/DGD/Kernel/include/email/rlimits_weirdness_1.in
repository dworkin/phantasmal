What you can't do is set a tick limit and then raise it.  Non-negative
tick limits can only be set when the current limit is -1 (infinite).
Once a limit is set, you are committed.  You can voluntarily lower it,
though.

250,000 from where the current limit is infinite.  That'll allow you
to run the consecutive time-limited operations, as you describe.

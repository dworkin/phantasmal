At least in this case, I would expect that there are more than enough 
of us who understand that even writing good grammars to feed a generic 
parser are hard to write, and that there are good, dedicated texts on 
the matter, that it wouldn't be hard to explain it to anyone who didn't 
just understand.

As for the rest, I've often found situations where I would have to read 
the documentation _and_ the kernel mudlib's implementation of that 
section in order to really understand either.  This tends to be a 
two-edged sword, as it gives deeper insight as to why things are the 
way they are, but there are times when I just want to implement a 
feature without having a history lesson first.  8)

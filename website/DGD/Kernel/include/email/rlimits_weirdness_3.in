Static functions can be called with call_limited().  Beyond that,
it is not clear to me exactly what you are trying to do, so it is
hard to offer advice.

It disallows raising the ticks limit, unless you are in "supervisor"
mode, i.e. running with no ticks limit.  Note that you cannot deal
with running out of ticks unless you do the dealing in code that has
no ticks limit (unless you make the whole operation atomic).

System objects are subject to the same restrictions on raising ticks
as other objects, to avoid accidents where the ticks limit is raised
forever in an infinite loop.

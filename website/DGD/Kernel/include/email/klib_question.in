An entire string will always make it on the first call, but possibly
not on the second one, because DGD's internal buffer is only one
string large (and strings have a maximum length).

No.  If you'll think about it, you'll see that the send_message call from
message_done() is always the <first> call -- the first one in the current
thread.

Set the timeout in telnetd or binaryd (Or whatever you pass via initd.c) to 
-1, effectively this disconnects as soon as they connect. No need to pass 
any object back as it's never used.
It's good to be nice about it and leave query_banner giving some 
explanation as to why they can't logon on the telnet/binary port.

Eg
object select(string str) {
         /* No need to return anything, but you need the function I think */
}

int query_timeout(object connection){
         /* Disconnect immediately */
         return(-1);
}

string query_banner(object connection) {
         /* Needed, it gets called before query_timeout */
         string str;
         str="\nTelnet connections are not permitted.";
         str+="\nUse port 6048 \n";
         return(str);
}

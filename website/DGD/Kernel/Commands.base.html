@@TITLE Commands in the Kernel@@

<h2>User Commands in the Stock Kernel Library</h2>

<p>The Kernel MUDLib does very different things for regular users
and wizards (those that have special access such as admin). Let's
look at how it works for a regular user first.</p>

<p>A regular user is anybody that hasn't been specifically made a
wizard. The only exception is "admin". S/he is a wizard
automatically just because s/he's got that name. When a regular
user logs in they don't need a password. That's true only for the
stock, unmodified kernel MUDLib but so is everything else on this
page. Like everything else here it can be modified if you <a href=
"index.html">muddle with the MUDLib</a>.</p>

<p>The regular user can do a number of things. S/he can use the
<b>say</b> command to say stuff. For instance:</p>
<pre>
      say Hello, all!
</pre>

<p>S/he can use <b>emote</b> to do something similar. If s/he types
"emote jumps for joy!" and his/her name is Panda everybody will see
"Panda jumps for joy!". If you're impatient you can abbreviate
<b>say</b> with a single-quote and <b>emote</b> with a colon. Just
put either punctuation character at the front of a command line
right where you'd type <b>say</b> or <b>emote</b>.</p>

<p>To give a private message to somebody else you can <b>tell</b>
them something. For instance: "tell Panda I'm happy too!" will tell
Panda how thrilled you are.</p>

<p>To find out who's on the MUD you can type <b>users</b>. It'll
give you the list. Then you can tell them things with the other
commands.</p>

<p>You can set your password with the password command, typed by
itself, but that doesn't do anything useful unless you're a wizard.
If you are then you can do this. If you're not then you can still
set the password but it does nothing useful. You won't be asked for
it on login.</p>

<p>And you can quit. Good to know. You just type <b>quit</b>.</p>

<h2>Wizard/Administrator Commands</h2>

<p>The <b>code</b> command lets you execute a little snippet of
code and get the value back. DGD will automatically make a
temporary object for you in a temporary file that executes your
code. DGD even predeclares 26 one-letter lowercase variables of
type <b>mixed</b> for you to use in your code just in case you need
some temp vars.</p>

<p>You can type <b>history</b> by itself or followed by a number to
access the history of values your <b>code</b>, <b>compile</b> and
<b>clone</b> commands have been returning. You can access these
values in the arguments of many commands by referring to them as
$1, $2, $3, et cetera.</p>

<p>The <b>clear</b> command clears the command history.</p>

<p>The <b>compile</b> command recompiles an object. Some objects
won't like being recompiled - for instance if stuff inherits from
them. You give it the filename and it recompiles the file. You can
just give the filename without the path if you're in the correct
current directory. See <b>cd</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>pwd</b>, and so on
for how to tell if you're in the correct directory.</p>

<p>The <b>clone</b> command clones an object and puts it in the
command history for your enjoyment and edification. You can later
take the <b>status</b> or <b>destruct</b> it. Make sure to destruct
what you create!</p>

<p>The <b>destruct</b> command lets you destruct objects. Doing so
can be useful in your efforts to recompile inheritable (library)
objects. You're still better off with an object daemon doing it for
you, but <b>destruct</b> will also help you test <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><b>cd</b>, <b>pwd</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>cp</b>, <b>mv</b>,
<b>rm</b>, <b>mkdir</b>, <b>rmdir</b>: these are just like the
regular Unix shell commands of the same names. For DOS or Windows
guys: <b>ls</b> is <b>dir</b>. <b>cp</b> is <b>copy</b>. <b>mv</b>
is <b>move</b>. <b>rm</b> is <b>del</b>. <b>pwd</b> tells your
current directory. <b>mkdir</b> and <b>rmdir</b> are pretty much
the same as in DOS. <b>cd</b> is mostly the same, but typing just
<b>cd</b> by itself doesn't print the directory. Instead it changes
to your home directory. You can use all these commands from your OS
instead of inside the MUD, but sometimes it's more convenient to
have the command line right there.</p>

<p>The <b>ed</b> command lets you edit a file using DGD's built-in
editor. Docs on how to use it come with DGD. You can always just
use the editor on your machine if you prefer. However, Windows
users take note: the DGD editor is guaranteed to have the right
linebreak behavior and most Windows editors (like Visual Studio,
Visual C++ or Notepad) aren't. So the DGD built-in editor may be a
good alternative to grabbing TextPad.</p>

<p>If you're the admin, another advantage is that your MUD admins
can have MUD accounts, but not shell accounts on the server box.
They can use the DGD editor and get access only to the files
they're supposed to, and not your Unix command line nor other
people's files. That's a cheaper, simpler (and worse) alternative
to writing an FTP server into your MUD.</p>

<p>You can use the <b>access</b> command on a wizard's name to find
out what s/he can access. You can use it with no argument to find
out <i>your</i> access. With the special string "global" you can
find out what areas allow everybody read access. You can use it on
a file to find out who has what access to it.</p>

<p><b>grant</b></p>

<p><b>ungrant</b></p>

<p>The <b>quota</b> command lists a wizard's resource usage. With
no arguments it gives the usages for the user that typed it. With
one argument it gives the usages for the wizard whose name is
given. With two arguments it takes a wizard's name and a resource
type (such as ticks, stack, callouts, etc) to give the usage for.
With three arguments of the form "quota &lt;user&gt; &lt;rsrc&gt;
&lt;limit&gt;" it will try to set that user's limit on that
resource to the number specified if you've got the necessary
privilege to do that. For most limits, -1 means infinite.</p>

<p>The <b>rsrc</b> command typed by itself will show the MUD's
total usage of the same resources <b>quota</b> affects. This
doesn't just show your usage. It shows everybody's. With a resource
name and a numerical limit <b>rsrc</b> will set the new limit to
the given value. With just a resource name <b>rsrc</b> will list
the usage of that resource by all wizards.</p>

<p>The <b>people</b> command is just a slightly beefier
<b>users</b> command. It displays IP addresses of those logged
in.</p>

<p>The <b>status</b> command shows a little summary of driver
status. Try it out and see! You can also use it with an argument to
get the status of an object. Try some object names and some values
from the history list.</p>

<p>The <b>swapout</b> command will attempt to swap out all objects.
This could be useful for testing, prior to a statedump, or when the
MUD's RAM footprint is objectionably large and not many users are
logged in.</p>

<p>The <b>statedump</b> command will write out a dump of the MUD's
current state which could be good for bootstrapping the MUD later,
backing up in case of crashes, or duplicating the MUD and running
another copy.</p>

<p>The <b>shutdown</b> command attempts to shut down the MUD.</p>

<p>The <b>reboot</b> command attempts to reboot the MUD.</p>
<hr>

<p>If you try many commands incorrectly they will give you usage
information. This may or may not tell you more about what the
command does, but it'll at least tell you how you can try to find
out!</p>

    There's a lot in the mailing list archives about how to write an
    Object Manager.  Since you're better off adapting mine or Geir
    Harald Hansen's, I'm just going to collect general information for
    any other masochists who want to write their own.  That

Geir,

You're on the right track, and you're in luck. Thanks to the kernel
lib enforcing the total separation between inheritable and stateful
code, it's easier than it might be to write this kidn of automatic
upgrading system.

So, you want to upgrade /foo/lib/bar, which is inherited by a bunch
of other programs, possibly including some destructed ones that are
not yet freed (due to lingering dependencies). You can't recompile
it because it's inherited, so you have to destruct it.

To completely upgrade /foo/lib/bar, you need to observe the tree of
all programs that depend on it. All the interior nodes of this tree
are stateless inheritables, and so can be destructed as well. Next,
you step through all the leaf node objects -- clones, daemons, etc.

As you recompile them, one by one, you remove dependencies from the
old issue of /foo/lib/bar until finally the last recompile frees
the last dependency -- and the issue is freed.

Things to note: Unless you forbid destruction of a program that has
dependencies, you do have to use the ID's rather than just the path
names in the database. If such destruction is possible, there will
be more than one issue of the same program in memory at once (even
if only one is visible from the LPC layer), and you definitely need
to keep separate records for these issues!

Also, for a real-sized Mud, you need a datastructure that can hold
more than ARRAYSIZE dependencies. If you switch to using ID's, that
is probably solved most easily with an array of mappings, something
like issue = map[id>>8][id%0xFF].

One complex issue is how to deal with upgrading e.g the auto object
in a fully-grown Mud, where the swap file can be hugely larger than
the RAM in the machine. Recompiling the leaf objects in one single
thread becomes unworkable; DGD must be given the chance to swap out
now and then. This essentially requires basic support for freezing
all activity in the lib, explaining the kernel lib's support for
call_out suspension.

I know of three existing implementations of global upgrading, and
they're all substantially different.  Only two of them use the
kernel library.  I see room for more variants.

The kernel library doesn't include this because it is supposed to be
minimal.  It does provide all the hooks to make it possible, though --
see the object manager documentation in dgd/mud/doc/kernel/hook. I
estimate that it can be implemented in about a thousand lines of
code.


> (Fear the rollback of an atomic rebuild.)

Compared to the time it took to do the global upgrade, a rollback
due to an error in atomically executed code will be almost
unnoticable.

You can't.  You would have to do it all on one thread to make the
operation atomic.

You can block new connections by temporarily setting the login
timeout to -1.  You can block input on connections using
block_input() in /kernel/lib/connection.c.

You may not realize that with "upgrading" I mean something other
than "updating".  Global upgrading is the process of recompiling
a set of objects without destructing them first, allowing them
to retain state in the form of variables and callouts.  Of all
the LPC servers, only DGD has this capability.

However, it can only do so for one object (and all of its clones)
at a time, and only if the object is not inherited by another.
The division between inherited objects and other objects, enforced
by the kernel library, ensures that there always is a way to
upgrade any single object.  Global upgrading must coordinate
the process for a set of objects, usually all those that inherit
some specific object or objects.

It is arguably wrong for a cloneable object ever to have different
issues; after all, shouldn't all clones have the same behaviour?
Therefore I prefer simply to make destructing an object with clones
impossible.

There isn't any way to upgrade all existing objects in your scenario.
It is a special case of the more general problem:

    If an object is both inherited and used in any other way (either
    it has had a function called in it, or it has been cloned),
    upgrading both this object and those that inherit it is not
    possible.

This is precisely why I prevented using/cloning of inheritable objects
in the kernel library.

With the existing primitive operations (compiling an object, recompiling
an object, destructing an object), upgrading of all objects is not
possible in your scenario.

By the way, the subject is far from beaten to death.  I rather think
it died prematurely. :)

I looked long and hard at implementing everything in the server
back then, but eventually I decided to implement only minimal
upgrading support (recompiling a single object) because the
code would have been enormously complex at the server level.
It is fairly simple in LPC (about 1000 lines if you start with
the kernel library).  Given that this was completely new
functionality which nobody had ever asked for and which many
even failed to see a use for, I felt that it was not unreasonable
to put some restrictions on mudlibs that wanted to have it.

Another reason is that an LPC implementation -- as usual -- is
more flexible.  For example, suppose you upgrade the auto object
and everything that depends on it.  Recompiling every single
object in the mud in one go would cause an enormous amount of lag,
as well as consume a large amount of memory.  In LPC, the operation
can be broken into several pieces, with other tasks + regula
swapping in between.

It all depends on whether you like the separation between class
(inheritable) and object.  If you do, then anything that ignores
that difference is bad design.

Backward compatibility.  Also, not everyone appreciates the distinction
between class and object.

I understand that you'd rather have me implement it in the server
than do it yourself, but I hope that the above clarifies my reasons
for not having done so.

Whatever came of the idea, put forward on this list, to implement
global upgrades in LPC and make the code freely available?

Back to the original problem then.  The proposed scenario is

     A -i-> B -i-> C -c-> D
     A -i-> B -i-> C -i-> E -c-> F

The problem here is when D clones C.  The solution is an adaptation of a
solution I 'thought' I'd worked out a few days ago, until I realised my
memory of how it all worked was a little backwards ;)  Anyway, for ease
of explanation, we'll call C the primary master, a new object, CX,
called the secondary master and D will be the clone

Now, when a call is made to clone an object, the clone_object can create
the secondary master by creating a file that inherits the primary
master, and nothing else.  The name of this can be determined by some
algorithm so they can all be hidden from the user, thus making it all
transparent.  The clone D, can then be made of the secondary master,
leaving the primary master free to be inherited.

This will also fit right into Jason's original ideas on how to deal with
upgrading inherited objects.  Obviously, you would not hide these files
from the internal processes dealing with it all ;)

However, I'm not sure how to deal with the calling of functions in a
master.  I imagine we could overload call_other as I think the
{ob|file}->fn call uses call_other.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I think
someone with some more knowledge of how the function calling works needs
to finish this off ;)

Cheers,

Neil.

There's been a bit of talk about upgrading objects, and there's always
been people wanting code for it.  So...  This is how I'm doing upgrading
of objects.  Like Dworkin's kernel lib, I distinguish between classes
and objects.  Actually, I make a three-way distinction:

  1) libs: Anything with /lib/ in its path can be inherited.  It cannot
     be cloned.  No other objects can be inherited.  create() is not
     called, and the blueprint should not be used.
  2) clones: Anything with /obj/ in its path can be cloned.  No other
     objects can be cloned.  create() is called on the clones, but not
     the blueprint.  The blueprint should not be used.
  3) singles: All other objects have create() called on the blueprint.

2 and 3 together are called 'objects'.

If you're foolish enough to have *both* /lib/ and /obj/ in your path,
you're treated as a lib.

There is also mention of 'physical' objects.  These are clones that have
some 'real' existence in the MUD universe (including players).  Any
clone that wants a real existence inherits /kernel/lib/physical, which
defines (among many other things) the function is_physical() to simply
return 1.

The code below is NOT the best way of doing things.  In particular, I'm
not at all happy with the way that I'm including the auto object in the
inheritence table.  There's a bug in there somewhere too - it fails in
interesting ways if there was a compilation error.  

Hopefully having some code will provoke a little discussion, and maybe
even a little code...

/*  The auto object */

int is_clone() {
  return (sscanf(object_name(this_object()), "%*s#"));

     for blueprints of objects that are not in a .../obj/... or .../lib/...

     and the blueprints of clones don't get create() called. */

  name=object_name(this_object());

You're correct, but you miss the most important point. Upgrading works
by destructing the target program and recompiling all the leaf objects
that depend on it. Between the time that the program is destructed and
the last leaf is recompiled, there are two programs in memory, sharing
the same object name, one destructed and one not. The old program is
not destructed until no more clones/programs depend on it. If all the
leaf objects don't compile, both programs will hang around in memory
until you fix whatever errors are hindering the compilation. Quite in
general, you can have almost any number of old unfreed programs, each
haunting the system due to some lingering dependency.

The only way that old program is going to get freed is if you know
precisely what the dependency is, so you can clear it up. This in turn
requires a database of programs. Since clearly object name cannot be
used to index the program (all the unfreed issues have the same name)
the index becomes absolutely vital. It is much more than a clever
trick to get at the master object. :)

I treat clones as a completely separate matter. I do keep just such a
double linked list of clones, anchored in the clonable master object,
and I think others do as well. The kernel library maintains a link of
objects anchored in the owner, I believe. I don't see anything less
than neat about it...

Only programs are recompiled. If you have a thousand clones of foo.c
and you recompile foo.c, all the clones 'get' the new program. Apart
from debug/emergency purposes (which are good enough reasons in of
themselves), there are two occasions I can think of where you would be
happy to have such a linked list:

  A) you probably want to forbid the destruction of a clonable program
as long as there are existing clones of it -- otherwise you lose the
ability to recompile that program -- and that's testable as a pleasant
side-effect of maintaining that linked list

  B) when you need to change not just the program of a clonable but
also the data structure -- typically you write a patch() function in
the clonable that performs the data manipulation; upgrade the program
and then step through the list of all clones and call patch() in each
and every one.

Yes, it's the normal way of things to happen in DGD, nothing to do with
your OS or hardware. :-)

DGD only fully compiles one object at a time.

If you compile object A which inherits object B which has to be compiled
first, it'll finish compiling object B and then start the compilation of
object A from the start.

If you add debug statements in the path_include() driver-function you'll
find it calls those functions again as well.

Hope this helps,

Erwin.

Sorry, but I don't understand how the part after the first comma
follows from the part before.

There is a very simple way to make sure the mudlib is properly notified
about the compilation of the auto object, without a need to have
inherit_program() called: mask the compile_object() kfun, and whenever
a non-auto object is compiled with the auto object destructed, perform
the same task as in inherit_program().

If you register objects in a single mapping, you cannot register more
objects than the maximum array/mapping size.  The decision is up to you.
DGD has a (configurable through recompiling) 64K limit on the number
of objects, and a (hard) limit of 32767 elements in an array or mapping.

Correct. (As long as you don't destruct the master object and keep some
clones of it.)

Almost correct. However, the code isn't actually included. Instead, each
master object holds references to the proper versions of its inherited
programs. (Saving memory.) Old versions are thrown away when they are no
longer needed.

Correct.

Actually, I only think this will happen if there is a version clash
between several inherited objects. Example:

  A inherits nothing. (Okay, maybe the auto object.)
  B inherits the current version of A.
  C inherits an older version of A.
  D wants to inherit both B and C.

  When D is compiled, recompile(C) will be called in the driver.

Correct. (Local to a program, even. Private functions and variables can't
be accessed by inheriting objects.)

Not really. What you mean is global variables. The only effect of
declaring a (global) variable static is that it won't be saved or restored
by save_object() and restore_object(), respectively.

The kernel library divides master objects into pure programs (those that 
are stored in lib subdirectories) and ones with potential dataspaces. 
One of the benefits of this separation is that pure programs can always 
be destructed without consequences because there is no data to lose.

Master objects with namespaces -- e.g. daemon objects -- you obviously 
don't want to have to destruct every time you upgrade a basic library 
object. These objects are, instead, recompiled in place, which also 
frees the reference to the old inheritable, replacing it with the new.

Yes, destructing a clonable while there are still clones left is a very 
bad idea. You should almost certainly forbid it. Again, the link from 
the master clonable to the inheritable you're upgrading can be freed by 
recompiling the clonable in-place.

You can't recompile a clone and you don't need to. When you recompile 
the clonable, you immediately and automatically replace the master 
clonable for all those clones. You can have a mudlib with one clonable 
and a million clones of that; upgrading all clones is instantenous (at 
least from your point of view; technically they will be upgraded when 
they are swapped in).

A brief example:

   T: /lib/toolkit
inherited by
   D: /sys/daemon
and
   L: /base/lib/physical_object
which in turn is inherited by
   O: /base/obj/physical_object

So T's inheritance tree has three nodes: D, L and O. L is an internal 
node, and D and O are leaf nodes.

To recompile T, destruct all pure programs that descend inclusively from 
T, i.e. T and L. Then walk through the list of all remaining objects -- 
non-pure master objects and/or clonables -- and recompile them with a 
straight compile_object().

When you recompile the last object, the last reference to the old T 
disappears, the program is freed.

Tip: Put in debug messages in the callback functions that inform you 
that a program has been freed, so you make absolutely sure that the old 
version really is free. You might even want to enforce this in your code.

Tip: I assume you are already doing this, but remember that you can't 
index things just by program name. You can have 10 versions of 
/lib/toolkit in memory, all destructed, but 9 of them still unfreed 
because some object has yet to be recompiled. It is absolutely vital 
that you can get a list of unfreed-yet-destructed programs at any time.

The object index is available through status(obj)[ST_O_INDEX] or 
something similar to that.

Subject: [DGD] yet another object manager question.. or two

Hey guys,
I've spent the last three or four days thinking about object managers, 
and inheritance.
Basically I'm planning on writing a new object manager to support a 
persistant mudlib.
I've been reading over the archives and have a pretty good idea of what 
I need to do, and have been checking out Noah's objectd.c to see how he 
implements things.  So far so good, and I think I'm almost ready to 
start, but before I jump in the deep end, so to speak, I just want to 
see if I've missed anything obvious.


The object manager should know which inheritables a clonable inherits.
The object manager should know which inheritables are inherited by which 
inheritables.

Recompiling an inheritable should cause the object manager to:
destruct and compile the inheritable
recompile any cloneables (and LWO master objects) that use the inheritable
and..
repeat the process for each inheritable that inherits the newly 
recompiled inheritable.

Compiling and recompiling clonables and LWO master objects requires no 
special attention as clones and LWOs will automagically get updated.

The object manager should probably also keep track of clones and issues 
(... and LWOs? I dont think so..) depending on how I implement the 
above, right?


Are there any really obvious things I've missed out, or gaps in my 
logic?  Any hints would be greatly appreciated.  This is obviously just 
planning, I've yet to nail down a specific way of implementing 
everything.  I'm liking Noah's objectd as an example of using API_OBJREG 
for tracking things in a linked list.. I was starting to wonder about 
how I was going to implement that stuff.. and I see that alot of stuff 
is already handled in the kernal lib.  Excellent.

Since my name is Felix too, I'm just gonna use my nick to avoid confusion.
Thanks in advance,
Mercy

Subject: [DGD] yet another object manager question.. or two

  Your object manager stuff sounds good, at least as a quick sketched
outline.  There are a few issues you haven't mentioned (no surprise,
there are a lot of random issues).  For instance, you'll need to decide
how to populate your data structures when the ObjectD comes on-line... 
Remember that several things, including the ObjectD, had to be compiled
before the ObjectD could run at all.  I believe Geir Harald Hansen has
his ObjectD hardcode some reasonable defaults and tells you to bring up
the ObjectD as quickly as it's possible to do so.  Mine recompiles
everything in an opening pass, though that still has at least one bug
in it as well, which I haven't tracked down -- each of those
inheritables winds up logging a message later when they're recompiled. 
Not sure why, and it doesn't seem to cause any actual harm.  Anyway.

  And yeah, you're right -- the kernel lib will supply some very useful
information for you while you're doing this stuff.  It's a good place
to look for lists of objects.

  There are two reasons.  One is that the kernel library might change
in some way, which would change the correctness of the defaults.  The
other is that the code might change (for instance, another object might
be required by the ObjectD or wanted first and compiled before it), and
if somebody knowledgeable about the ObjectD doesn't change that, you'll
get some weird unexplained bugs.

  I don't like non-local effects (where you change something and
something apparently-unrelated elsewhere changes).  The problem with
hardcoded defaults is that you get non-local bugs if they're not
perfect.

  My way *does* require compiling about seven files twice.  However,
Phantasmal is so big at this point that the amount of double-compiled
code isn't a significant part of the whole.

  My approach to this was to make a DGD object which I called a 'heavy
array' that does something similar.  So rather than having a hardcoded
array of LWOs for tracking data, I have a collection object I add the
LWOs to.  Never did anything really useful with it (never needed to,
didn't have that many objects), but it would be very easy to make it
implement mapped arrays, as you have here.

If you're planning to distribute your code to others, then it's
very hard to know what some idiot who downloads your lib might
change :)

Hardcoding things makes them brittle. Brittle is not necessarily
bad, as long as you can be certain changes will never be made
that break the brittleness. As long as you are the only user
of your code, you can be reasonably sure about that. Or at worst,
you can hope that you'll remember to change the hard coding,
perhaps only after the first crash.

However, if you are going to let someone else use your code,
either because you're distributing it, or because someday your
interests are going to change and someone else is going to take
over as head wizard at the mud - then making things robust can
make life easier for the person who comes after you. Or, it can
make life easier on you if, like me, you tend to forget what
you hardcoded in the past. That's the main reason to not hardcode
things. It also makes it easier for you to go back and do changes
at fundamental levels without having to rewrite all your hardcodes.

You seem to be overlooking the indirect dependencies.  This is the
list I use for my object-db:

    DRIVER, AUTO,

    OBJREGD, RSRCD, RSRCOBJ, ACCESSD, USERD, SYS_INITD, LIB_USER,

    DEFAULT_WIZTOOL,

    TELNET_CONN, BINARY_CONN,

    DEFAULT_USER,

    SYS_OBJECTD

All #defines taken from the relevant /include/kernel/*.h files.

And this is the inherit information I'd use if I ever have to
cold-start again:

    private string *
    preloaded_inherits(string str)
    {
	switch (str) {
	case DRIVER:
	case AUTO:
	    return ({ });
	case OBJREGD:
	case RSRCD:
	case RSRCOBJ:

	case API_RSRC:
	case API_OBJREG:
	case SYS_OBJECT:
	case LIB_CONN:
	    return ({ AUTO });
	case LIB_WIZTOOL:
	    return ({ API_ACCESS, API_USER, API_RSRC });
	case DEFAULT_WIZTOOL:

	case TELNET_CONN:
	case BINARY_CONN:
	    return ({ LIB_CONN });
	case DEFAULT_USER:

	case SYS_OBJECTD:
	    return ({ API_RSRC, API_OBJREG });
	default:
	    error("Internal error, missing preloaded_inherits() entry");
	}
    }

It's not difficult, but you don't want to miss any files, no. :-)

  Yes and yes.  Though getting it working outside of Phantasmal won't
be too bad.  You need to take its tracking classes with it, the LWO
types for issues.  But that's not really a Phantasmal thing -- they're
used only by the object manager, they're just not in objectd.c.  The
only other issue that comes to mind is that it uses the Phantasmal
LogD.  The amount of that that you'll need is pretty small, but you
could always tear that out and replace it with your own logging stuff.

  The only significant feature you're losing is the "upgrade" and
"upgraded" functions, which are really only needed for full
persistence.

  Just that nobody's object manager is fully tested.  Phantasmal's has
a couple of pretty benign known bugs (I already mentioned them on this
list).  I don't know of anybody having tested Geir Hansen's as
seriously, but it presumably works about as well -- Phantasmal's hasn't
actually had a bug in a long time that wasn't related to new
functionality.

  The other thing to consider, come to think of it, is that
Phantasmal's ObjectD has more logging and will detect more weird
anomalous situations for you, at least if you check your logs.  That's
only a problem if something goes wrong, though :-)

That would probably be a good learning process, I mean, obviously 
changing some calls to the logger isnt going to be very taxing, but its 
a start, and as you point out further down, your manager's logging would 
come in handy at some point, more than likely.

If, or when? ;)

Thanks for the speedy reply, it occured to me that I was/am kind of 
jumping the gun on the ObjectD thing... I dont really need one while I'm 
constantly starting and stopping the driver and have very little code 
written.. the Kernel lib would probably handle most of what I need at 
this very early stage.  That said, it wouldnt hurt to have a working 
object manager plugged in, for when things get more complex, I'm sure.

Really I'm still trying to work out how I'm going to structure the lib, 
within the restrictions of the Kernel Lib, and I'll probably end up 
starting over once I get a proper feel for how everything works.  It's 
all too abstract until I start throwing code together.  :)

It had a nasty bug that I never tracked down, but more fatally it didn't
use the kernel library.  Just pretend it doesn't exist.

Subject: [DGD] Design question about inheritance code

     I'm trying to think about how I want to code a daemon to keep tack of 
inheritance trees, and there are a couple of ideas I came up with, for 
which I'm trying to think of good/bad things about them...

1. I'm thinking of making it so that a file can't be removed while an 
object is loaded from it. If an object is loaded from it, you need to 
destruct the object before you can remove the file. I figured this might be 
good for persistent muds, because it makes it impossible for a forgotten 
object, "/path/dir/xyz.c" to be floating around, using up memory if it 
doesn't exist in the file-system (I assume my mudlib is the only thing with 
access to the mud's directory).

2. This idea is a bit more iffy... perhaps when an object/lib/etc is 
compiled, a copy of the source code is saved in memory somewhere. When a 
full update occurs (like if auto.c is being recompiled or something), the 
object is recompiled from the source code in memory rather than the file. I 
figured this might be good, because if you're messing with a currently 
loaded file, and unbeknownst to you, somebody updates auto.c or a lib file, 
the object will be recompiled with the version of the code loaded up in 
memory rather than the new experimental version on disk. On the other hand, 
I sort of think it might not really be necessary, and could use up a lot of 
extra space (I figure I'd keep the source-file info in lightweight objects, 
so I would only have the necessary source codes loaded up in memory for any 
given thread).

Any comments or other ideas? Thanks.

My mudlib does this.  It has two types of upgrades, one to upgrade from
the current source file, and one to upgrade using the source code that
the object was compiled from.  For example, suppose I am working on an
object B, editing the source code, and someone else upgrades object A
and everything that inherits from it, which includes object B.  If B
were to be recompiled from source code it might not even compile at
all.  In this case, B ought to be recompiled from the same source code
that it was originally compiled from, without disturbing my own work
on the current source code.

Another situation: suppose that different issues of B exist, compiled
from different versions of the source code.  Then I'd like to be able
to retrieve each of those versions to look at the differences between
them.

That is precisely the thing to do. It's not a "mess" at all, it is
a very elegant solution, but it -is- a bit of an undertaking to get
all the kinks worked out.

Yes.

Probably, but DGD is still a minimalist design. If it can be done
quickly and well in LPC, why clutter up the driver?

It "reads" the source file, but it certainly modifies the object. :-)

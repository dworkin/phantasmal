    <h1> Your MUDLib's Directory Structure </h1>

    <p> Where do I <b>put</b> all this stuff? </p>

    <p> You've probably asked yourself that several times already,
      just getting started.  When you make a new library, or a new
      clonable, or a new data file, where do you <i>put</i> it?  This
      document can get you started. </p>

    <p> Where you put stuff is surprisingly important.  The Kernel
      MUDLib hardcodes a <i>lot</i> of behavior according to the path
      to a given file.
      That includes a lot of information about who has access to what,
      and whether an object is inheritable, clonable or an LWO.  So
      let's hit some basic guidelines. </p>

    <h2> Where do specific object types go? </h2>

    <p> You'll need to put a &quot;/lib/&quot; directory somewhere in
      the path to every library (inheritable).  The Kernel MUDLib
      requires it.  It's good practice.  It's good documentation.  Do
      it.  You'll also need to <i>not</i> put &quot;/obj/&quot; or
      &quot;/data/&quot; anywhere in that path.  For more information
      about those paths, and whether an object is cloneable or
      inheritable, see the page about <a
      href="Inheritance.html">Inheritance</a> in the Kernel
      Library.  It'll explain what's mandatory. </p>

    <p> Daemons are objects like any others, but they're meant to be
      used by doing a find_object on them and calling their methods
      with call_other.  Daemons often wind up in a directory with
      &quot;/sys/&quot; in the name instead of &quot;/lib/&quot;,
      &quot;/data/&quot; or &quot;/obj/&quot;.  This is purely
      optional, mostly a form of documentation.  You're just saying
      that you plan to use objects in that directory as daemons.  It's
      still a good idea. </p>

    <h2> What about Data? </h2>

    <p> This one's important too, but for different reasons.  You
      don't need to have a particular piece of your path to open a
      file with read_file().  But different paths require different
      permissions to access.  For instance, stuff in
      &quot;/usr/System&quot; is readable and writable only by the
      privileged admin user (by default) and by anybody you explicitly
      grant access to.  In general, permissions are given
      per-directory You'll want to set aside a place somewhere under
      /usr/ to put any piece of data, because generally only code in
      that same user's directory can read it (or everybody can, if you
      put it in &quot;/usr/Foo/open/&quot;). </p>

    <p> Files with passwords in them are a good example.  While
      passwords are encrypted, they're not unbreakable, so often you
      want to avoid giving people read access.  That keeps them from
      using a password cracking program, or at least makes it harder.
      You may need to give certain wizards read access to the System
      directory but not want them to be able to read all the save
      files.  By putting the save files somewhere else (say under
      /usr/Secret or something), you can prevent anybody that doesn't
      have full admin permission from being able to read or write the
      user data files.  Note that you'll have to write your password
      code carefully so that <i>it</i> can still read it! </p>

    <h2> What directories does the Kernel Library treat specially? </h2>

    <p> The Kernel Library checks various things about the path in many
    of its operations.  Let's look at different operations, and what
    the Kernel Library checks about the path for each one.
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li> A lot of Kernel MUDLib functions can only be called from
        objects under /usr/System.  Objects under /usr/System are also
        allowed to read and write a lot of things automatically,
        without having to check permissions.  They're also the only
        objects that can inherit from objects under /kernel.  Only
        objects under /usr/System may destruct objects that they don't
        own, though even they can't destruct an object under /kernel.
        Only objects under /usr/System are allowed to call swapout(),
        dump_state(), and shutdown() usefully. </li>

      <li> Only objects <i>outside</i> the /usr/System directory can
        have a special nonstandard AUTO object. </li>

      <li> The /kernel and /include/kernel directories and their
        subdirectories are guaranteed writable to nobody.  Files under
        /kernel or /include/kernel may not be written to or deleted.
        Directories cannot be made or destroyed there, and files
        cannot be renamed to or from those directories.  Objects under
        /kernel can only be cloned by other objects under
        /kernel. </li>

      <li> You can't call_other on any object with /lib in its path.
        You can't find those objects with find_object(), you can't
        call their functions.  You can only inherit objects with /lib
        in their paths and without /obj/ or /data/ in their paths. </li>

      <li> Files with /include in the path can always be included,
        regardless of read access. (TEST ME, with and without a '..'
	in the path) </li>

      <li> Files outside of /usr/System are allowed to have a special
        nonstandard AUTO object.  If a non-System file includes AUTO
        from /include/std.h, and an objectd is registered, the Kernel
        Library will call the path_special() function of the objectd
        to determine what AUTO object should be used.  If a value
        other than &quot;&quot; or nil is returned, it is assumed to
        be the path to the nonstandard AUTO object.  This can be used
        for scripts or other controlled access since built-in
        functions can be overridden by an AUTO object. </li>

      <li> Objects in /kernel have no maximum rlimits(), so they could
        theoretically loop infinitely or crash for lack of stack
        space.  In practice, this essentially never happens.  Objects
        in /usr/System may voluntarily choose not to limit their
        number of ticks in rlimits().  This means they may
        occasionally loop infinitely, especially if coded
        poorly. </li>

      <li> Files outside /usr, or in /usr/foo/open (for any value of foo)
        are readable to everybody.  Except stuff under /kernel/, that's
	not necessarily open to reading. </li>

      <li> A user has full access of every object and file under his
        own home directory.  Objects under that user's directory have
        full access to each other, and to files under the user's home
        directory. </li>

      <li> The create() function that gets called automatically on an
        object will be called with the 'clone' argument only if /obj/
        or /data/ is in the object's path.  Otherwise it will be called
	with no argument. </li>

      <li> Libraries not under /kernel require you to have read access
        to compile them.  Non-libraries, anything under /kernel, and
        anything compiled from sources requires write access instead
        of read access if you want to compile it.  There's an
        exception if the object doing the compiling is under
        /usr/System.  And anything not under a /usr/XXX directory can
        be compiled by anybody.
        </li>

      <li> An object must have an /obj/ in its path, but no /data/ or
        /lib/, to be clonable.  Objects outside of the /usr/XXX/ area
        can't clone another object.  Objects that aren't under
        /usr/System need read access to an object to clone it. </li>

      <li> Only objects in /usr/System can pass a uid argument to
        clone_object or new_object.  That's a way to change who owns
        the new clone or LWO.  You should probably never do
        this. </li>

      <li> An object to be cloned as an LWO with new_object must have
        /data/ in the path, but not /obj/ or /lib/. </li>

      <li> Objects outside of /usr/System get an edited call_trace,
        one with no arguments included. </li>

      <li> Objects outside of /usr/System don't get arguments in the
        output of status(), and nobody is allowed to see the callouts
        of objects in /kernel. </li>

      <li> Certain Kernel objects get direct call_outs rather than the
        usual tracked ones.  If you don't know what this means, don't
	worry about it.  You'll sleep better. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Specific Projects </h2>

    <p> This is part of the Adding Stuff section, so what kind of stuff
      should you add?  One simple answer is &quot;everything&quot;, since
      this document tells you where everything goes.  But there are also
      some projects you can undertake to improve your MUDLib. </p>

    <p> For instance, a simple thing you can do is to move your user
      data from its current save location to another, as we suggest
      above.  Mainly you'll need to modify &quot;user.c&quot;.  Go
      give it a try! </p>

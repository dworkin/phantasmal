    <h1> Your MUDLib's Directory Structure </h1>

    <p> Where do I <b>put</b> all this stuff? </p>

    <p> You've probably asked yourself that several times already, just
      getting started.  When you make a new library, or a new clonable,
      or a new data file, where do you <i>put</i> it?  You've got a
      number of choices, and many of them we won't even touch on here.
      Don't treat this as being the be-all and end-all on this subject,
      but it can get you started. </p>

    <p> Where you put stuff is surprisingly important.  The Kernel MUDLib
      hardcodes a <i>lot</i> of stuff according to paths, including a lot
      of information about who has access to what, and whether an object
      is inheritable, clonable or an LWO.  So let's hit some basic
      guidelines. </p>

    <h2> Where do specific object types go? </h2>

    <p> You'll need to put a &quot;/lib/&quot; directory somewhere in the
      path to every library (inheritable).  The Kernel MUDLib requires it.
      It's good
      practice.  It's good documentation.  Do it. </p>

    <p> If you're using lightweight objects, or LWOs, you'll need to do
      the same with a &quot;/data/&quot; directory in the path.  Note
      that this isn't required for the libraries that the LWO object
      inherits.  Those use &quot;/lib/&quot; just like any other
      library. </p>

    <p> There's a strong convention that clonables should have
      &quot;/obj/&quot; in their path in the same way.  You don't have
      to do it.  In fact, daemons (below) are a common, specific
      exception.  Still, I highly recommend it in general.  It's good
      documentation for other people looking at your MUDLib, and the
      Kernel MUDLib <i>does</i> do a few things differently depending on
      whether you have it. </p>

    <p> Daemons are clonables like any others, but they're meant to be
      used by doing a find_object on them and calling their methods with
      call_other.  They may be technically clonable, or may have guards
      in their create() routines that prevent cloning.  They often
      wind up in a directory with &quot;/sys/&quot; in the name instead
      of &quot;/lib/&quot; or &quot;/obj/&quot;.  This is purely
      optional, mostly a form of documentation.  You're just saying that
      you plan to use objects in that directory as a daemon. </p>

    <h2> What about Data? </h2>

    <p> This one's important too, but for different reasons.  The
      Kernel MUDLib doesn't explicitly prevent paths from being opened
      with read_file(), which is the way pretty much any data file is
      accessed.  But different paths require different permissions to
      access.  For instance, stuff in &quot;/usr/System&quot; is
      writable only by the privileged System user by default. </p>

    <p> You may not want to keep the user data there.  While passwords
      are encrypted, you may need to give certain wizards read access
      to System but not want them to be able to read all the
      save files.  If so, or out of sense of following
      conventions you should probably move it to /save, which is not
      only not world-readable, but has specific guards in the Kernel
      MUDLib for additional security.  It's a great place to put private
      stuff that only very privileged code can access.  It's meant to
      be. </p>

    <h2> Specific Projects </h2>

    <p> This is part of the Adding Stuff section, so what kind of stuff
      should you add?  One simple answer is &quot;everything&quot;, since
      this document tells you where everything goes.  But there are also
      some projects you can undertake to improve your MUDLib. </p>

    <p> For instance, a simple thing you can do is to move your user
      data from its current save location to &quot;/save&quot;, as
      we suggest above.  Mainly you'll need to modify &quot;user.c&quot;.
      Go give it a try! </p>

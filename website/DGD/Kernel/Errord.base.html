<h1>Adding an Error Daemon</h1>

<p>One of the things you'll want to do is have your MUD respond
well to errors. I know, I know, it's not as if <i>you</i> would
ever make an error. But you've got builders and co-coders who may
not share your tremendous level of perfection. For their benefit
you'll need to handle errors from time to time.</p>

<p>So how do you do it? Well, with the Kernel MUDLib there's a
specific way to do it. You just register an errord with the Kernel
MUDLib to catch your errors for you. Your errord can do whatever
your little heart desires -- inform the current user, inform an
administrator, log it to a file, analyze the error and provide
blow-by-blow commentary, do a stack crawl... Any or all of the
above. No sweat.</p>

<p>Of course, <i>debugging</i> an errord is a mess, because by the
time you do anything with it you're already handling an error. To
make this easier, I like first adding a command called something
like "runtime_error" for admins to use -- it'll do something
obviously boneheaded, cause an error, and get your errord to kick
in. If you've got a command that's not especially well-debugged
then that'll do just fine too as long as you know what the problem
is and can cause it on demand.</p>

<p>If you're going to register an errord, first you'll need to
<i>have</i> an errord. I put mine in /usr/System/sys/errord.c and
this article assumes you do the same. It doesn't much matter as
long as it's a clonable. That's kind of funny, because you'll
never, ever clone it. It may not make much sense at first blush,
but remember that you never inherit from clonables and you never
make lightweight objects from them. If there was a kind of object
that you couldn't do any of that with <i>and</i> you couldn't
clone, then errord would be that.</p>

<p>So what's in an errord? The Kernel MUDLibs doc in
".../mud/doc/hooks" says:</p>
<pre>
void set_error_manager(object errord)   [System only]

    Install an error manager, in which the following functions can be called
    afterwards:

    * void runtime_error(string error, int caught, mixed **trace)

        A runtime error has occurred.

    * void atomic_error(string error, int atom, mixed **trace)

        A runtime error has occurred in atomic code.

    * void compile_error(string file, int line, string error)

        A compile-time error has occurred.
</pre>

<p>So there are three functions (runtime_error, atomic_error and
compile_error) that you'll need to worry about.</p>

<p>We're not really going to worry about atomic_error in this
document -- you only get those when you're in an atomic operation
and something goes wrong. Maybe later we'll have an "Atomic
Operations" article in the Adding Stuff series, but until then the
following stub will work well enough:</p>
<pre>
void atomic_error(string error, int atom, mixed** trace)
{
  send_message("Atomic error!\n");
}
</pre>

<p>That's far from perfect. It won't catch problems during startup
or other times that there's no particular user doing anything such
as login. It also won't tell you any details, like the stack
trace.</p>

<p>If you have a system log I recommend logging any errors there,
<i>not</i> just informing the user who caused the error. I mention
this because all the same things are going to apply to
compile_error:</p>
<pre>
void compile_error(string file, int line, string error)
{
  send_message("Compile error in " + file + ", line " + line + ":\n"
               + error + "\n");
  write_file("/error.log", "Compile err " + file + " " + line + ":"
             + error + "\n");
}
</pre>

<p>So if you were more sensible, you'd also want to log this to the
system log -- much as the write_file at the end does. Compile
errors are less likely (though not impossible) on login, but
they're also *more* likely on startup. They tend to come
accompanied by runtime errors, and runtime errors come with stack
traces.</p>

<p>If you're experienced at all in debugging, you're well aware of
just how useful a stack trace can be. Knowing not just where the
error is, but who initiated the action that went wrong will let you
know which recently-modified components are likely to be involved
in the problem. Runtime errors come with stack traces, so we should
print one out. Of course, that's a nontrivial bit of code, so if
you're lazy like me, you'll prefer not to write it yourself.</p>

<p>One place you can get it is from the Kernel MUDLib's
runtime_error function in "/kernel/sys/driver.c". If you were to
shamelessly steal it and tack another write_file to "/error.log" on
the end you might get a resulting function something like this:</p>
<pre>
void runtime_error(string error, int caught, mixed** trace)
{
  int size, i, len;
  string line, progname, function, str, objname;
  object obj;

  str = error;

  if(caught != 0) {
    str += " [caught]";
  }
  str += "\n";

  size = sizeof(trace) - 1;
  for(i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
    progname = trace[i][TRACE_PROGNAME];
    len = trace[i][TRACE_LINE];
    if(len == 0) {
      line = "    ";
    } else {
      line = "    " + (string)len;
      line = line[strlen(line) - 4 ..];
    }

    function = trace[i][TRACE_FUNCTION];
    len = strlen(function);
    if(progname == AUTO &amp;&amp; i != size - 1 &amp;&amp; len &gt; 3) {
      switch(function[..2]) {
      case "bad":
      case "_F_":
      case "_Q_":
        continue;
      }
    }
    if(len &lt; 17) {
      function += "                 "[len..];
    }

    objname = trace[i][TRACE_OBJNAME];
    if(progname != objname) {
      len = strlen(progname);
      if(len &lt; strlen(objname) &amp;&amp; progname == objname[.. len - 1]
         &amp;&amp; objname[len] == '#') {
        objname = objname[len..];
      }
      str += line + " " + function + " " + progname + " (" + objname
        + ")\n";
    } else {
      str += line + " " + function + " " + progname + "\n";
    }
  }

  send_message("Runtime error: " + str);
  if(caught == 0 &amp;&amp; this_user() &amp;&amp; (obj=this_user()-&gt;query_user())) {
    obj-&gt;message(str);
  }
  write_file("/error.log", str);
}
</pre>

<p>Of course all of these errors have the caveat mentioned above
&mdash; they can get lost since nobody may be receiving messages
when they trigger. For that reason, I <i>strongly</i> recommend
checking your system log -- "/error.log" for the above code.
Basically, any time something fails silently see if new stuff got
tacked onto that file.</p>

<p>You'll also need to add your errord to your initd.c. So over in
"/usr/System/initd.c" go ahead and add some lines:</p>
<pre>
  if(!find_object("/usr/System/sys/errord")) {
    compile_object("/usr/System/sys/errord");
  }
  driver-&gt;set_error_manager(find_object("/usr/System/sys/errord"));
</pre>

<p>("driver" should point to your driver object or you should
replace it with the path to the driver.)</p>

<p>I do this after registering the telnet manager but do things in
an order that works for you. Remember the earlier in the sequence
you start up the errord the more things you can have it help you
debug.</p>

<p>So that's it? Not quite. Some itty-bitty other stuff:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to include &lt;kernel/kernel.h&gt; and
  &lt;trace.h&gt; from your file -- some of the symbols that the
  stolen code above uses will require them. Usually you'll need
  trace.h any time you play with call traces.</li>

  <li>Be aware that if your error handler causes errors you'll
  probably have problems.</li>

  <li>With compile errors you'll tend to get a string of them
  followed by a runtime error. Expect this. It's your friend.</li>
</ul>

<p>So go ahead and put this together and after a little debugging
and other poking it should run. If you haven't seen it do its thing
yet, you can type something like "code ({ "bob" }) [7] " which will
cause a nice little "Array index out of range" error with stack
trace. Have a look in /error.log, and you should see something like
this:</p>
<pre>
Array index out of range [caught]
  46 receive_message   /kernel/obj/telnet (#25)
 226 receive_message   /kernel/lib/connection (/kernel/obj/telnet#25)
 227 receive_message   /usr/System/obj/user (#26)
  37 input             /usr/System/obj/wiztool (#27)
 734 call_limited      /kernel/lib/auto (/usr/System/obj/wiztool#27)
  97 process           /usr/System/obj/wiztool (#27)
 849 cmd_code          /kernel/lib/wiztool (/usr/System/obj/wiztool#27)
  10 exec              /usr/admin/_code
</pre>

<h3>Specific Projects</h3>

<p>So what can you do from here? Lots of things. We've mentioned
some possibilities in the article itself, but quick projects
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fix up the formatting of the errors and make them more
  readable</li>

  <li>Tell all admins logged in that an error has occurred and if
  possible who caused it. You may want to let them later query the
  error and get the stack.</li>

  <li>Make this work with atomic functions. Remember that you can't
  write to a file inside an atomic function so if somebody is
  catching an error in an atomic function you can't write to the
  error log!</li>
</ul>

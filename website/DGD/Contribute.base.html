<h2>Giving Back to the DGD Community</h2>

<p>The DGD community is trying to give you a good time, as a
programmer or as a player. That's what we're here for. That's what
I do, what Skotos does, what everybody starting a MUD is trying to
do. You may want to give back to the community in some way. You can
give more of the same benefits that you most enjoyed, or however
you're best able to contribute. This page is full of suggestions
for things the community could benefit from, and would enjoy.</p>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>Build a new MUDLib for DGD. Every one helps. Or contribute to an
existing one. Melville hasn't been updated in ages. We don't have a
DGD-ized Lima version. Phantasmal can always use the help. There
are plenty of new MUDLibs that haven't taken off yet like Aexeon
and The Last Bastion. Go out and contribute to a MUDLib, or start
your own.</p>

<p>Write a subsystem that other people can easily use. The
Phantasmal UNQ system and Help system have both been used by other
MUD libraries. They're designed to be simple and modular so you can
easily use them. If you write something like that, people will use
it, and MUDLibs may adopt it. And hey, it's another code
example.</p>

<p>Along the same lines as the above, here are some things people
have been talking about doing for awhile, but aren't freely
available...</p>

<ul>
  <li>A passive FTP daemon would be wonderful. We need one.</li>

  <li>A better telnet terminal for binary sockets. This'll let you
  do color without having to modify DGD.</li>

  <li>An IMUD3 daemon. That requires a modified DGD, or writing an
  external daemon that also connects to your MUD server.</li>

  <li>An integrated HTTP/web server</li>

  <li>A really good English parser</li>
</ul>

<p>Write one of these and everybody will thank you. Many people
will use it. And I'll probably integrate it into Phantasmal, if
it's in the public domain.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>

<p>Make some documentation. LPC needs documentation. All existing
MUDLibs do. DGD certainly does. Pick something and write
documentation. The most valuable documentation at this point is
probably "how to code" documentation and "how to set up a new MUD".
But if you've had problems getting started, write up your
experiences and how you solved your problems. Chances are good that
somebody else will have the same problems later on.</p>

<p>Build a MUD area. Write new rooms, objects and creatures for one
MUDLib or another. Stock areas may get routinely badmouthed, but
they also get <i>used</i>, and people can actually <i>play</i>
them. Make sure to license your areas so that people can easily
modify them. That way people won't instantly know the solution
every time they walk into a place that uses your area, and they can
enjoy your puzzles (and new puzzles added by others!) all the
more.</p>

<p>Put together a web site. Do a fan site for an existing DGD MUD.
Make a forum for new MUD administrators to share triumphs and
frustrations. Do a documentation site or a set of open forums, or
some other way to build community. While we're not hurting for
these the way we're hurting for most other stuff on this page,
every little bit helps.</p>

<h3>Filthy Lucre</h3>

<p>Get a Skotos account, and maybe a premium one. Skotos pays for a
DGD commercial license, and those licenses aren't cheap. Pay Skotos
and Skotos will stay afloat. And that keeps Dworkin eating, which
keeps him maintaining DGD.</p>

<p>If you work for a large company, propose doing a project on top
of DGD. Yahoo Chat works this way, and pays for another commercial
DGD license. If you're doing something high-volume that needs to be
robust, DGD will save you a *lot* of time and money -- it's worth
the license, and it helps the DGD community out. The more companies
that use DGD, the more time and effort Dworkin can spend on keeping
it going. If it gets popular enough, all those companies will want
lots of new features. And new features benefit you and me.</p>

<p>Many SourceForge projects take donations. My own project,
Phantasmal, doesn't, but you may find some worthy recipient that
will. I can't really recommend this option since it's rarely money
that's holding back opensource projects. But just contributing
money <i>is</i> an option. So if you just want to settle your
feeling of debt to the DGD community, you can certainly do it.</p>

      <p> Thanks to Felix Croes, aka Dworkin.
	DGD is an incredible driver.  With a little
	more documentation, a better
	<a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">MUDLib</a>
	and some luck
	we can watch it sweep the world! </p> </font>

    <p> This is on the web.  That means it's pretty questionably
      maintained.  Information on DGD has aged well so far, but that's
      not a guarantee about anything.  I take no responsibility for
      the quality, accuracy or age of anything here.

      You can use the stuff on the site as the basis of any other DGD
      documentation you feel like.  Anything I have personally written
      (unless marked otherwise) is hereby introduced into the public
      domain.  I grant a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free right to
      use, modify, distribute and sell anything I've written and
      posted to these pages (except the DGD textbook, which I'm not
      allowed to do that with).  Some content is quoted from other
      sources and I do not have the right to declare it public domain.

      Please note:  modifications dates are per-page, so if this page is
      old (or very new), that indicates nothing about anything else within
      the overall DGD site.  Thank you.

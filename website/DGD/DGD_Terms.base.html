<h2>Glossary of DGD Terms and Concepts</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Afuns</dt>

  <dd>An Afun, short for "Auto Function", is defined in the Auto
  object and behaves like an Kfun. It may override an existing
  Kfun.</dd>

  <dt>Applies</dt>

  <dd>Applies are functions in the MUDLib that the DGD driver
  calls. These are pretty much always in the Driver object, at
  least in DGD. They're not the same as Hooks because Hooks are
  called by other code in the MUDLib, not by the DGD driver binary
  itself.</dd>

  <dt>Atomic Functions</dt>

  <dd>Atomic functions are very, very uncommon even in LPMUDs. DGD
  is really pretty much unique in having them. An Atomic Function
  is one which, if it gets an error, basically never happened. Any
  variables, global data and whatnot that it played with will be
  back in the same state as if the function had never run. Atomic
  functions may not read or write network connections, nor read or
  write files. Otherwise, they can do anything allowable in DGD
  LPC.</dd>

  <dt>Auto object</dt>

  <dd>The second LPC object created. All later LPC objects,
  everything except the Auto object itself and the Driver object,
  inherit from Auto. Auto is a common place to override the
  standard DGD Kfuns with versions tuned for your particular
  MUDLib.</dd>

  <dt>Clonable</dt>

  <dd>In MUDLibs that separate Inheritable and Clonable, a Program
  which may be cloned. It may have variables and other state, its
  functions may be called and it may be recompiled in place. In
  MUDLibs that don't separate the two, this distinction doesn't
  matter, but then a reboot may be necessary to upgrade objects.
  Compare Inheritable.</dd>

  <dt>Clone</dt>

  <dd>A clone is basically an "instance", in an object oriented
  sense, of a master object. Every clone shares its code (called a
  Program) with the master but each maintains an individual copy of
  the data.</dd>

  <dt>Driver object</dt>

  <dd>The first LPC object created. It field a number of hooked
  called (see Hooks) from the actual DGD driver, the real C
  code.</dd>

  <dt>Driver program</dt>

  <dd>The actual binary program in C, not LPC, that starts up the
  whole LPC environment and begins running the interpreted parts.
  It may be extended with a variety of packages and extensions, or
  be normal "vanilla" DGD. The driver implements common functions
  that programs can't do for themselves and that any big program is
  likely to need. See also MUDLib.</dd>

  <dt>Efuns</dt>

  <dd>Short for External Functions. Efuns are functions which are
  defined or overridden by the MUDLib's auto object. Basically,
  just like AFuns.</dd>

  <dt>Execution Rounds</dt>

  <dd>Execution rounds are what used to be called DGD Threads. An
  execution round occurs in response to an event. Any event will be
  responded to by some piece of LPC code somewhere in your MUD. One
  run of that code is called an execution round. Whenever an ER
  ends a bunch of stuff happens. For instance, objects are swapped
  to disk, and send_message and send_datagram actually send.
  Shutdowns, reboots and state dumps wait for the current ER to end
  before they occur... So don't do your post-dump or post-shutdown
  stuff right after your shutdown call. Wait until the current ER
  has ended so you're sure shutdown has already been called.</dd>

  <dt>Hooks</dt>

  <dd>Functions which get called when certain things happen.
  They're like event handlers in some languages except that, as
  with Java interfaces, you don't get to pick their names, you just
  supply an Object with all the right function names defined. You
  register with another part of the MUDLib for a Hook -- if the
  driver just does it automatically, it's an Apply instead of a
  Hook.</dd>

  <dt>Inheritable</dt>

  <dd>In MUDLibs that separate Inheritable and Clonable, a Program
  from which other programs may inherit. It may not be cloned, none
  of its functions can be directly called and it may have no
  variables nor any other kind of state. If it needs to be
  dynamically upgraded, it will be destroyed rather than recompiled
  in place, and it will be regenerated on demand from the new
  source. This is restrictive, but without it you may need to
  reboot the server to upgrade objects. Compare Clonable.</dd>

  <dt>Issue</dt>

  <dd>If you stumble into the thorny territory of writing your own
  object manager, as you'll need to do in order to upgrade
  (recompile) objects without rebooting for a Persistent MUD,
  you'll probably need to know about Issues. An Issue of an object,
  in particular of an Inheritable object, is a compiled version of
  that object. Until every object inheriting from a given Issue has
  been destructed or recompiled, the Issue is still there, lurking.
  An object manager can be careful to destroy any old Issues when
  it recompiles a new one, but that's a nontrivial undertaking. It
  is easiest to keep track of issues by their object index, which
  will be different for each issue. See the example object manager
  code on the main page and the mailing list archives.</dd>

  <dt>Kfuns</dt>

  <dd>Kfuns are DGD Kernel Functions, not to be confused with the
  Kernel MUDLib, a different beast. These are the basic things that
  DGD lets your MUDLib do. The MUDLib may override them so that the
  actual objects your wizards create use Kfuns different from the
  ones DGD supplies. See Auto object.</dd>

  <dt>LFuns</dt>

  <dd>Lfuns are local functions, functions local to a given object
  or program.</dd>

  <dt>Lightweight Object</dt>

  <dd>DGD is a disk-based MUD, and swaps out its objects regularly
  (indeed, constantly) to a swap file. Little things like member
  variables (including arrays and mappings), get swapped as part of
  the object they're part of. If they're referenced by another
  object, then instead of being shared they'll be copied into the
  other object as well when the current Thead (qv) of execution
  completes. LWOs have .c files that define them, but act otherwise
  just like arrays and mappings -- they're part of the object that
  references them, swap with it and are copied if multiple objects
  reference them.</dd>

  <dt>LWO</dt>

  <dd>A Lightweight Object.</dd>

  <dt>Master</dt>

  <dd>A clone is produced from a master object using the
  clone_object kfun. In some MUDLibs, the master must be a Clonable
  and may not be an Inheritable.</dd>

  <dt>MUDLib</dt>

  <dd>A MUDLib is the layer of LPC on top of the Driver program
  that runs the actual game or application you want. The MUDLib
  implements stuff you know your wizards or other users will want
  to do that not every program built on DGD will necessarily want.
  This includes things like rooms, mobiles and objects. Remember,
  not only do different MUDs implement these things in different
  ways, but DGD can be used for pretty much any kind of network
  server, not just MUDs.</dd>

  <dt>Object</dt>

  <dd>A chunk of code which may inherit from other objects. It
  tracks its own data. The same thing as a Program.</dd>

  <dt>Object manager</dt>

  <dd>To have a Persistent MUD, you'll need to keep track of what
  inherits and clones what so that you can recompile or destroy all
  the right stuff at all the right times. There's a massive amount
  of deep, confusing mailing list traffic on this deep, confusing
  topic. To cut to the chase, you can try installing Geir Harald
  Hansen's Object Manager from the top page's LPC Code
  Examples.</dd>

  <dt>Persistent MUD</dt>

  <dd>A Persistent MUD is one that never does the usual save,
  recompile, reboot routine. Instead it keeps its memory state
  around and recompiles stuff in-place. This is very, very hard to
  do in most languages and impossible in pretty much every other
  MUD server. That's why DGD is so proud of being able to do it
  well. To do this properly, you'll need a MUDLib that separates
  Inheritable and Clonable objects -- nothing that's both inherited
  from and cloned. See Inheritable, Clonable, and Object
  Manager.</dd>

  <dt>Program</dt>

  <dd>The LPC code of an object. In many MUDLibs, it must be either
  an Inheritable or a Clonable but may not be both.</dd>

  <dt>Thread</dt>

  <dd>A thread of execution -- if multiple Threads are occurring,
  that means multiple things are happening more-or-less at the same
  time, and maybe <i>really</i> at the same time if you've got
  multiple processors running DGD. This is also the old, confusing,
  now-obsolete term for an Execution Round (qv). Note that DGD code
  always acts exactly as though it's single-threaded, even when
  it's actually running multithreaded. How it does this is Deep
  Voodoo, and should be questioned only by those with a profound
  understanding of Atomic Functions (qv).</dd>

  <dt>Tick</dt>

  <dd>A tick is a hardware-independent abstraction of CPU usage.
  DGD runs on multiple platforms, and you'd like them to have
  similar behavior with respect to things like CPU quotas. So DGD
  rates various operations by how processor-intensive they are, and
  marks off ticks accordingly. Tick usage can be limited by the
  rlimits() construct, and monitored by status(). The Kernel
  Library has a quota system for ticks that prevents you using too
  many at a time, or too many total.</dd>

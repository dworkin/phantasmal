  <h1> Why Use DGD? </h1>

  <p>
    DGD is a networked server and a language environment.  It uses an
    object-oriented variant of C called LPC and provides powerful
    special-purpose extensions to that language.  True to its roots,
    DGD is best known as a server for multiplayer networked games
    called MUDs.  That's where the original LPC language came from,
    and it's still a common use of even industrial-strength servers
    like DGD.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many good reasons to use DGD if you're building a MUD,
    and a surprising number even if you're building some other kind of
    networked server.  Yahoo Chat, for instance, is built on top of
    DGD.  First, a few bullet points about DGD...
  </p>

  <h2>DGD is an amazing server:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Because it's <a
      href="LibWriting/Persistence.html">persistent</a>.  That doesn't
      just mean that the game world persists or that you can save and
      restore.  For DGD, that means that the LPC objects can be dumped
      to a state file on shutdown and reloaded at startup without
      writing specific object-saving or object-reloading code.
      Pointers and object state are maintained transparently.
    </li>

    <li>
      Because it does what's necessary to be persistent, such as
      allowing you to recompile every LPC object in place without
      rebooting, disconnecting users or losing data.  You can even do
      it incrementally without stopping what you're doing.  New object
      data shows up and old data disappears quietly and transparently.
    </li>

    <li>
      Because it's clean and well-designed.  Dworkin works hard to
      make DGD the cleanest, most secure LPMUD out there.  DGD's LPC
      dialect really shows it.  DGD resembles an Operating System or a
      language environment (which it is) much more than a MUD server.
    </li>

    <li>
      Because Dworkin works hard.  New features and bug fixes are
      added all the time to the experimental (but usually very stable)
      versions of DGD.  You see stuff that other MUD servers don't
      have and won't have any time soon like atomic functions with
      full rollback.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> What Does DGD Do That Other Drivers and
    Servers Don't? </h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The rlimits() structure can be used to limit how much stack
      space and processor time a given function can take.  If
      the time or space runs out, the function is interrupted
      cleanly and smoothly without restarting the interpreter.
    </li>
    <li>
      DGD is disk-based, so it can store massive datasets without
      massive amounts of RAM.  Its swapping is efficient, well
      tested and highly configurable.
    </li>
    <li>
      DGD is highly secure and strongly tested in commercial
      products like the Skotos servers and Yahoo Chat (formerly
      iChat).
    </li>
    <li>
      Most LPC environments absolutely forbid commercial use.  DGD,
      however, can be used commercially if you purchase a license
      from Dworkin or from <a href="Skotos/">Skotos</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      DGD allows precompiled code and server extensions -- for thost
      times when it really has to run at full native speed.
    </li>
    <li>
      DGD allows you to recompile absolutely any LPC object on the
      fly and change anything or everything about it.  It also has the
      management code and hooks to let you usefully do this.  Since
      DGD does far more in LPC than most drivers, this lets you
      reconfigure anything about your game nearly instantly, and run
      your development servers on the same LPC data without an
      interruption for days, months or years.
    </li>
    <li>
      DGD allows you to dump all game state in one lump, and reload
      that statedump with a new DGD version.  To upgrade DGD, just
      dump state, upgrade the DGD server code and restart.  All your
      objects, files and players are exactly where they were.  Only
      your current network connections are lost, and absolutely
      everything about DGD can be upgraded this way.  You can upgrade
      your library without even that much disruption.
    </li>
    <li>
      DGD's dialect of LPC includes a lot of new extensions for better
      typechecking and error checking than most LPC servers.  It
      removes several redundant and insecure features (like shadowing
      and hardcoded snooping) that can prevent a library from being
      securable.

  </ul>

    <h1> Why Use DGD? </h1>

    <font size="4">

    <p>
      DGD is a networked server and a language environment.  It uses
      an object-oriented variant of C called LPC and provides powerful
      special-purpose extensions to that language.  True to its roots,
      DGD is best known as a server for multiplayer networked games
      called MUDs.  That's where the original LPC language came from,
      and it's still a primary use of even industrial-strength servers
      like DGD.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many good reasons to use DGD if you're building a MUD,
      and a surprising number even if you're building some other kind
      of networked server.  Yahoo Chat, for instance, is built on top
      of DGD.  First, a few bullet points about DGD...
    </p>

    <h2>DGD is an amazing server:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Because it's persistent.  That doesn't just mean that the game
	world persists or that you can save and restore.  For DGD,
	that means that the LPC objects can be dumped to a state file
	on shutdown and reloaded at startup without saving, messing
	around, or missing a beat.
      </li>
      <li>
	Because it does what's necessary to be persistent, such as
	allowing you to recompile every LPC object in place without
	rebooting or losing data.  You can even do it incrementally
	without stopping what you're doing.  New object data shows up
	and old data disappears quietly and transparently.
      </li>
      <li>
	Because it's clean and well-designed.  Dworkin works hard to
	make DGD the cleanest, most secure LPMUD out there.  DGD's LPC
	dialect really shows it.  DGD resembles an Operating System or
	a language environment (which it is) much more than a MUD
	server.
      </li>
      <li>
	Because Dworkin works hard.  New features and bug fixes are
	added all the time to the experimental (but usually very
	stable) versions of DGD.  You see stuff that other MUD servers
	don't have and won't have any time soon like atomic functions
	with full rollback.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> What Does DGD Do That Other Drivers and
      Servers Don't? </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	The rlimits() structure can be used to limit how much stack
	space and processor time a given function can take.  If
	the time or space runs out, the function is interrupted
	cleanly and smoothly without restarting the interpreter.
      </li>
      <li>
	DGD is disk-based, so it can store massive datasets without
	massive amounts of RAM.  Its swapping is efficient, well
	tested and highly configurable.
      </li>
      <li>
	DGD is highly secure and strongly tested in commercial
	products like the Skotos servers and Yahoo Chat (formerly
	iChat).
      </li>
      <li>
	Most LPC environments absolutely forbid commercial use.  DGD,
	however, can be used commercially under license.
      </li>
      <li>
	DGD allows precompiled code and server extensions -- for when
	it really has to run at full native speed.
      </li>
      <li>
	DGD allows you to precompile absolutely any LPC object on the
	fly and change anything or everything about it.  It also has
	the management code and hooks to let you usefully do this.
	Since DGD does far more in LPC than most drivers, this lets
	you reconfigure anything about your game nearly instantly, and
	run your development servers on the same LPC data without an
	interruption for days, months or years.
      </li>
      <li>
	DGD allows you to dump all game state in one lump, and
	reload that statedump with a new DGD version.  To upgrade
	DGD, just dump state, upgrade DGD and restart.  All your
	objects, files and players are exactly where they were.
	Only your current network connections are lost, and absolutely
	everything about DGD can be upgraded this way.
      </li>
      <li>
	DGD's dialect of LPC includes a lot of new extensions for
	better typechecking and error checking.  It removes several
	redundant and insecure features (like shadows) that can
	prevent a library from being securable.
      </li>

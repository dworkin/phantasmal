    <h1> Why Use DGD? </h1>

    <font size="4">

    <p>There are many good reasons to use DGD if you're building a MUD,
      and a surprising number even if you're building some other kind of
      networked server.  For now, I'm just going to give a few bullet
      points about what makes DGD as good as it is, and let Skotos
      Tech and the page of definitions do the explaining for me.</p>

    <p>Incidentally, if you already know you want an LPMUD it's worth
      glancing at the &quot;MudOS versus DGD&quot; discussion from the
      DGD mailing list linked below.</p>

    <h2>DGD is an amazing server:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because it's persistent.  That doesn't just mean that the game
	world persists or that you can save and restore.  For DGD, that
	means that the LPC objects can be dumped to a state file on
	shutdown and reloaded at startup without saving, messing around,
	or missing a beat.</li>
      <li>Because it does what's necessary to be persistent, such as
	allowing you to recompile every LPC object in place without
	rebooting or losing data.  You can even do it incrementally without
	stopping what you're doing.  New object data shows up and
	old data disappears quietly and transparently. </li>
      <li>Because it's clean and well-designed.  Dworkin works hard at making
	DGD the slimmest, slickest, leanest LPMUD out there and
	DGD's LPC dialect really shows it.  So does its exported set of
	kernel functions.  DGD resembles an Operating System or a language
	environment (which it is) much more than a MUD server.</li>
      <li>Because Dworkin works hard.  New features and bug fixes are added
	all the time, especially if you track the experimental version
	of DGD.  You see stuff that other MUD servers don't have
	and won't have any time soon like atomic functions with full
	rollback.</li>
    </ul>

      If you're just getting into DGD, you'll want to know some
      things.  First, you'll need a MUDLib to go with your DGD server.
      If you don't know what that is, you should definitely read the
      <a href="http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud-faq.htm"> LPMUD
      Frequently Asked Questions </a>.  And if you don't know what a
      MUDLib is, you should probably make sure you have plenty of
      other MUD experience or lots of documentation.  DGD is an
      incredible driver with a lot of good features, but it currently
      has no good MUDLib for a beginner to use.  You're going to be
      doing a lot of programming before this is all over.

    <p>
      Don't bother with the add-ons unless you know you specifically
      need one or another.  What you mostly want is the DGD server
      itself.  Consult your MUDLib documentation to determine what
      version of DGD you're likely to need.  If you're writing a new
      MUDLib from scratch, get the most recent experimental version
      of DGD.  They're all pretty stable.

    <h2> Tools for working on DGD </h2>

    <h3> Tools on Unix </h3>
    <p> Chances are you've already got what you need.  You'll need a good
      C compiler.  GCC is perfect.  You'll need a text editor that respects
      Unix-style line breaks, like emacs, vi, or pretty much any other
      normal Unix editor. </p>

    <h3> Tools on Windows </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
	For utilities like grep and patch the
	<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/"> Cygnus Cygwin
	  tools</a> are excellent.  You'll definitely want them if you're
	using the experimental branch of DGD even if you compile with
	Visual C++ or another non-GNU compiler.  They also come with a
	Windows version of GCC, which may be worth considering.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a href="http://www.textpad.com">Textpad</a> is supposed to be
	a fine editor, and it has the advantage that it'll handle DGD
	and unix-style line breaks correctly.  If you use J. Random Editor
	on Windows you'll probably find that the file just doesn't compile.
	Textpad fixes that problem.
      </li>
      <li>
	If you're using CVS to get <i>really</i> experimental versions
	of software you use with DGD (for instance, the
	<a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">Phantasmal</a>
	MUDLib), you should also be aware that the native Win32 version
	of CVS may cause problems with line endings (newlines).  If
	you have troubles with the CVS versions of the software but
	not the regular distributions, consider using the Cygwin
	CVS client instead of the Win32 native client. </li>

      <li>In addition, for TortoiseCVS, there's a <a
	  href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=25888&group_id=1">

    <h2> Making an Experimental Version of DGD </h2>

    <p>To patch up to an experimental version of DGD, say one of
      the 1.2.X series, first you'll need to <a href="#DGDPackages">
	get DGD </a>.  The latest version is definitely best if you're
      going to patch up to an experimental version, unless you need
      some very specific older version like 1.1.96.  You'll also
      need to download the whole set of
      <a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/experimental">
	experimental patches </a> from the version of the code you
      <i>have</i> up to the version you <i>want</i>.  Then, if
      you've got Unix and patch, or if you've got the
      <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/"> Cygnus Cygwin
	tools </a> under Windows (they also supply the patch
      utility) you'll want to type in a whole lot of lines like
      the ones below.  When you type them you should be in the
      same directory where you first untarred or unzipped the DGD
      source: </p>
    <pre>
patch -p 0 < 1.2-1.2.1
patch -p 0 < 1.2.1-1.2.2
patch -p 0 < 1.2.2-1.2.3
patch -p 0 < 1.2.3-1.2.4
patch -p 0 < 1.2.4-1.2.5
      [...]
patch -p 0 < 1.2.21-1.2.22
    </pre>
    <p>
    You'll need all those files on the right, the ones with
    names like &quot;1.2.1-1.2.2&quot;.  Be sure to unzip or
    ungzip them if they're compressed when you download them.
    Netscape may do this for you -- that's what's happened if
    you download 1.2.1-1.2.2.gz and Netscape offers to save it
    without the &quot;.gz&quot;.  Each one takes you up one
    experimental release, so to patch up to 1.2.22 above took 22
    patches from 1.2.  And this is all <i>before</i> you get
    around to building it.  Be sure to play with a stable
    version before you take the plunge the first time on the
    experimental one. </p>

    <p>Note that you'll need to do all of this patching
      <i>before</i> you build DGD to be sure everything works.  On
      the bright side, under Unix you may be able to avoid typing
      all those lines -- try just typing &quot;patch -p 0 < 1.2.*&quot;
      in a directory containing the unzipped patchfiles.  If you try
      it and it starts giving you rejected patches then something's
      wrong.  If that happens, you should go back to trying it the
      long (but certain) way. </p>

    <p>And a final note: if you're the sort that grabs the
      experimental version, you may be rebuilding from nothing, or
      you may be altering the lex/yacc files for some reason.  If
      you're using a nonstandard version of Yacc (for instance
      bison) you can type &quot;YACC=myyacc&quot; after the make
      command and it'll use the appropriate
      version.  For bison, you'll need to pass a command-line flag
      to make it output the appropriate filename.  For me, that
      command line winds up being &quot;make YACC='bison -o y.tab.c'&quot; </p>

    <h2> How do I set up DGD to work with ANSI color? </h2>

    <p>First, you should get and configure DGD without ANSI color.
      Make sure you have DGD working with your other options before
      worrying about color.  One option at a time is always your
      best bet.</p>

    <p>
      Once you have DGD working with all other patches you want to use
      (including the net package if you're planning to use it) you'll
      need to get and install the ANSI Color package.  Note that the
      ANSI color package isn't guaranteed to work with the net package
      -- keep reading anyway.  The 'patch' utility will do your dirty
      work for you if you can find an appropriate ANSI package for
      your DGD version.  Again, if you have the net package installed
      (or certain other nonstandard patches) then you'll have to
      hand-patch it.  To hand-patch, you'll need to look for lines like
      this: </p>
    <pre>
         } else if ((*p & 0x7f) < ' ' && *p != HT && *p != BEL && *p != BS) {
    </pre>
    <p>
      There'll be one or more in .../src/comm.c, so start looking
      there.  You'll need to change the &quot;0x7f&quot; in the line
      above to 0xff to let any high-ASCII characters through, or
      change the line in some other way to let only specific
      characters through.  Once you do that, all should be smooth
      sailing.  Incidentally, the there may be problems if you let
      <i>all</i> high-ASCII characters through, which is why DGD
      doesn't do it by default.  You may want to be more selective and
      just let the ones you care about through.  The best option is
      usually just to install the ANSI color package rather than
      mucking around in the source unless you already know what you're
      doing -- it'll let only the escape character (\033)
      through, which is all you need for ANSI color.
    </p>

    <p>
      To enable non-English character codes you'll need to hand-patch.
      You can either do the 0xff hack above or specifically let
      through the foreign character codes you plan to allow.  You'll
      need to find out their ASCII values or ranges and add them to
      the if statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you've got the net package installed, you'll need to
      search comm.net.c for the same line and replace it where it
      occurs in that file as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of DGD 1.2.41, there's another possibility if you're
      willing to play with telnet codes, or if you don't care about
      them.  Since you can now have as many telnet or binary ports
      as you feel like, you could just make your primary MUD port a
      <i>binary</i> port, it'll let all high-ASCII characters
      through, and you're still compatible with stock DGD rather
      than requiring patches.
    </p>

    <a name="StringSize"> </a>
    <h2> Compiling DGD with a larger maximum string size </h2>

    <p>By default the largest allowable string in DGD is 64kb.  If
      you need a larger string size you can increase it by
      recompiling the driver with a couple of modifications.</p>

    <p>In dgd/src/config.h, change the type of ssizet to Uint,
      #define SSIZET_MAX as UINT_MAX, and #define MAX_STRLEN as what
      you want the maximum string length to be.</p>

    <p>Old state dump files with a smaller ssizet type can be restored
      safely.</p>

    <hr />

    <a name="NumObjects"> </a>
    <h2> Compiling DGD with a larger maximum number of objects </h2>

    <p>Plain vanilla DGD has a maximum of 65536 objects at once.
      If you need more objects than that, you'll need to change a
      couple of things in the driver source.</p>

    <p>In dgd/src/config.h, you'll need &quot;typedef unsigned int
      uindex;&quot; and &quot;# define UINDEX_MAX UINT_MAX&quot; in
      place of the previous definitions of uindex and UINDEX_MAX.
      This type and constant define how DGD handles objects, so now
      you should be good up to potentially four billion objects.  If
      you need more than that, you should probably ask the mailing
      list.  Alternatively, you might notice that these are regular
      heavyweight objects -- LWOs don't count.  So if you're using a
      late-vintage 1.2.XX DGD and are willing to have the swapping
      behavior do some funky things, you can seriously cut down the
      number of objects by using LWOs. </p>

    <p>If you fix this and still can't get enough objects, you
      should check your .dgd file -- for instance,
      &quot;mud.dgd&quot; for the Kernel MUDLib which has all your
      configuration information.  You <i>did</i> increase the
      maximum number of objects to the new limit you want, yes?</p>

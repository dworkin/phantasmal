<h2>MudOS vs DGD</h2>

<p>This is taken straight from the DGD mailing list archives. Since
DGD continues its relatively rapid pace of development, and MudOS
seems to still be languishing, this is all likely to still be
accurate. And DGD, if anything, is gaining even further on MudOS. I
like to think my own library, Phantasmal, makes a difference in the
usual 'no available libraries' argument against DGD, but if you
don't like libraries based on the <a href="Kernel">Kernel
Library</a>, you won't like Phantasmal.</p>

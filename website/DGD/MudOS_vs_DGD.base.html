<h1>MudOS vs DGD</h1>

<p>This is taken straight from the DGD mailing list archives. Since DGD
continues its relatively rapid pace of development, and MudOS seems to
still be languishing, this is all likely to still be accurate. And DGD,
if anything, is gaining even further on MudOS. I like to think my own
library, Phantasmal, makes a difference in the usual 'no available
libraries' argument against DGD, but if you don't like libraries based
on the <a href="Kernel">Kernel Library</a>, you won't like
Phantasmal.</p>

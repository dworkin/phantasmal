DGD just runs LPC code. Clearly your LPC code tries to do more than
your machine can handle. Some suggestions for problem analysis,

 *) First, chart how CPU usage varies with users. If it's at 50% with
    no users on, then clearly background work is the culprit. If it's
    at 10% with no users on but 70% in the evening, then code executed
    as a direct result of player commands would be the place to look.

 *) If it's high in CPU, it's probably not limited by I/O or memory,
    which is a good thing. It suggests the slowness is due to running
    LPC code rather than, say, too low a swap fragment or worse, the
    machine swapping at the OS level.

 *) Technically less than completely trivial but very wortwhile is to
    get profiling data. For DGD this is currently done by precompiling
    the whole library (is there documentation on this process)? If you
    go this route, I heartily suggest using Dark's/Nino's EPP 2.1.

    The precompiler turns LPC into C code. Then, you compile it all in
    a profiling compiler (which measures how much time is spent in what
    functions) and analyse the result. Non-trivial but often useful.

    I've made stabs at an internal DGD profiler, but the version I put
    together is exceedingly limited. I may revisit this problem though
    as Skotos' games get larger and (even) more difficult to analyze.

 *) Enable and disable suspicious parts of the code. For example, if you
    have complex code that is run every time somebody moves through a
    room, try temporarily commenting out that code and see what happens
    to the load. You can do things like move east and then west 10,000
    times and see how long it takes on a totally unloaded (test) Mud.

 *) DGD has a tick counter. All LPC that is executed uses up ticks and
    you can limit that amount of ticks any thread had. You could slowly
    lower this limit until you start seeing 'out of ticks' errors in
    the driver log and stare carefully at the stack trace to figure out
    where in the mudlib that tends to occur.


Just a few common-sense suggestions.

Some notes on the relative speed of various functions.

The random() kfun uses either the BSD Unix C library function random(),
or the SYSV Unix C library function rand48().  I do not know which is
faster.  The randomness of either is considered to be inadequate by
many specialists, who like custom random functions for different
applications.  I expect that it is possible to implement a fast
pseudo-random number generator in LPC.  Also note that unless you know
the order in which users send their input to the server, you'll have
an extra source of randomness there which affects the order in which
calls to your pseudo-random number generator are made.

All LPC floating point numbers are currently simulated without using
floats in C.  This is of course slower than using floats, but not as
much slower as you would expect.  Also take into account that DGD
floats do not exactly match IEEE floats or doubles; they have 11
bits in the exponent and 36 in the mantissa.  A future version of
DGD is likely to use native floats.

Many of those who worry about the speed of LPC start with adding
new kfuns to DGD first.  This is doing things backwards.  LPC is
a decent programming language, so first implement your mudlib in
LPC, then optimize, then precompile, and <then> rewrite parts of
your code in C.  Chances are that the code you eventually decide
to write a kfun for, if any, is completely different from the
code that you originally had doubts about.

Finally, on how to time the performance of a function in LPC:
either go by ticks measurement, or let it do a few hundred
thousand or million iterations so that the time spent can be
measured in seconds, and then observe the actual time spent on
an unloaded system.

Dworkin

Hello,

About 2-3 months ago the Castle Marrach game at Skotos
(www.skotos.net) broke the 2GB barrier, with its statedump currently
at 525394 sectors of 4k each:

    > code 525394 * 4 * 1024
    $40 = -2142953472

:-)

Are there any other big DGD-using games out there, or does that make
it the biggest DGD-based game in existence?

Cheers,

Erwin.
P.S: Good to see the list back up and running. :)

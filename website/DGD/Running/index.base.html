<p>None of the issues of running a MUD is really unique to DGD, though
DGD may alter some of those issues somewhat. You'll find that some of
these issues are impacted significantly by whether you're running a

though.</p>

<p>Mostly, these topics are included here because they've come up on the
DGD mailing list before, and I'd like the content to be archived
somewhere. It's nice to get the benefits of other people's perspective
and all that.</p>

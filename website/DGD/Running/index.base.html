  <h2> Running a MUD </h2>

  <p>
    None of the issues of running a MUD is really unique to DGD,
    though DGD may alter some of those issues somewhat.  You'll find
    that some of these issues are impacted significantly by whether
    you're running a <a
    href="../GameDesign/GamePersistence.html">persistent MUD</a>,
    though.

  <p>
    Mostly, these topics are included here because they've come up on
    the DGD mailing list before, and I'd like the content to be
    archived somewhere.  It's nice to get the benefits of other
    people's perspective and all that.

<p>None of the issues of running a MUD is really unique to DGD,
though DGD may alter some of those issues somewhat. You'll find
that some of these issues are impacted significantly by whether
you're running a <a href=
"../GameDesign/GamePersistence.html">persistent MUD</a>,
though.</p>

<p>Mostly, these topics are included here because they've come up
on the DGD mailing list before, and I'd like the content to be
archived somewhere. It's nice to get the benefits of other people's
perspective and all that.</p>

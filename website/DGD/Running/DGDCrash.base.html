  <h2> When Might DGD Legitimately Crash? </h2>

  <p>
    There are actually several times that DGD might crash, hang, or
    otherwise get into an unusable state.
  </p>

  <p>
    The simplest times are when you tell it to - if you set the tick
    limit to -1 and then get into an infinite loop, for instance,
    that'll do it.  Similarly, if you block input and then never turn
    it back on, your MUD will be pretty thoroughly unusable.
  </p>

  <p>
    DGD is a lot more prone to crash if you have serious problems when
    you're starting up - if your code doesn't compile originally, for
    instance, or if you have an uncaught fatal error when initializing
    your very first object.  'Crash' is perhaps too strong a word, but
    it will cease running.  You can also get a crash in certain
    circumstances if you do something funny enough with your error
    handling.  If your handler for runtime_error gets a runtime error
    immediately, for instance, you're pretty screwed and DGD will tend
    to give up and die.
  </p>

  <p>
    DGD can also crash if a guest programmer allocates all free
    memory.  There isn't really a good way around this.  If you're
    allowing guest programmers full LPC access, they can allocate all
    your RAM and bring your MUD to its knees.  Some libs, like LPMOO,
    get around this by allowing guest programming in a language
    *other* than LPC so there are some restrictions on this.

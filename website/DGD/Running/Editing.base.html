At what level are you trying to implement pico as your editor?

I once thought about doing this sort of thing (using vi, not pico) and 
realised that its not possible because mud connections are in sending a 
a text stream, and unless they have a pico editor locally installed and 
pico has some way of interacting with a text stream then its not 
possible. Ed on the other hand is simply a read and put text interface.

Saying this I suppose it would be possible to incorporate pico into the 
mud because you can run other ncursers programs through telnet 
connections (eg midnight commander), but I would suppose there countless 
  problems with this due timing issues and such (someone with ncursers 
experience might be more help here)

The basic conclusion was that without hacking into vi or pico and 
integrating a mud client into it that reads the file and creates a local 
copy to edit it wasn't possible. The best solution in that sense is to 
use tf (or the like) to silently read the file into a local copy, launch 
pico to edit it in another window, and then have another macro to send 
it back... or my preferred option is to use emacs and implement a ftp 
connection to the mud.

The normal mud telnet connection is a linemode telnet, which works for 
ed. To use pico, vi, or any similar program through telnet you would 
need to use a character-mode connection, which is possible via the 
binary port. I think this has been discussed before, look in the 
archives...

Using the actual pico editor would require a lot of DGD hacking.  First,
you'd have to extend the subset of the telnet protocol implemented by
DGD to allow character mode and a host of other things -- probably
everything in the telnet standard.  Then, DGD must be made to execute
pico, piping input and output through the telnet front end for the
duration of the pico process.

It is certainly possible to do all of that, but it is, shall we say,
a non-trivial amount of work.

Here is an editor quick reference page I wrote for a mud I used to
work on, and which I made available using the 'h' command.

Subject: [DGD] Offline Editing & TF

This is more an FYI since I've seen the editing question pop up so much in
the Archives for the last 3 years (haven't gotten through the ones I
downloaded via ftp yet -- the web ones are so much easier to peruse :)

But this is something that we've been using so far, since the other Admin is
hosting it locally on his machine, and I as frequently edit offline as in a
shell acct on the machine, or in ed on the mud itself.

Anyways, a functionality that TinyFugue has is the /quote command.
One thing you should be aware of is that any line beginning with "/" in
default TF will be considered a TinyFugue command. But there is a way to
override this. I have successfully used "/quote" to upload files > 20KB thus
far. While connected to the mud, I start an editor up "ed" then "a"
/quote /send '<directorylocaltoTinyFugue>/fileName

In my instance the dir TF is usally in would be ~/tf-dir/, so if I am
uploading from say ~/tf-dir/mudcode
I would do: /quote /send 'mudcode/somefile.c
(btw the "/send" is what negates TF from trying to use a line starting with
"/" as a TF command.)

what I also do is put a "." as the first char on the last line of the file
and a "w" then a "q"
so when the transmission is ended it writes out the file and quits the ed.
The other thing to note is /set ptime 0 ... else every "line" of the file
being transmitted will take 1 second ;)

Anyways, I know not if this is helpful to anyone but TF is also available as
a WinBlows precompile www.druware.com/downloads/  -- for anyone that doesn't
want to compile in Cygwin.

Sorry for the non-DGD-related spam...just seemed to relate to a lot of the
embedding editor and ftp/etc queries that people have asked over the years.

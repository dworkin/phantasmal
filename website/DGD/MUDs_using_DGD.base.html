    <h1> What MUDs Use DGD? </h1>

    <p> You can find most of these DGD MUDs
      the same way I did -- go to
      <a href="http://www.mudconnect.com">the MUDConnector</a> and search
      the MUDs on the keyphrase &quot;DGD&quot;.  Here's what I found
      when I did that search.</p>

    <h3> Skotos Games </h3>

    <p>Skotos games give one free trial month and are flat-rate per
      month afterward.  One account gives access to the major Skotos
      games including (non-DGD-based) The Eternal City and Grendel's
      Revenge, and a variety of web games whose implementations I know
      nothing about.  My understanding is that standard MUD clients
      work for Castle Marrach, but that you're far better off using
      the Java or ActiveX clients.  For details, you should have a
      look at <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos'</a> web page. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach">Castle Marrach</a>
	is the first Skotos game and features large amounts of role-playing
	and little or no killin' stuff. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://welcome.skotos.net">Welcome Room</a> is an
	out-of-character chat theatre. </li>
    </ul>

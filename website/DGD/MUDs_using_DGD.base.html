<h2>What MUDs Use DGD?</h2>

<p>You can find most of these DGD MUDs the same way I did -- go to
<a href="http://www.mudconnect.com">the MUDConnector</a> and search
the MUDs on the keyphrase "DGD". Here's what I found when I did
that search.</p>

<h3>Skotos Games</h3>

<p>Skotos games give one free trial month and are flat-rate per
month afterward. One account gives access to the major Skotos games
including (non-DGD-based) The Eternal City and Grendel's Revenge,
and a variety of web games whose implementations I know nothing
about. My understanding is that standard MUD clients work for
Castle Marrach, but that you're far better off using the Java or
ActiveX clients. For details, you should have a look at <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos'</a> web page.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach">Castle
  Marrach</a> is the first Skotos game and features large amounts
  of role-playing and little or no killin' stuff.</li>

  <li><a href="http://welcome.skotos.net">Welcome Room</a> is an
  out-of-character chat theatre.</li>
</ul>

    <h3 align="center"> Giving Back to the DGD Community </h3>

    <p>
      The DGD community is trying to give you a good time, as a
      programmer or as a player.  That's what we're here for.  That's
      what I do, what Skotos does, what everybody starting a MUD is
      trying to do.  You may want to give back to the community in
      some way.  You can give more of the same benefits that you most
      enjoyed, or however you're best able to contribute.  This page
      is full of suggestions for things the community could benefit
      from, and would enjoy.
    </p>

    <h3> Programming </h3>

    <p>
      Build a new MUDLib for DGD.  Every one helps.  Or contribute to
      an existing one.  Melville hasn't been updated in ages.  We
      don't have a DGD-ized Lima version.  Phantasmal can always use
      the help.  There are plenty of new MUDLibs that haven't taken
      off yet like Aexeon and The Last Bastion.  Go out and contribute
      to a MUDLib, or start your own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Write a subsystem that other people can easily use.  The
      Phantasmal UNQ system and Help system have both been used by
      other MUD libraries.  They're designed to be simple and modular
      so you can easily use them.  If you write something like that,
      people will use it, and MUDLibs may adopt it.  And hey, it's
      another code example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along the same lines as the above, here are some things people have
      been talking about doing for awhile, but aren't freely available...
      <ul>
        <li> A passive FTP daemon would be wonderful.  We need one. </li>
	<li> A better telnet terminal for binary sockets.  This'll let
	  you do color without having to modify DGD. </li>
	<li> An IMUD3 daemon.  That requires a modified DGD, or writing
	  an external daemon that also connects to your MUD server. </li>
	<li> An integrated HTTP/web server </li>
	<li> A really good English parser </li>
      </ul>
      Write one of these and everybody will thank you.  Many people
      will use it.  And I'll probably integrate it into Phantasmal, if
      it's in the public domain.
    </p>

    <h3> Writing </h3>

    <p>
      Make some documentation.  LPC needs documentation.  All existing
      MUDLibs do.  DGD certainly does.  Pick something and write
      documentation.  The most valuable documentation at this point is
      probably &quot;how to code&quot; documentation and &quot;how to
      set up a new MUD&quot;.  But if you've had problems getting
      started, write up your experiences and how you solved your
      problems.  Chances are good that somebody else will have the
      same problems later on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Build a MUD area.  Write new rooms, objects and creatures for
      one MUDLib or another.  Stock areas may get routinely
      badmouthed, but they also get <i>used</i>, and people can
      actually <i>play</i> them.  Make sure to license your areas so
      that people can easily modify them.  That way people won't
      instantly know the solution every time they walk into a place
      that uses your area, and they can enjoy your puzzles (and new
      puzzles added by others!) all the more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Put together a web site.  Do a fan site for an existing DGD MUD.
      Make a forum for new MUD administrators to share triumphs and
      frustrations.  Do a documentation site or a set of open forums,
      or some other way to build community.  While we're not hurting
      for these the way we're hurting for most other stuff on this
      page, every little bit helps.
    </p>

    <h3> Filthy Lucre </h3>

    <p>
      Get a Skotos account, and maybe a premium one.  Skotos pays for
      a DGD commercial license, and those licenses aren't cheap.  Pay
      Skotos and Skotos will stay afloat.  And that keeps Dworkin
      eating, which keeps him maintaining DGD.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you work for a large company, propose doing a project on top
      of DGD.  Yahoo Chat works this way, and pays for another
      commercial DGD license.  If you're doing something high-volume
      that needs to be robust, DGD will save you a *lot* of time and
      money -- it's worth the license, and it helps the DGD community
      out.  The more companies that use DGD, the more time and effort
      Dworkin can spend on keeping it going.  If it gets popular
      enough, all those companies will want lots of new features.  And
      new features benefit you and me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many SourceForge projects take donations.  My own project,
      Phantasmal, doesn't, but you may find some worthy recipient that
      will.  I can't really recommend this option since it's rarely
      money that's holding back opensource projects.  But just
      contributing money <i>is</i> an option.  So if you just want to
      settle your feeling of debt to the DGD community, you can
      certainly do it.

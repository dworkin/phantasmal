    <h3> LPC Documentation </h3>

    <p> Note:  None of the documentation in this section is designed
      specifically for DGD so expect some differences between the
      listed sources and how DGD really works! </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="../external/Basic_LPC.html">
	  Descartes of Borg's (in)famous LPC tutorial. </a></li>
      <li> Jehuda's
	<a href="http://www.geocities.com/homemud/Textbooks-e.html">
	  Page of LPC Tutorials</a> has a lot of places to learn LPC. </li>
      <li> I've gotten a good start on adapting Ronny Wikh's
	<a href="http://www.sneakers.org/lpmud/www.neosoft.com/genesis/lpc_toc.html">
	  LPC Textbook</a>.  It was one
	of the best available sources for learning LPC.  I now believe that
	my <a href="../LPC/">DGD adaptation</a> is a better way to learn
	and a better reference, at least if you're using DGD. </li>
      <li> The
	<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/nanny/docs/manual/manual.html">
	  NannyMUD LPC Manual</a> is about an older dialect of LPC. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This page and its sub-pages are all about DGD's version of LPC.
      If you're using MudOS, LDMUD, Amylaar or any other flavor of
      LPMUD then don't expect all of this to be true.  Similarly, if
      you read LPC documents elsewhere on the web, some of it won't
      work on DGD.  That's especially true of game-specific code since
      that usually assumes there are a lot of built-in functions that
      DGD doesn't provide.</p>

    <p>A lot of this page is taken from the mailing list and from
      Dworkin.  Some is taken from Dworkin and not credited to him at
      the actual location.  If somebody wants to complain, I'll go
      through and add attribution to him at each individual location
      in the file.  Otherwise I'll do what I'm doing now and you
      should assume that anything really useful in the file is by him
      and anything that isn't, or that's wrong, was added by me.  To
      be sure about one thing or another, check the mailing list
      archives. </p>

Pretty smooth, but unfortunately this takes quadratic time. For a 
one-thousand word string, you'd end up looping over hundreds of 
thousands of array elements (you loop N times in LPC and the union 
operator has to loop over an array of size N => N^2).

Perhaps something like:

{
   mapping set;
   string *words;
   int i;

   set = ([ ]);
   keys = explode(str, " ");

   for (i = 0; i < sizeof(keys); i ++) {
     if (keys[i] == "" || !set[keys[i]]) {
       set[keys[i]] = TRUE;
       keys[i] = nil;
   }
   return keys - ({ nil });
}

(note: not tested)

Oh, but it does:

    ({ 1, 2, 3 })[0 .. -1] == ({ })

So the two special cases are [0 .. 0-1] and [size .. size-1], and the
general case is [x .. x-1] == ({ }), for 0 <= x <= size.  To be
consistent with normal ranges, xxx[-1 .. 0] would have to be an array
of <two> elements, if it worked at all.

I'm sorry that you think this is kludgy.  Personally, I think that
returning ({ }) for any invalid range is dangerous, <unless> ({ }) and
([ ]) were somehow equivalent with nil -- which is something that many
have requested for the sake of convenience, but actually, LPC is a more
expressive language with that distinction.

A & B: A - (A - B)
A | B: A + (B - A)
A ^ B: (A - B) + (B - A)

The driver doesn't do anything extraordinary.  It is only faster because
it works at a level below LPC.

A | B is not array concatenation, see above.  By the way, you can
use &=, |= and ^= on arrays, too.

No, the only operation on an array that modifies it without creating
a new array is arr[i] = val.

DGD handles timing for integer-delay callouts using the POSIX time.
That means that a one-second callout started at time T will be executed
(the rest of the MUD allowing) when the time turns into T+1, measured
in POSIX seconds since 1970.  So the actual delay can be between 0 and 1
seconds, and that's ignoring delays due to other callouts trying to
run at that same moment.

For callouts with a floating point delay, more care is taken that they
run precisely at the intended moment.  A 1.0 delay callout started at
T + 0.23 will be executed at T + 1.23.

This may legitimately (appear to) happen if each one second callout takes
.95 seconds to process.  Perhaps the laptop is fairly old, and a lot
slower than the desktop machine?  Otherwise, this may be a bug in DGD
which I would like to learn more about.

As soon as possible after the current thread ends.  Having it execute
_during_ this loop of execution (thread) would make it a call_other()
effectively, which wouldn't be very useful.

The only thing that could cause the 0-call_out not to be execute
right after the current thread is if there are other 0-callouts
waiting to be executed.

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

All call_out()s started in object A are removed from the system
automatically when object A is destroyed.

The 5 second callout might execute after the first zero second callout
and before the second one.

If you want to be certain that the chain of zero second callouts comes
first, start the 5 second callout from the last one.

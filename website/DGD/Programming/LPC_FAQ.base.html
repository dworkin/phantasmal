<h2>Function and Variable Modifiers</h2>

<p>Note: these are properly called function or variable <i>classes</i>

<a name="Inheritance" id="Inheritance"></a>

<h2>How does inheritance work in DGD's LPC?</h2>

<p>Basic inheritance is pretty simple. Conceptually if one program
inherits from another it means the one inheriting "is" the thing it
inherits from. That's why inheritance is often referred to as an "is-a"
relationship. Anyway, how you <i>think</i> of it is your own
business.</p>

<p>If program B inherits from program A, then B can call all of A's
non-private functions without having to do a call_other. It also gets
the ability to refer to all of A's non-private variables, which it gets
copies of. It gets those copies because B contains a complete object of
type A inside of it, and can refer to it as though B were just another
part of A except for private functions and variables. A gets no special
privileges on B, only the other way around.</p>

<p>Note that all function calls are virtual in DGD, except perhaps
nomask (which could be virtual, but it wouldn't matter anyway). That
means that even if you don't explicitly use call_out syntax, the
function call will potentially go to any child class that may have
overridden it. If you need to be 100% sure that no child class has
overridden a function, you probably need to use nomask, and possibly
private, in its declaration.</p>

<p>Note that all DGD inheritance is the equivalent of C++ virtual
inheritance. This means that even if you have a diamond-shaped
inheritance graph. For instance, say class A inherits class B and C, and
both B and C inherit from D. Class A only gets a single copy of D's data
members, not one for B and one for C. If you need a class to get its own
copy of another class, one that nobody else can modify even through
inheritance, then you should probably have that class allocate a new
instance of the one it wants to control instead of inheriting from it.
That way you're getting containment instead of inheritance.</p>

<p>Since B "is" an A, people outside B can call A's functions in B just
like they could in A. Usually that's the point but if you don't want
that in a particular instance then you can use private inheritance to
avoid it. If you say</p>
<pre>
private inherit "/usr/System/obj/A";
    </pre>

<p>instead of</p>
<pre>
inherit "/usr/System/obj/A";
    </pre>

<p>then nobody outside B, including B's children, can call A's
functions. Even if they were normal before, within B they're static. If
B were to also inherit A publically, either directly or through a parent
class, that would override the private inheritance.</p>

<p>The other cute trick that inheritance can do is to use namespaces.
Instead of the inherit line above, B could say</p>
<pre>
inherit foo "/usr/System/obj/A";
    </pre>

<p>This would still let B call all of A's functions, but instead of
calling them like this:</p>
<pre>
inherited_A_func("bob", "spam");
    </pre>

<p>they'd be called like this:</p>
<pre>
foo::inherited_A_func("bob", "spam");
    </pre>

<p>Nifty, yeah? The two tricks can be combined, like this:</p>
<pre>
private inherited foo "/usr/System/obj/A";
    </pre>

<p>For more about one more complicated take on inheritance and how it
should work in DGD, see the <a href="../Kernel/Inheritance.html">Kernel
Library</a> inheritance docs.</p>

<h2>LPC Array and Mapping Operations</h2>

<p>LPC has two nifty types that C doesn't really have: array and
mapping. While C <i>does</i> have an array type, LPC's version is much
niftier for MUD coding.</p>

<p>The mapping (hash table) type is called, simply enough, mapping.
Assigning it can look like this:</p>
<pre>
mapping dinner_schedule;
dinner_schedule = ([ "Monday" : "Meatloaf",
                     "Tuesday" : "Chicken",
                     "Wednesday" : "Tater tots",
                     "Thursday" : "Fish",
                     "Friday" : "Leftovers",
                   ]);
    </pre>

<p>That comma on the last line is optional, like in Perl. To query the
mapping, you'd say something like:</p>
<pre>
message("My dinner on Tuesday is " + dinner_schedule["Tuesday"] + "\n");
    </pre>

<p>To add an element to the mapping, you'd assign a value to it. For
instance:</p>
<pre>
dinner_schedule["Saturday"] = "Prime Rib";


    </pre>

<p>To remove an element from the mapping, you can assign nil to it. For
instance:</p>
<pre>
dinner_schedule["Wednesday"] = nil;  /* No dinner on Wednesday!  :( */
    </pre>

<p>You can also subtract an array of indices from a mapping to remove
those elements, so another way to do the same thing as above would
be:</p>
<pre>
dinner_schedule -= ({"Wednesday"});


    </pre>

<p>To shallow-copy an array or mapping, the following code from the
Melville MUDLib should work:</p>
<pre>
nomask mixed copy (mixed a) {
    mixed b ;
    if (typeof(a)==T_ARRAY || typeof(a)==T_MAPPING) {
        b = a[..] ;
    } else {
        b = a ;
    }
    return b ;
}
    </pre>

<p>Note that a "shallow copy" just means a one-level copy. The elements
of the mapping are copied, but if they point to something like an
object, then both copies still point to the same object.</p>

<p>Although Melville chooses not to, you could also iterate through the
array or mapping and copy every element with the copy() routine above,
which would give a full deep-copy. The recursive copy routine would also
die on circular data structures but luckily for me deep-copying circular
data structures is beyond the scope of this document. Look it up
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The copy operation above, incidentally, is a great example of
array-slice notation, much like in Perl. The notation</p>
<pre>
b = a[..];
    </pre>

<p>means to copy the whole array. The notation</p>
<pre>
b = a[1..4];
    </pre>

<p>would copy only the second through fifth array elements.</p>

<a name="StringOps" id="StringOps"></a>

<h2>LPC String Operations</h2>

<p>LPC has an integrated string type, but no character type. This is a
little confusing if you're coming from a C background. You can still
dereference a string with array syntax, it just returns an integer which
happens to be between 0 and 255. You can assign a value to the
array-dereference of a string, which assigns that character of the
string that ASCII code, approximately like C.</p>

<p>If you're looking for the equivalent operation to "if(mystring[0] ==
'a')", I prefer to use "if(mystring[0] == "a"[0])". It's not perfect,
but I don't know a better way of getting a character value in DGD in a
fast, transparent way.</p>
<hr />
<a name="Varargs" id="Varargs"></a>

<h2>LPC Varargs and "..." functions</h2>

<p>There are two ways in LPC to call functions with a variable number of
arguments. The modern and recommended way is the <b>varargs</b> keyword.
The older way is the <b>...</b> operator.</p>

<p>The <b>varargs</b> keyword is put into the function declaration, like
this:</p>
<pre>
int print_one_or_two_numbers(int first, varargs int second);
    </pre>

<p>This will allow the function to take one or two arguments. The extra
argument, if not supplied, defaults to the same value that an
uninitialized field would. For an integer that means the value defaults
to zero. The function above may be called as
"print_one_or_two_numbers(7,3);" or "print_one_or_two_numbers(8);". If
there are multiple varargs arguments, simply put the varargs keyword
once, before the first varargs argument. For instance:</p>
<pre>
int print_two_to_five_numbers(int first, int second, varargs int third,
                              int fourth, int fifth);
    </pre>

<p>This function may be called with between two and five integers, as
the name suggests. You can't, for instance, call it and supply a
"fourth" argument but not a "third" argument. The arguments are used in
the order supplied.</p>

<p>The <b>...</b> operator is really two operators. It's one operator
when you're specifying a function and another when you're calling a
function. The first is used more frequently, but the second is necessary
if you're going to pass a variable number of arguments to another
varargs-type function.</p>

<p>When you define a varargs function with <b>...</b>, the final
argument will silently become an array. For instance:</p>
<pre>
void print_some_stuff(string format, mixed stuff_to_print...);
    </pre>

<p>Though you declared it <b>mixed</b>, stuff_to_print is actually a
<b>mixed *</b>. If you'd declared it <b>int</b>, it would have become an
<b>int *</b>. If the function is called as "print_some_stuff("Bob: %num
%num %string", 7, 15, "sam")" then <i>format</i> will be "Bob: %num %num
%string" and <i>stuff_to_print</i> will be ({ 7, 15, "sam" }). Pretty
simple. If the type of your final argument isn't <i>mixed</i> then you
won't be able to supply multiple types of varargs arguments.</p>

<p>So what if you want to use those varargs arguments to call another
varargs function? In C you use a structure and call the new function in
a funky way, but LPC has no such structure, nor the library or function
call that C uses. Instead, it has the rather ingenious <b>...</b>
operator's other variant, the one you use on a function call.</p>

<p>To use it, the final argument of your function call should be an
array. For instance, if <b>print_some_stuff</b> used another function
underneath to do the real work, the body of it might be:</p>
<pre>
void print_some_stuff(string format, mixed stuff)
{
    "/usr/leetboy/obj/myprint"-&gt;myprint(format, stuff...);
}
    </pre>

<p>The call to <i>myprint</i> above would expand into a call like the
original one -- one with four arguments in the example above. So the
array is expanded back into the individual arguments.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Differences Between LPC and C</h2>

<h3>Floating-point Differences</h3>

<p>There are no explicit double-precision floating point numbers in LPC.
The driver is compiled one way or the other and you use whichever it
chooses. Either way, the type is called "float".</p>

<p>LPC is less prone to automatically upcast an int to a float than C
is. That means you can't just compare an int to a float with less-than,
you have to use a float on both sides or typecast. You also can't just
pass an int to a function that expects a float as a parameter for the
same reason.</p>

<p>LPC follows the normal human float-rounding convention of rounding
things higher than 0.50 up to the next highest integer and lower than
0.50 down to the next lowest one instead of the C convention of always
truncating toward zero. It takes some getting used to.</p>

<h3>Other Differences</h3>

<p>In LPC you can't do the C-style "declare and initialize" with both of
those things on one line. For instance, this:</p>
<pre>
mapping dinner_schedule = ([ ]);
    </pre>

<p>should instead be this:</p>
<pre>
mapping dinner_schedule;
dinner_schedule = ([ ]);
    </pre>

<p>Unlike C, LPC doesn't have a proper "char" type. Instead, it just
uses integers. This can cause some slightly oddities, but it's basically
the same. One trick to remember: even though <i>you</i> may know that
that int is acting as a char, if you concatenate it onto a string it
still shows up as a number. Many traditional C-style loops where you go
through and do something for every character, or build a string by
concatenating the characters of another string in order, are a little
different as a result of this.</p>
<hr />
<a name="ErrCatch" id="ErrCatch"></a>

<h2>Catching Errors in LPC Code</h2>

<p>In some cases you know that a chunk of LPC code may cause an error,
and if so then you'd like to catch the error, possibly examine the
return value and do some cleanup. LPC can help you. Here's a bit of code
from the Kernel MUDLib's "/lib/wiztool.c":</p>
<pre>
    err = catch(result = ::read_file(path, offset, size));
    if (err) {
        message(path + ": " + err + ".\n");
        return -1;
    }
    </pre>

<p>The <b>message</b> and <b>read_file</b> functions do about what you'd
expect. The interesting bit is the <b>catch</b> statement. Note the
parentheses (<i>not</i> curly-braces) around the expression following
the <b>catch</b> keyword. If <b>read_file</b> causes an error during its
operation, the <b>catch</b> will intercept it and return its error
message as a string. The <b>catch</b> will return nil if no error occurs
on the <b>read_file</b>. Nifty!</p>

<p>There's a second form of the <b>catch</b> statement with similar but
subtly different functionality. We'll have a look at another Kernel
MUDLib example, this one from "/kernel/lib/port.c". You'll see that it
uses the alternate <b>catch</b> construct twice, one inside the
other.</p>
<pre>
        catch {
            ::open_port(protocol, port);
            porttype = (protocol == "telnet") ? "telnet" : "binary";
            if (protocol == "tcp" &amp;&amp; udp) {
                udpport = clone_object(PORT_UDP);
                catch {
                    udpport-&gt;listen(port);
                } : {
                    destruct_object(udpport);
                    return 0;
                }
            }
            return 1;
        } : {
            return 0;
        }
    </pre>

<p>Note the curly-braces following the <b>catch</b> statement, and the
colon and additional block following the first block. Notice also that
this statement doesn't attempt to extract the error string associated
with the error -- that's more important than it looks.</p>

<p>So how's this one different? There's the obvious, the fact that it
lets you execute a block of code if an error occurs. That's the "return
0" of the outer loop or the " destruct_object(udpport); return 0; " of
the inner loop. There's the fact that it uses curly-braces rather than
parentheses, of course. There's also the fact that this version,
<i>unlike the other</i>, will call your error manager. It supplies the
<b>caught</b> flag so that you'll know it's being intercepted rather
than causing an error that just kills the thread.</p>

<p>Another difference is that there's no obvious way to get the error
string in the second version. The Kernel MUDLib does so in a couple of
places since it gets passed as a parameter. When it does, the result
looks like this:</p>
<pre>
            catch {
                rlimits (-1; -1) {
                    if (!rsrcd-&gt;rsrc_incr(oowner, "events", obj, 1)) {
                        error("Too many events");
                    }
                    events[name] = objlist;
                }
            } : error(::call_trace()[1][TRACE_FIRSTARG][1]);
    </pre>

<p>Pretty ugly. But hey, it works... You may have trouble with using
this exact syntax for older versions of DGD, as well. Bear in mind that
you're technically pulling a random piece out of the call stack, which
can be <i>interesting</i> if you do it wrong...</p>

<p>As a last note, you'll need to make sure you include the correct
header to use the call_trace and TRACE_FIRSTARG you see above. That
header is &lt;trace.h&gt;.</p>
<hr />
<a name="NilOps" id="NilOps"></a>

<h2>What's nil? How does DGD use it?</h2>

<p>If you check the DGD mailing list in roughly the March 1999
timeframe, a lot of discussion of this went on. To get the information
from the original source, that's the place to look.</p>

<p>nil is DGD's false or uninitialized value. Many other LPMUDs use the
integer 0 for this value, and DGD used to do so. These days when you
have an uninitialized or destroyed object (or in many cases unallocated
memory), you'll find nil instead of integer 0. nil and 0 are the same
thing at lower type-checking levels (levels 0 and 1) which still work
the way DGD did long ago, nil-wise.</p>

<p>nil happens in a lot of places. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The kfun <b>allocate</b> allocates an array of nil values.</li>

  <li>String, object, array and mapping variables are initialized to
  nil.</li>

  <li>call_other on a nonexistent function returns nil.</li>

  <li>Dereferencing a mapping with a nonexistent key returns nil.</li>

  <li>To remove an element from a mapping, assign nil to the mapping
  dereferenced with that element's key.</li>

  <li>nil is a perfectly good boolean value -- saying "if(nil)" is valid
  syntax. The body of the if statement will never execute, since nil is
  always false. Using "if(!nil)" is also valid syntax, and the body of
  the if statement will always execute.</li>

  <li>nil is a valid value of type string, object, array or mapping. You
  can compare it against those objects to see if they're initialized.
  You can't, however, compare nil against an int or float with ==. Doing
  so is a compile-time error.</li>

  <li>nil is the value of varargs (optional) parameters of the types
  mentioned above when the function caller doesn't supply those
  parameters.</li>
</ul>

<a name="AtomicFunc" id="AtomicFunc"></a>

<h2>How do Atomic Functions work?</h2>

<p>Here's a link to this topic in the <a href=
"../LPC/section_42.html#SEC4.2.4.5">LPC textbook</a>.</p>

<h3>More about Atomic functions:</h3>

<p>The atomic function feature is probably the most significant addition
to LPC since mappings. I'll give two examples to explain how it affects
code.</p>
<hr style="width: 30%" />

<p>The 2.4.5 mudlib for DGD contains the following code in
/dgd/lib/inventory.c:</p>
<pre>
@@INCLUDE move_snippet@@
</pre>

<p>This code is called from the move_object() efun to do the actual
movement. If it were to fail halfway through, this would result in an
inconsistency. For example, if the inventory array of `dest' already has
the maximum size, adding the object `obj' to the inventory of `dest'
will result in an error; this will leave the environment of `obj' set to
`dest' while `obj' is not actually in the inventory of `dest'.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are some errors that can happen in almost any
code: running out of ticks, or out of stack space for nested function
calls. (It so happens that this particular code snippet is safe from
those errors.)</p>

<p>Now if the function were made atomic, it would either succeed
normally, or fail without making any change at all. The object is either
moved or not moved -- it cannot get stuck in an intermediate state where
it is half moved.</p>

<p>Using atomic is not the only solution. It may be possible to check
for all possible error conditions in advance, and only execute the code
if it's safe. Alternatively, an error occurring halfway through could be
caught, and the already-performed actions could be undone explicitly.
However, using atomic is usually the simplest solution, often the
cheapest, and sometimes the only possible one.</p>

<p>There is a lot of code out there that doesn't check for errors at
all, of course. The atomic function feature could be used to guard such
code from inconsistencies with only minimal rearrangement.</p>
<hr style="width: 30%" />

<p>Another example, not as low-level but still involving movement:</p>

<p>In muds using the 2.4.5 mudlib, sometimes there are rooms with an
error in the reset function -- for example, a monster is cloned that
doesn't exist. If a player moves into such a room and the room is loaded
for the first time, the result is that the player is stuck in a dark
room with no exits (the init() function is never called).</p>

<p>Now if movement into this room were handled by an atomic function,
the player would still see the "error in fabric of space" message but
without actually moving anywhere. Movement has become an atomic
operation, which either succeeds or doesn't happen at all.</p>

<p>Note that calls to atomic functions may be nested, so that both
low-level object movement and player-level movement can be made
atomic.</p>
<hr style="width: 30%" />

<p>So when do we use atomic, and when do we encapsulate code with
rlimits (-1; -1) instead? Use rlimits if you are sure that the code will
succeed if you give it infinite ticks and stack space; use atomic
otherwise. The reason for this is that atomic code executes somewhat
slower than normal code, whereas rlimits has no effect on execution
speed at all.</p>

<p>Unlike rlimits, the use of atomic is not preventable by the mudlib.
This makes using atomic functions the best solution in cases where
rlimits might be preferred, but is unavailable.</p>

<a name="CalloutTiming" id="CalloutTiming"></a>

<h2>How does call_out timing in DGD work?</h2>

<p>In DGD, "call_out" is the kernel function that you use to make
something happen after a certain delay. This can be used for heartbeat
functions, for instance, or to close a network connection that has been
idle too long.</p>

<p>If you start two callouts with a 5 second delay immediately after
eachother, they could be executed in any order. However, they
&lt;will&gt; both be executed before a callout delayed for 6
seconds.</p>

<p>This is also the case for long-term (&gt;= 128 seconds) and
millisecond callouts.</p>

<p>This change substantially speeds up DGD on a multi-processor
system.</p>
<hr />
<a name="StatusFunc" id="StatusFunc"></a>

<h2>Can I use values from the DGD config file in the code?</h2>

<p>In your .dgd file (for instance, mud.dgd for the Kernel MUDLib) there
are some values for various properties of DGD like the sector size and
swap fragment. Many of these values and many others can be queried with
the status() kfun. The constants and offsets for things you can query
with status are put into the autogenerated header file
"/include/status.h" when DGD starts up.</p>

<h2>DGD Memory Management Tidbits</h2>

<p>DGD uses reference counting as its primary method of garbage
collection, like Perl or (I believe) Java. Normally this would mean that
you should absolutely never, ever use circular data structures to avoid
nasty, silent, cumulative memory leaks, but DGD is nicer than Perl or
Java that way. If you leave circular data structures sitting around
before the late 1.2 series, you'll see error messages that look
something like this:</p>

<p>That means that you've made an oops and left a circular data
structure lying around. Now you know, so you can go clean it up. Late in
the 1.2 series, Dworkin added extra code to fix the same problem
silently, so you don't even need to fix your circularities if you don't
care about backwards compatibility.</p>

<h2>Limits on Quantities in DGD</h2>
<pre>
DGD has a number of builtin limits:
 - at most 255 variable definitions per program
 - at most 255 function definitions per program
 - at most 127 function arguments/local variables per function
 - at most 65535 bytes of code per function
 - An object can inherit at most 254 other objects (complication: with
   multiple inheritance, an object inherited more than once may count
   as more than one)
 - strings can be at most 65535 bytes long
 - arrays/mappings can have at most 32767 elements/element pairs

There are also some limits that can be extended with appropriate
changes in dgd/src/config.h:
 - at most 65535 objects
 - at most 65535 swap sectors
</pre>

<p><i>Ed Note: String size is now also adjustable in
config.h.</i><br /></p>

<p>You should note that you can get around the limit on functions per
program listed above by separating the functions into two or more
programs (.c files) and inheriting them. In fact, essentially any limit
above can be avoided if you're creative. For that reason, Dworkin isn't
currently planning to remove any of the limits in the near future,
though there's no technical reason he couldn't.</p>

<h2>What is thread-local storage?</h2>

<p>Dworkin says:</p>

<p>There are variables which are unique within the mud, and which can be
kept in a central object. Thus, for example, has this_player() been
implemented in the 2.4.5 simulation. However, once multi-processor
support is enabled in DGD a variable in an object which is modified in
every thread -- such as this_player(), which is kept as a variable in
/dgd/sys/global -- would effectively undo most of the advantages of
running threads in parallel (for the details on why, I refer to my
previous postings on the subject of multi-processor support; they're in
the mailing list archive).</p>

<p>The solution is thread local storage, which exists only for as long
as the current thread -- usually started by receiving a message or a
callout -- is active. Thread local storage exists only on the stack, not
in an object. By inheriting /kernel/lib/api/tls, objects can access
values in thread local storage, or even change the size of the thread
local store.</p>

<p>TLS is implemented using a trick: the value returned by call_trace()
includes the arguments to all functions. The kernel lib ensures that the
first argument to the second function in the trace is always an array,
which can be retrieved from the trace and accessed directly. By
inheriting /kernel/lib/api/tls [ed: in the kernel MUDLib], this can be
done safely and efficiently.</p>

<h2>What are DGD LightWeight Objects (LWOs)?</h2>

<p>In 1.2.18, Dworkin released the first implementation of lightweight
objects. From a message he wrote:</p>

Phantasmal MUDLib and its Object Manager.</p>

<titledef text="Unsupported Features" />

<h2>What things does DGD explicitly not support? Why not?</h2>

<p>Before answering this there are some things to point out. First,
Dworkin chooses what stays and what goes. If he doesn't want something
in DGD and you do then you're just out of luck. He puts it like
this:</p>
<pre>
DGD is not open source in the ordinary sense.  The availability of new
code, and a consensus that the features added by this code are desirable,
are not sufficient to have that code included into the main source.
What you have to do is convince &lt;me&gt;.  Generally, you may assume that
if I thought a feature desirable, I would have implemented it myself. :)
  </pre>

<p>He also says:</p>
<pre>
I'll retain backward compatibility with LPMud 2.4.5, and with LPC in
previous DGD versions.  Beyond that I'm not interested in introducing
new features just because some other LPC driver has it.  If you want
some feature from MudOS/LDmud/etc, then perhaps your needs are better
served by MudOS/LDMud/etc.
</pre>

<p>However, you can make a patch to DGD and keep it up to date
separately or just use it in your personal copy and not update often.
There are several people who maintain these patches to DGD for things
that they think are important. Patches like that are called packages.
You can find them if you look in the section about downloading DGD.</p>

<p>So first of all, look at the list of packages here and in the
<a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/">DGD FAQ</a>. Anything that's a
package there means that Dworkin doesn't think it belongs in DGD. So if
what you want is outgoing network connections or ANSI color codes,
you're out of luck.</p>

<h3>ANSI Color</h3>

<p>Some terminals don't support ANSI color. They do bad things with
ASCII characters with the high bit set. The normal DGD driver does a
bitwise-and of all outgoing bytes with 0x7F, which strips off the high
bit. That means no ANSI color. If you want it, you can install the
package or have your library implement it using a binary port.</p>

<h3>Foreign-Language Characters</h3>

<p>The standard character set for Windows and many other operating
systems includes foreign characters such as Czech, but sets the high bit
on them. For the same reason as ANSI color above, these aren't supported
in plain DGD, and won't be. Installing the ANSI patch or doing the same
thing manually may fix this problem. See the section on configuring DGD
to use <a href="DGD_Config.html#ANSIColor">ANSI Color</a> for more
details.</p>

<h3>Lambda Functions</h3>

<p>Dworkin doesn't like any of the usual syntaxes for these, and feels
they're unnecessary anyway in a language that already has virtual
function dispatch (like virtual functions in C++). Since you can fake
them using LPC you're not really losing any functionality, even if you
like the syntax and mindset better.</p>

<p>You can also supply a string to "compile_object" rather than having
it read a file. This creates code from strings at object granularity
rather than function granularity, but in many cases it works nicely for
simulating lambda functions. See the Kernel MUDLib <b>code</b> command
for DGD 1.2.41 or later as a fine example.</p>

<h3>Shadows</h3>

<p>There's nothing you can do with shadows that you can't do with
existing stuff in DGD that isn't a security risk. Shadows add very
little functionality and add <i>lots</i> of security risks. DGD is very
security-conscious, so out they go. You can also fake them by patching
call_out at the top levels of your MUDLib. If you don't know how to do
that, consider it a good sign that using shadows is a bigger security
hole than you want in your MUDLib.</p>

<h3>C++-style double slash comments</h3>

<p>Dworkin's against them and they're not standard LPC. If you need them
enough to break compatibility with the rest of the world, install the
package (at least for DGD 1.1-series).</p>

<h3>Outgoing Network Connections</h3>

<p>First of all, notice that there's already a perfectly good package
that implements this. If you really want outgoing network connections,
install the net package. It's easier for you and for us than trying to
get Dworkin to change it. He won't, and we've already seen all the
arguments before. You can too if you check the <a href=
"ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/list-archive/">mailing list
archives.</a></p>

<p>Here is one representative argument of Dworkin's against the
networking package:</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%">What I consider unsafe about the net package
is the fact that it allows outbound connections. It means that someone
who breaks the security of the mud can use it to assault another host.
As long as the server remains a program that can only respond, the worst
thing it can do to your machine is use 100% CPU time, use up a lot of
memory, and crash to leave a large core dump -- it cannot alter or even
read files outside the mudlib directory. If you make a separate file
system partition for the mud, it cannot even use up space intended for
other files.</p>

<p style="font-size: 90%">Take vanilla DGD; install it on a disk
partition of its own in such a way that the entire mudlib tree is on
this partition, and the driver binary, swap file, state dump file and
config file are outside the mudlib tree; run the driver with appropriate
limitations on memory usage. Now you can be absolutely sure that
whatever is being done with DGD, it will not affect your machine other
than by taking a certain amount of disk space, memory, CPU time and
network bandwidth. Your mud might be taken over and the auto object
could be rewritten to evade the restrictions it imposes; and still the
mud cannot exceed these known limitations, no matter how hard the admin
tries to hang himself inside the mud. Nor can it be used to breach the
security of your system, or that of any other.</p>

<p>So why no outbound network connections? Basically, because it's a
security risk. If you miscode your library <i>at all</i> (and please
remember that security is <i>hard</i>) it's possible that your MUD can
be used as a relay to attack other hosts. Dworkin doesn't want to be
party to that. If you're so slick that you can implement a real MUDLib
with no security holes at all, you're also easily skilled enough to
install the net package and adapt it to the latest experimental DGD. And
this way there won't be a common, easy-to-exploit attack against
standard DGD to let MUDs act as a relay for a denial-of-service attack.
Ever.</p>

<p>We're aware that there are protocols like active FTP and InterMUD3
that require outgoing network connections. The net package is waiting
for you.</p>

<h3>Built-in HTTP, FTP, complex telnet, IRC, etc</h3>

<p>DGD won't do automatic HTML output for you, nor automatically respond
to HTTP or FTP requests. It won't send complicated telnet options on the
regular port without the telnet client sending a request for them first.
It won't implement an IRC server, an inetd, a proxy, a firewall, or any
of many other networked servers which it is <i>quite</i> possible to
build on top of DGD. That's for pretty much the same reason your C
compiler doesn't come with source for a full word processor, SSH server,
spreadsheet, and operating system. GCC has been used to write all of
these things but the GCC source doesn't ship with all of them
included.</p>

<p>In the same way, DGD tries not to includes stuff that most of its
users won't need when the few users who <i>do</i> need it can build it
easily in LPC or into the driver. Complex telnet options like detecting
screen size automatically fall into this category, as does HTTP
processing.</p>

<p>If you want to implement any of these, you should use the binary port
or -- for some of them -- install the net package first so you can make
outgoing connections. You'll need to write a little server for each
protocol you want to support so it's a good idea to do web searches and
find an RFC for the protocol you want to use.</p>

<p>If you make your implementation public then I can put a little
advertisement here for it. If you've got the first public FTP or
InterMUD3 implementation, this could be a great way to get a little
traffic to it. Think about it. Incidentally, GurbaLib claims FTP and
InterMUD3 compatibility but I haven't looked at its source and it's not
interoperable with modern DGD.</p>

<p>You can find a little information about implementing certain
standards <a href=
"../LibWriting/index.html#SpecificComponents">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Foreach statements</h3>

<p>Says Dworkin: With regard to foreach in particular, I am skeptical
about the use of this loop construct over a mutable datatype. I think of
LPC as a simple, fairly low-level language and foreach hides details
that should not be hidden. What's worse is that the implementation in
other LPC drivers is plain wrong. [...] Also I have doubts about the
addition of variable declarations in a statement, and non-mutable loop
variables, to LPC.</p>

<p>Obviously you can also do the same thing as a 'foreach' just fine in
existing LPC. You can't write a 'foreach' function, but foreach doesn't
do anything that you can't rewrite as a 'for' loop.</p>

<h3>Exit Codes</h3>

<p>DGD doesn't support exit codes on shutdown. That's because they're
hard to do on many platforms, and exit codes often have different
meanings on different platforms (what numbers mean error to Unix, as
opposed to Win32, say). If you need similar functionality, write your
results to a file and then read the file after MUD shutdown.</p>

<h3>Standard Input</h3>

<p>This feature is also hard to do portably.</p>

<h3>64-bit Integers</h3>

<p>There are no plans to add any new types to DGD's LPC dialect. Ever,
probably. If you need more than 32 bits of integer precision, you can
either use floating-point numbers (which have 36 integer bits of
precision) or ASNs (which have unlimited precision, but are
significantly slower than 32-bit integers).</p>

<p>If you're clever, or own a copy of Numerical Recipes, it's also
possible to roll your own 64-bit operations using pairs of 32-bit
integers.</p>

<h3>Boolean Variables</h3>

<p>In general, it's not obvious what advantages a Boolean type would
have for DGD. Barring some really good reason, Dworkin's not planning to
add any types. Between these two things, Booleans have never made it in,
and aren't going to any time soon.</p>

<h3>More Powerful Editor</h3>

<p>The DGD built-in editor is based strongly on 'ex'. It's a line
editor, something that even most younger programmers are unlikely to
remember, except perhaps from DOS 'edlin'. It does very little for you,
and obviously you could easily make a much better editor. Yet nobody
has. That's because an editor, like other pieces of software, should
really be written for the end-user. Having a more powerful built-in
editor is one of those things like a built-in HTTPD that should instead
be written in LPC.</p>

<h3>Error When Calling Non-Existent Function</h3>

<p>In LPC, when you use a call_other() statement and call a function
that doesn't exist, you just get (nil) returned, not an error. This
isn't likely to change because it's possible to override call_other() in
your AUTO object and check for nonexistent calls to other objects
(except perhaps from the DRIVER object, which doesn't inherit AUTO
implicitly).</p>

<p>In the Kernel Library, you can do this with the extra AUTO object
feature, but objects in your System directory will have to explicitly
inherit the extra AUTO object. Phantasmal does this.</p>

@@TITLE Unsupported Features@@

<h2>What things does DGD explicitly not support? Why not?</h2>

<p>Before answering this there are some things to point out. First,
Dworkin chooses what stays and what goes. If he doesn't want
something in DGD and you do then you're just out of luck. He puts
it like this:</p>
<pre>
DGD is not open source in the ordinary sense.  The availability of new
code, and a consensus that the features added by this code are desirable,
are not sufficient to have that code included into the main source.
What you have to do is convince &lt;me&gt;.  Generally, you may assume that
if I thought a feature desirable, I would have implemented it myself. :)
  
</pre>

<p>He also says:</p>
<pre>
I'll retain backward compatibility with LPMud 2.4.5, and with LPC in
previous DGD versions.  Beyond that I'm not interested in introducing
new features just because some other LPC driver has it.  If you want
some feature from MudOS/LDmud/etc, then perhaps your needs are better
served by MudOS/LDMud/etc.
</pre>

<p>However, you can make a patch to DGD and keep it up to date
separately or just use it in your personal copy and not update
often. There are several people who maintain these patches to DGD
for things that they think are important. Patches like that are
called packages. You can find them if you look in the section about
downloading DGD.</p>

<p>So first of all, look at the list of packages here and in the
<a href="http://dgd.is-here.com/dgd/faq/">DGD FAQ</a>. Anything
that's a package there means that Dworkin doesn't think it belongs
in DGD. So if what you want is outgoing network connections or ANSI
color codes, you're out of luck.</p>

<h3>ANSI Color</h3>

<p>Some terminals don't support ANSI color. They do bad things with
ASCII characters with the high bit set. The normal DGD driver does
a bitwise-and of all outgoing bytes with 0x7F, which strips off the
high bit. That means no ANSI color. If you want it, you can install
the package or have your library implement it using a binary
port.</p>

<h3>Foreign-Language Characters</h3>

<p>The standard character set for Windows and many other operating
systems includes foreign characters such as Czech, but sets the
high bit on them. For the same reason as ANSI color above, these
aren't supported in plain DGD, and won't be. Installing the ANSI
patch or doing the same thing manually may fix this problem. See
the section on configuring DGD to use <a href=
"DGD_Config.html#ANSIColor">ANSI Color</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>Lambda Functions</h3>

<p>Dworkin doesn't like any of the usual syntaxes for these, and
feels they're unnecessary anyway in a language that already has
virtual function dispatch (like virtual functions in C++). Since
you can fake them using LPC you're not really losing any
functionality, even if you like the syntax and mindset better.</p>

<p>You can also supply a string to "compile_object" rather than
having it read a file. This creates code from strings at object
granularity rather than function granularity, but in many cases it
works nicely for simulating lambda functions. See the Kernel MUDLib
<b>code</b> command for DGD 1.2.41 or later as a fine example.</p>

<h3>Shadows</h3>

<p>There's nothing you can do with shadows that you can't do with
existing stuff in DGD that isn't a security risk. Shadows add very
little functionality and add <i>lots</i> of security risks. DGD is
very security-conscious, so out they go. You can also fake them by
patching call_out at the top levels of your MUDLib. If you don't
know how to do that, consider it a good sign that using shadows is
a bigger security hole than you want in your MUDLib.</p>

<h3>C++-style double slash comments</h3>

<p>Dworkin's against them and they're not standard LPC. If you need
them enough to break compatibility with the rest of the world,
install the package (at least for DGD 1.1-series).</p>

<h3>Outgoing Network Connections</h3>

<p>First of all, notice that there's already a perfectly good
package that implements this. If you really want outgoing network
connections, install the net package. It's easier for you and for
us than trying to get Dworkin to change it. He won't, and we've
already seen all the arguments before. You can too if you check the
<a href="ftp://ftp.dworkin.nl/pub/dgd/list-archive/">mailing list
archives.</a></p>

<p>Here is one representative argument of Dworkin's against the
networking package:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I consider unsafe about the net package is the fact that
  it allows outbound connections. It means that someone who breaks
  the security of the mud can use it to assault another host. As
  long as the server remains a program that can only respond, the
  worst thing it can do to your machine is use 100% CPU time, use
  up a lot of memory, and crash to leave a large core dump -- it
  cannot alter or even read files outside the mudlib directory. If
  you make a separate file system partition for the mud, it cannot
  even use up space intended for other files.</p>

  <p>Take vanilla DGD; install it on a disk partition of its own in
  such a way that the entire mudlib tree is on this partition, and
  the driver binary, swap file, state dump file and config file are
  outside the mudlib tree; run the driver with appropriate
  limitations on memory usage. Now you can be absolutely sure that
  whatever is being done with DGD, it will not affect your machine
  other than by taking a certain amount of disk space, memory, CPU
  time and network bandwidth. Your mud might be taken over and the
  auto object could be rewritten to evade the restrictions it
  imposes; and still the mud cannot exceed these known limitations,
  no matter how hard the admin tries to hang himself inside the
  mud. Nor can it be used to breach the security of your system, or
  that of any other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why no outbound network connections? Basically, because it's
a security risk. If you miscode your library <i>at all</i> (and
please remember that security is <i>hard</i>) it's possible that
your MUD can be used as a relay to attack other hosts. Dworkin
doesn't want to be party to that. If you're so slick that you can
implement a real MUDLib with no security holes at all, you're also
easily skilled enough to install the net package and adapt it to
the latest experimental DGD. And this way there won't be a common,
easy-to-exploit attack against standard DGD to let MUDs act as a
relay for a denial-of-service attack. Ever.</p>

<p>We're aware that there are protocols like active FTP and
InterMUD3 that require outgoing network connections. The net
package is waiting for you.</p>

<p><i>updates:</i></p>

<p>The net package isn't maintained by Dworkin, and the current
version is hopelessly out of date. Please try (insert link to
bart's package here). However, if you have serious plans to use the
upcoming DGD MP, you should take a look at LPCSSH.</p>

<h3>Built-in HTTP, FTP, complex telnet, IRC, etc</h3>

<p>DGD won't do automatic HTML output for you, nor automatically
respond to HTTP or FTP requests. It won't send complicated telnet
options on the regular port without the telnet client sending a
request for them first. It won't implement an IRC server, an inetd,
a proxy, a firewall, or any of many other networked servers which
it is <i>quite</i> possible to build on top of DGD. That's for
pretty much the same reason your C compiler doesn't come with
source for a full word processor, SSH server, spreadsheet, and
operating system. GCC has been used to write all of these things
but the GCC source doesn't ship with all of them included.</p>

<p>In the same way, DGD tries not to includes stuff that most of
its users won't need when the few users who <i>do</i> need it can
build it easily in LPC or into the driver. Complex telnet options
like detecting screen size automatically fall into this category,
as does HTTP processing.</p>

<p>If you want to implement any of these, you should use the binary
port or -- for some of them -- install the net package first so you
can make outgoing connections. You'll need to write a little server
for each protocol you want to support so it's a good idea to do web
searches and find an RFC for the protocol you want to use.</p>

<p>If you make your implementation public then I can put a little
advertisement here for it. If you've got the first public FTP or
InterMUD3 implementation, this could be a great way to get a little
traffic to it. Think about it. Incidentally, GurbaLib claims FTP
and InterMUD3 compatibility but I haven't looked at its source and
it's not interoperable with modern DGD.</p>

<p>You can find a little information about implementing certain
standards <a href=
"../LibWriting/index.html#SpecificComponents">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Foreach statements</h3>

<p>Says Dworkin: With regard to foreach in particular, I am
skeptical about the use of this loop construct over a mutable
datatype. I think of LPC as a simple, fairly low-level language and
foreach hides details that should not be hidden. What's worse is
that the implementation in other LPC drivers is plain wrong. [...]
Also I have doubts about the addition of variable declarations in a
statement, and non-mutable loop variables, to LPC.</p>

<p>Obviously you can also do the same thing as a 'foreach' just
fine in existing LPC. You can't write a 'foreach' function, but
foreach doesn't do anything that you can't rewrite as a 'for'
loop.</p>

<h3>Exit Codes</h3>

<p>DGD doesn't support exit codes on shutdown. That's because
they're hard to do on many platforms, and exit codes often have
different meanings on different platforms (what numbers mean error
to Unix, as opposed to Win32, say). If you need similar
functionality, write your results to a file and then read the file
after MUD shutdown.</p>

<h3>Standard Input</h3>

<p>This feature is also hard to do portably.</p>

<h3>64-bit Integers</h3>

<p>There are no plans to add any new types to DGD's LPC dialect.
Ever, probably. If you need more than 32 bits of integer precision,
you can either use floating-point numbers (which have 36 integer
bits of precision) or ASNs (which have unlimited precision, but are
significantly slower than 32-bit integers).</p>

<p>If you're clever, or own a copy of Numerical Recipes, it's also
possible to roll your own 64-bit operations using pairs of 32-bit
integers.</p>

<h3>Boolean Variables</h3>

<p>In general, it's not obvious what advantages a Boolean type
would have for DGD. Barring some really good reason, Dworkin's not
planning to add any types. Between these two things, Booleans have
never made it in, and aren't going to any time soon.</p>

<p>Besides, there is nothing that can be done with a boolean that
cannot also be done with an int. If you need booleans, consider bit
fiddling.</p>

<h3>More Powerful Editor</h3>

<p>The DGD built-in editor is based strongly on 'ex'. It's a line
editor, something that even most younger programmers are unlikely
to remember, except perhaps from DOS 'edlin'. It does very little
for you, and obviously you could easily make a much better editor.
Yet nobody has. That's because an editor, like other pieces of
software, should really be written for the end-user. Having a more
powerful built-in editor is one of those things like a built-in
HTTPD that should instead be written in LPC.</p>

<p>For editing LPC source (or, in fact, anything else in the mud
directory), it's probably better to fire up an editor on the server
and edit it from there. Barring that, ftp should work nicely. DGD's
internal editor should likely be considered a least common
denominator, at least minimally useful and almost always available
as a last resort.</p>

<h3>Error When Calling Non-Existent Function</h3>

<p>In LPC, when you use a call_other() statement and call a
function that doesn't exist, you just get (nil) returned, not an
error. This isn't likely to change because it's possible to
override call_other() in your AUTO object and check for nonexistent
calls to other objects (except perhaps from the DRIVER object,
which doesn't inherit AUTO implicitly).</p>

<p>In the Kernel Library, you can do this with the extra AUTO
object feature, but objects in your System directory will have to
explicitly inherit the extra AUTO object. Phantasmal does this.</p>

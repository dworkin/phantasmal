<h2>Using DGD's parse_string Kfun</h2>

<p>The parse_string kfun is a very powerful parser to which you
supply a grammar of your choice. It's much like lex and yacc, and
defines its own mini-language within DGD, much as lex and yacc do
with C.</p>

<p>For a basic overview of parse_string(), please read
dgd&frasl;doc&frasl;parser. It came with your DGD distribution. It
will answer your basic questions. It's the most updated and most
definitive document on how parse_string() behaves.</p>

<h3>Tokenizing</h3>

<p>A parse_string() grammar has two types of symbols. One is for
tokens, the other (called a 'production') is for nonterminal
symbols. Every grammar must contain at least one token rule and at
least one production rule.</p>

<p>The input string is first broken up into tokens and whitespace.
Whitespace is ignored. The entire input must be parsed into valid,
legal tokens or the parsing fails entirely. Then the tokens are
parsed according to the nonterminal rules. There is a special
'whitespace' token rule, called 'whitespace', which is how
whitespace is distinguished from regular tokens.</p>

<p>Tokens match longest-first &mdash; that is, the token rule that
matches the longest chunk of test will be used, even if another
token rule matches a shorter string 'more exactly'. If two rules
match the same string (and thus the same length), then the rule
that is first in the grammar will be used.</p>

<p>There is a special token rule, called 'nomatch'. If you say, in
your grammar, <tt>mytoken = nomatch</tt>, then the token 'mytoken'
will be used for any string that doesn't match another token. The
nomatch rule can be quite inefficient. On a complicated grammar,
though, it's usually still more efficient than using sscanf() or
implode()&frasl;explode() rather than parse_string().</p>

<h3>Production Rules</h3>

<h3>Literal Strings</h3>

<p>If you use literal strings (like 'foo') in your production
rules, then those literal strings will effectively be defined as
tokens, and they will come 'first' in your grammar. That means that
they will be matched as literal strings in preference to any other
rule that you define. That can cause a problem with a grammar
like:</p>
<pre>
  word = &frasl;[a-z]+&frasl;

  rule : word 'foo'
  
</pre>

<p>Then the 'word' regexp will never match 'foo' because it is used
in the grammar. A workaround here is to do something like this:</p>
<pre>
  word = &frasl;[a-z]+&frasl;

  rule : _word 'foo'

  _word : word
  _word : 'foo'
  
</pre>

<h3>Ambiguous Matching</h3>

<p>DGD's parse_string, unlike most parsers, keeps track of all your
ambiguous matches. That fact is both a great power and a great
responsibility. What that means is that if your grammar allows
something to be parsed a couple of different ways then DGD will
keep track of them all while parsing. If there are two ways to
parse a double-if statement with else (the else can go with either
if) in your grammar, and you feed parse_string a chunk with fifteen
of those, you'll find that DGD is keeping track of 2^15 (that's a
little more than 32,500) different interpretations of your file.
Then it will cheerfully return only the first. That's slow, just in
case you hadn't guessed.</p>

<p>Similarly, if your grammar contains a rule like
<tt>element_list: element_list ',' element_list</tt> and also a
rule to have <tt>element_list</tt> match, say, an integer, then the
input "17,25,3,17534,37,3524,2,1,359" will also have many possible
parse trees, and will also take a very long time to complete. In a
library like the Kernel Library that tries to prevent infinite
loops, you'll usually find you're out of ticks and one of your
rlimits() statements interrupts you midway through the parsing.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you <i>want</i> ambiguous parsing. For
instance, you may have a natural language parser for player
commands, and you'd like the player to be able to type "get down"
and have it mean either of "get down from the platform" or "take
the down pillow" according to two different grammar rules. DGD's
parse_string will return both parses, and you can decide which
makes more sense for the player currently. Most parsers won't find
all ambiguous matches for a given grammar and input.</p>

<p>The parse_string() kfun allows you to specify how many ambiguous
parsings you want returned. However, DGD will track all of them (or
at least the first 32000 and some), no matter how few you specify,
throughout the process. That's necessary because the LPC functions
that you call on nonterminal rules can disqualify a particular
parse tree, so you may need to keep all of them around to try out.
If you say you want the first three returned, but only two of the
first 10,000 parse trees turns out to be valid after your LPC code
is called, then DGD did the right thing by not throwing away the
next 10,000 parse trees, right?</p>

<p>Note that you can apply rules in different orders and get to the
same parse tree. This does <i>not</i> cause ambiguous parsing, and
does <i>not</i> come with a big speed penalty. When figuring out
whether you can have ambiguous parses with your grammar, just look
at whether the same input string can match multiple different parse
trees.</p>

<h3>Efficiency of parse_string() vs sscanf() vs explode()</h3>

<p>The sscanf() solution is usually fastest for simple operations,
especially if most of the text is static and there is only a single
occurrence of the string you're trying to extract. If there are
multiple occurrences and the pattern is simple, explode() (or a
combination of explode() and implode()) is usually fastest.
parse_string() is likely to be fastest in other cases, especially
with a complex grammar.</p>

<h3>Caching</h3>

<p>parse_string() precalculates a significant amount of state
(called a DFA) when it determines how to parse according to a
particular grammar. When you first call parse_string(), this DFA is
created and stored in the object that called parse_string(). That
means that if you have multiple grammars, it is often faster to
store them in multiple, separate objects so that each object can
keep its own precalculated DFA rather than having to recalculate
every time it changes from one grammar to another.</p>

<h3>Other Tutorials</h3>

<p>A fellow on the list named Steve Foley has graciously put
together a tutorial on parse_string, with the aid of Erwin Harte.
You can find it <a href=
"../external/parse_string.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>Dworkin says: you can read up on grammars in books about
compiler construction, the Chomsky language hierarchy, or even in
Linux documentation for flex and yacc. A good book about compiler
construction is:<br>
<i>Aho, Sethi, Ullman: Compilers -- Principles, Techniques, and
Tools<br>
Addison Wesley 1986, second edition</i></p>

<p>Par Winzell recommends the Dragon Book:<br>
<i>Principles, Techniques and Tools, by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi,
and Jeffrey D. Ullman<br>
Addison-Wesley 1986; ISBN 0-201-10088-6)</i></p>

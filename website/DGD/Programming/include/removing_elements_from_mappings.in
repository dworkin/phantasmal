Several ways.

Yes:

  mapping m;

  m = ([ 1: 2 ]);
  m = m - ({ 1 });

  m is now ([ ])

This does the same thing:

  m -= ({ 1 });

Assigning a nil value to an index is another way of removing an
index:value pair from a mapping.  Correct.  If you want to use nil
anyway, you could for instance use 1-sized arrays instead of the
actual values.

The only effect the typechecking option has is that for values 0 and 1
you can accomplish the same thing using 0 instead of nil (more to the
point, nil _is_ 0 in those situations).

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

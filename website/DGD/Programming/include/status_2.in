I think you want to look into sscanf() to replace
seek_and_return_string().

The 'issue' and 'unique id for master object' refer to the same
thing.  I would describe O_INDEX as a unique identifier for the _code_
that an object runs with, which for clones would be the code of the
master object from which the clone was made.

Hope that helps,

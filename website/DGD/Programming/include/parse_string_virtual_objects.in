parse_string() will always attempt all possible ambiguous parsings,
even if you do not instruct it to return more than one parse tree.
This is unlikely ever to be a problem with parsing player commands,
but it can be terrible when you try to parse a much longer string
with a grammar that contains a few innocent mistakes.

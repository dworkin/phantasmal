Sorta. When an existing object is updated in DGD, create() is
not called in the object. Because, in the channel_d, the data
is loaded in create, when you update it, the data is not there.

There are several fixes:

1) Change your update command to invoke create() if the object
existed before, or at least, have a flag so the user can invoke
that behavior;

2) Change the channel daemon so that, when any call is made into
it, it will check to see if its data is loaded, and load it if not;

3) Create a new command, like the update command, that invokes
create() when you want to.

All of these have drawbacks.

The soul daemon has the same problem (in fact, that's usually
the one people notice first).

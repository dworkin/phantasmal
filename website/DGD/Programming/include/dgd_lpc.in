Yes, a new array is created whenever the interpreter encounters ({ })
and reference comparison between two separate instances obviously fails. 

However -- to be quite picky -- since assignment also uses references,
you -can- have ({ }) equal ({ }), sort of, since

	a = b = ({ }), a == b

is true... this is a pretty common LPC mistake too, that I see a lot of
wizards make on Muds, and understandably so, too... since LPC does hide
most yukky reference stuff well.

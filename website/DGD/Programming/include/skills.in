As soon as possible after the current thread ends.  Having it execute
_during_ this loop of execution (thread) would make it a call_other()
effectively, which wouldn't be very useful.

The only thing that could cause the 0-call_out not to be execute
right after the current thread is if there are other 0-callouts
waiting to be executed.

Hope that helps,

Erwin.

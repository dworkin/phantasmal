It is not required for the mapping -- destruct objects in a mapping are 
removed from it -- but if you did not remove the user object from the 
array, the array would contain an explicit nil. That's tolerable from 
time to time, of course; any access to this array could just make sure 
to wipe 'nil' values from it. However, in this case, the logout is the 
more well-structured approach, eh?

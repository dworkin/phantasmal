When data is not local to objects, you'd need a separate lock for every
datastructure that can be referenced...  you might call that "death by
a thousand locks." :)

This isn't true because atomic rollback happens within an execution
round, where data <can> be shared between objects.  Atomic rollback
therefore is implemented for datastructures, not for object dataspaces,
but the overhead is still quite reasonable, precisely because the
situation can only persist for the duration of the execution round.

There would be three instances: one original which is only modified when
a change is committed, and two copies, one in each thread's own memory
space.  Memory is cheap these days, and avoiding locking is more important
than saving space.

DGD/MP uses much, much more memory than DGD.

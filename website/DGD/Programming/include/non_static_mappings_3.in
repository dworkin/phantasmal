It's true for ob1 as well.  You could use this feature to easily keep
track of the online players by having a map from <connection-object>
to '1' and only update it when someone (re)enters the game.  If
someone logs out or loses his/her/its link the mapping will
automatically be cleaned out, so less effort there.

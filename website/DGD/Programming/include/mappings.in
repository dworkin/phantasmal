Not in the general case but for that particular one you could use
mapping-subranges:

    string  verb, verb0, *matches;
    mapping verbs;

    verb0 = verb;
    verb0[strlen(verb0) - 1]++;

    matches = map_indices(verbs[verb..verb0]) - ({ verb0 });

This is untested code, so the usual disclaimers apply. ;-)

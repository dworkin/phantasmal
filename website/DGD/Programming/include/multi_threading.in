Subject: [DGD] Multi Threading

  Those things are quite handleable now.  But if you
mean, "will any thread appear to always be running and
never exit?", the answer is "no".  Threads will still
spawn often and terminate quickly, it's just that more
than one may be running at the same time.
  Remember that DGD does a certain amount of heavy
lifting when threads terminate (swapping objects to
disk, recompiling objects, etc), and that still has to
happen, and happen often.

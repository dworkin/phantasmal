Hmm... using Elemel's code (untested):

    static string
    regsub(string str, string regexp, string subst)
    {
	string *bits;

	bits = parse_string("whitespace = /" + regexp + "/\n"
			  + "text = nomatch\n"
			  + "TEXT: text TEXT\n"
			  + "TEXT:", str);
	return implode(bits, subst);
    }

You could probably do this without the implode if you used a different
token than whitespace for the regexp and an extra function to replace
the token with the substitute text.

If you mean that you use array addition and subtraction whenever you
create a new clone or destruct an old one, then that's not really an
option. Both cloning and destructing N objects then becomes pretty much
a O(N^2) operation. You really want to stay away from those.

Alternately, perhaps you have an array of arrays that you index by the
'clone number' of the clone? That'd solve the time complexity problem,
but use a hell of a lot of space.

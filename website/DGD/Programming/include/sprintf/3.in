While the downside of linking in a sprintf() from an outside source is
that you may get different behaviour depending on what platform you're
compiling your driver on with as effect that the mudlib may work on
your main server but may misbehave on a test-copy elsewhere.

Additionally you get all the potential buffer overflows and such for
free while ignoring DGD's sturdy built-in string type.

I'll agree that aside from some samples I haven't seen many people use
DGD's extension interface.  You are aware of its existence, I assume?

True.  On the other hand you're welcome to ask questions and over time
I've seen several examples float by, including a (now slightly
outdated) grammar for LPC itself, from Dworkin. :)

Cheers,

Erwin.

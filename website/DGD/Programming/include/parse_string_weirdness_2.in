Subject: [DGD] parse_string() wierdness???

Here's my take on this, from doing something similar in Phantasmal's UNQ 
format.  When you include the whitespace token in LPC, the \n is converted 
to a newline as part of interpreting LPC, not by 
parse_string.  parse_string gets a string that already has newlines in it.

When you have the \n in a file, and read it in using read_file, what you 
get are two characters, '\' and 'n'.  If you want that converted to a 
newline, you'll have to make a pass through yourself to detect the common 
escape sequences and insert the correct single character into the string, 
before calling parse_string.

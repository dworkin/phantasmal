<h2>Phantasmal Credits</h2>

<p>The Phantasmal MUDLib is primarily written and maintained by
Noah Gibbs. Other contributors include:</p>

<h3>Credits:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Keith Dunwoody for patches to merge PORTABLED with MAPD, for
  the new parser, for major contributions to the MOBILE
  infrastructure, and a patch to add new modifiers to UNQ
  DTDs.</li>

  <li>Dan Parks for the new exits code, for a bugfix with user
  login and password changing, and for some miscellaneous other
  bugfinding.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.monkeyspeak.com">Tom Lokovic</a> for
  testing, ideas, and work on various speculative or related
  projects, including the original design of the UNQ format</li>

  <li>Gary Preston for a useful patch for the zonefile and general
  brainstorming and debugging</li>

  <li>Neil McBride for miscellaneous code and ideas</li>

  <li>Jay Shaffstall for StringD code and escape character codes
  for UNQ parsers</li>

  <li>Mark Luszniak for requesting more documentation and for
  submitting simple object code.</li>

  <li>Chris Meshkin for ideas and discussion</li>

  <li>Other MUDLib authors, who provide ideas and competition.
  Thanks to Steve Schmidt (Melville), Erlend Simonsen (GurbaLib)
  and Tim Hollebeek(Lima). With luck, I'll soon be able to thank
  the authors of Macrocosm, Whedimer, Aexeon and Last Bastion for
  the same.</li>

  <li>Noah Gibbs, who bravely carried the Phantasmal torch through
  thick and thin long before I had even heard of DGD.</li>

  <li>And naturally, no set of credits for a DGD MUDLib would be
  complete without mentioning Felix Croes (Dworkin), who wrote and
  maintains DGD and the Kernel library.</li>

  <li>Additional web-specific credits to <a href=
  "http://www.yourhtmlsource.com">HTMLSource</a> . It's the HTML
  tutorial site I've been hunting for years, and now it finally
  exists! Now if they'll just mention how to do the equivalent in
  correct XHTML in more of the examples...</li>

  <li>And for me, the new admin, I'd like to recommend <a href=
  "http://www.w3schools.com">The W3 Schools</a>, a fantastic
  experimental site that covers the XHTML stuff missing in the
  previous link. It even has a "try it!" function that lets you
  instantly view the results of your XHTML source. It really came
  in handy bringing this site into compliance with XHTML 1.0
  Strict, first when I gave the website a compliance check, and
  again after I broke it during overhaul :P</li>

  for the most complete current list of contributors.</li>

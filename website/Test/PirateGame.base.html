<h2>Game Design for 'Seas of Night'</h2>

<p>The one-line summary: you're crew on a ghost ship, trying to
make your way in the 'world'.</p>

<p>The ghost ship is crewed by ghosts and by the Damned. Ghosts can
fetch and carry, and can fight with sword and cannon. They can't be
killed, and so are an utter terror to living defenders. Ghosts feel
the pain, cold and hunger of their wretched afterlife day and
night, and feel relief only when they feed on the warmth and
strength of the living or the Damned.</p>

<p>The Damned have bodies, and strong ones, though they slowly
decay. Each is branded with the personal mark of the captain who
stole his soul. They burn constantly with the lust for vengeance on
the captain who controls them and on the living who failed them.
The Damned, if killed, rise again as ghosts.</p>

<p>The crew travel in a tattered ship upon the Sea of Night. The
waves of the Sea carry ships between the worlds. Neither sun nor
moon shine upon its surface, and only rarely does the wind shift or
a fog roll in. Each tattered ship has a captain and a crew of
sailors and freebooters, pirates all. Living captives aren't taken
on board. The crew sails from port to port upon the Sea of Night.
The ports can be separated by thousands of miles, by millennia, or
by boundaries between worlds. The Sea has no connection to ordinary
time or geography, and the distances between ports have no relation
to their true distances in time and space. Navigating the Sea is
very difficult, and the captain and navigator usually guard the
secrets of the skill closely. Certain ports aren't known by most
ships, and a truly skilled captain or navigator will know several
ports that aren't on the maps.</p>

<p>A ghostly night raid on a port, or a ship near the port, can
only go one way. The living simply cannot stand against unkillable
enemies. The only question is how many of the living flee, and how
many are killed or captured. The Damned crewmen can be killed, but
they turn into more ghosts. The living, if captured by the crew,
can be turned into more of the Damned.</p>

<p>The process of conversion is simple, and horrific. Living
captives are lined up. One captive at a time, the captain pulls the
burning metal brand from the fire and sets his devilish mark upon
the unfortunate. The captive convulses, thrashes, and after a few
seconds wakes up again, either as his own man or Damned. The former
are usually put to death, and may never be successfully
converted.</p>

<p>The Damned are supernaturally strong, about twice as strong as a
man, and vigorously healthy. They are immune to normal amounts of
heat and cold. In a fight or a raid, the captain may call them to
battle rage. The battle rage makes them even stronger, and very
quick, and allows them to do damage even to ghosts. When raging,
they will mindlessly defend or obey the captain that converted
them, even to the point of their death. The rage exhausts them, and
afterwards they must rest.</p>

<p>At once the footsoldiers and the lifesblood of the ship, the
Damned feed and strengthen the ghosts among the crew as well.
Simply being nearby makes the ghosts a bit more substantial and
capable, and for greater power they can feed parasitically. While
this weakens the Damned, it lets the invulnerable ghosts go into
combat with some of their power, without risking the death of the
Damned themselves. It also briefly quiets the supernatural hunger
and cold of the ghostly crewmen.</p>

<p>Mutinies are frequent. Ambitious players will often aim for
captaincy. There are several obstacles to a mutiny. One is
navigation -- the crew won't mutiny unless one of the mutineers
knows how to navigate, which often requires the complicity of the
original navigator (directly or otherwise). Another obstacle is
that the mutineers must be stronger in a fight than the loyal crew,
preferably far stronger. Even if the would-be captain can sway the
majority of the ghosts, the Damned obey the captain involuntarily
if they were converted by him. A mutineer can have the entire
crew's cooperation, but still the Damned will fight for the captain
when the rage strikes them -- they have no choice. And finally, the
new captain must have the approval of the ship.</p>

<p>The ship obeys only a single captain, and will choose another
when the first is destroyed or resigns. However, it won't
necessarily choose the head mutineer in a mutiny. Its decisions are
inscrutable, and being forsaken by the ship is another worry on the
head of every mutineer. It is possible, but very unusual, for the
ship to choose a crewman and he simply sails for the captain,
though only rarely will this occur.</p>

<p>A captain's first defense against mutiny is to convert many of
the Damned, since they fight only for him, and they keep the
ghostly crew fed and satisfied. The captain is also careful to keep
the secrets of navigation, of branding the Damned and of the ship's
favor close to his vest, lest others learn them. And when he first
takes a ship, many a prudent captain will find an excuse to kill
off all the Damned on board. They were converted by the old captain
and do not serve the new one as loyally. As ghosts they are no more
loyal -- but ghosts are weaker, and may be more easily kept in
check. After a few good raids on ports the new order of the Damned
will rule, and the ghosts will grow more content with regular
feeding.</p>

<p>No ship stays long at any one port of call. Even though they
can't be defeated by swords or cannonfire, the ghosts will turn
insubstantial and weak in the sunlight, and eventually be consumed
entirely unless the Damned can continue to lend them strength. The
Damned lose much power in the daylight as well, but won't be
destroyed by it. Keeping a beachhead occupied for long would
require many Damned and few ghosts, and would need to raid the
surrounding land often.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the crewmen, Damned and ghosts alike, cannot
travel far from the ports where they dropped anchor -- a fog, solid
to the crew and invisible to the living, blocks them if they get
far. This is also the reason that few ever desert the ship they
came in with. Without it they are limited to a small area, to wait
until the sun comes up. Occasionally a ghost is intentionally
executed this way, left behind by his crewmates.</p>

<p>There are a few ports that are islands on the Sea of Night
itself. The crew can relax and take shore leave there, and meet the
crews of other ships. Occasionally crewmen will desert on these
islands, jumping ship for another captain and a new crew.
Information, strange objects and unusual services are available for
purchase on these islands. Such services are also available at
night in a few terrestrial ports where the bizarre is winked at and
heavily charged for services rendered.</p>

<p>There are a few things specific to ghosts and to the Damned that
can be catered to. Ordinary alcohol will do little to the Damned
and nothing to ghosts. However, certain potent beverages are
available at great price for consumption by the supernatural. There
are also supernatural restraints which can be used to clap even a
ghost in irons. This is normally how a ghost is restrained if he is
left at a port to die.</p>

<p><i>(I really like the following idea, but I'm not sure how to
avoid inflation -- if Essence can be seized by force then players
will destroy NPCs to get it, and if it can be extracted from
oneself they'll destroy their own freshly logged-in spirits. If an
Obol may be extracted but it costs XP, they'll be able to produce
them en masse by botting... Dunno, not sure how to prevent this
happening. Maybe with a difficult-to-get skill and creating Obols
will drain points of this skill? I'd still need to figure out the
economics)</i> Normal money is used for many transactions, but the
rarest currency, used for the weightiest purchases, is the Obol.
The Obol can be absorbed directly by a ghost, and is thus often
impossible to steal. It is seen only rarely, as a blue ellipse of
light, and is extremely valuable. A ghost that is destroyed takes
its wealth, at least in Oboloi, with it.</p>

<p>Ghosts can be destroyed by prolonged exposure to sunlight or far
more slowly by starvation. Feeding from the living or the Damned
will reverse damage from starvation. It will also reverse sunlight
damage if the ghost can feed before fading away entirely. Ghosts
can harm other ghosts, and the Damned can harm ghosts as well.
Rarely one of the living can do damage to a ghost through religious
faith or other supernatural power. Ghosts can also be tossed
overboard on the Sea of Night, which presumably destroys them as
well.</p>

<p>Religious faith among the living will make them far less likely
to become Damned, but make them far more powerful if they are
converted. Very strong faith can drive away ghosts. It can harm
ghosts or the Damned, or offer them the chance to convert and join
with God. Ghosts and the Damned, if converted, are usually
immediately destroyed. An exorcism is possible, and the rumors of
what happens to an exorcised ghost or Damned man disagree wildly.
Very, very few have ever seen the results firsthand.</p>

<p>We use the male pronoun through almost all of this document.
That's because females are far less likely to become ghostly
pirates, and rarely convert successfully to the Damned. Most
frequently, female captives are killed outright rather than being
captured for conversion. Primarily, that's because it's considered
very bad luck to have a woman on board the ship.</p>

<p>In fact, all sorts of things are considered bad luck. Killing or
chasing away certain air and sea creatures is bad luck. Having a
woman on board is bad luck. Having the captain navigate, having no
navigator and having a foolish navigator are all considered bad
luck. So is trying to convert a priest to the Damned. When a ship
goes down that flagrantly flaunts these laws, it gets talked about
across the width of the Sea. When the Drowned Rat goes down, you're
sure to hear if there was a woman on board, or if the lookout
tended to sleep on duty, particularly if it was related in some way
to the reason for the ship being lost.</p>

<h1>Test MUDs</h1>

<p><i>(Coming soon...)</i></p>

<p>Phantasmal, as a mudlib, should be generic and extensible enough
to support different genres of MUD. So, courtesy of
necronomicorp.com, four test MUDs will be hosted, and this should
help debug things.</p>

<p>Please visit the MUD index <a href=
"http://necronomicorp.com/~shentino/phantasmal/testsite/index.html">
here</a> for more information on the test servers and their
operational policies.</p>

<p>Currently, only one test mud has been brought up so far, and
already issues are being revealed. Some bugs in phantasmal have
already been fixed, and when phantasmal is stable enough, running
two different muds off of one phantasmal should help keep out any
game-specific creepages from sneaking into phantasmal.</p>

<p>Regarding status, you may assume the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the test site is down, the muds are down.</li>

  <li>If the test site says the mud is down, then it is so.</li>
</ul>

<p>Design documents for each mud are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="Lovecraft.html">Lovecraft</a>, an oddball default
  the new admin stumbled across</li>

  <li><a href="PirateGame.html">Seas of Night</a>, a ghostly
  adventure on the high seas.</li>

  <li><a href="InnsmouthHigh.html">Innsmouth High</a>, a pretend
  high school set in the Lovecraft genre.</li>

  <li><a href="LightDarkGame.html">Light v. Dark</a>, a power
  balance game.</li>
</ul>

<titledef text="Installing Baseline Phantasmal" />

<h2> Getting Phantasmal Up and Running </h2>

<p>
  The (very) short answer is &quot;check the INSTALL file that came
  with your copy of Phantasmal&quot;.  You'll find it in the top-level
  directory, next to stuff like README and either phantasmal.dgd or
  testgame.dgd.
</p>

<p>
  However, if you're installing non-bundled Phantasmal, there are some
  steps in the README that might require a bit more figuring out.
</p>

<h3> Getting DGD Up and Running </h3>

<p>
  Before you can do anything else, you'll need DGD up and running.
  Usually you can just unpack and patch it (see <a
  href="DGD/DGD_Config.html">instructions elsewhere</a> on how to
  create an experimental copy of DGD).  If you're running something
  other than Linux or OS X, you'll need to modify src/Makefile.
  Specifically, you'll need to change the HOST variable to something
  reasonable.  For instance, old copies of Linux will use the 'LINUX'
  value.  Check the DGD documentation for details if the default
  doesn't work for you.  Then go into the 'src' directory and type
  'make install'.  You'll get an error message on installation, and a
  message saying that the error is being ignored.  That's normal if
  you haven't built DGD before in the same directory, or if you
  deleted the old copy of bin/driver last time.  It's not a problem,
  which is why the error is ignored.
</p>

<p>
  Then, you'll need to test the Kernel Library and make sure it works.
  You'll need to modify 'mud.dgd'.  Specifically, find the
  &quot;directory = &lt;blah&gt;&quot; line, and replace the old
  &quot;blah&quot; value with the right thing for wherever you've put
  DGD.  You'll need to use an absolute path, not a relative path, so
  start with a slash or a drive letter, not a dot or a directory name.
</p>

<p>
  Type &quot;./bin/driver mud.dgd&quot; if you're on Unix, or
  &quot;bin\driver mud.dgd&quot; on Windows.  DGD should tell you what
  version you're using, along with a message telling you that it
  initialized.  Then it'll hang there.  That's expected -- that's what
  your MUD server usually looks like when it's running.
</p>

<p>
  Telnet to your local machine, port 6047.  You should get a login
  prompt.  Log in as &quot;admin&quot; (set the new password to
  whatever you like, it won't matter soon), and type 'who'.  You
  should see that you're logged in.  Typing 'people' will tell you a
  bit more.  You can find out <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">more
  about the Kernel MUDLib user commands</a> if you check the web or
  ask around a little.  For now, don't bother &mdash; you'll be using
  Phantasmal soon anyway.

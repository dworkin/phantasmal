@@TITLE Installing Baseline Phantasmal@@

<p>(soon to be updated, kotaka's install script can also handle
phantasmal pretty well with a little tweaking.)</p>

<p>Before you install Phantasmal, make sure that you read the README
file included.  You can find it in the top level directory.</p>

<p>To get Phantasmal running, you need to do three things.  Get DGD
installed, then install Phantasmal, and finally, there will be some
administrative stuff to do when you log into the MUD for the first time.</p>

<h2>Getting DGD Up and Running</h2>

<p>Before you can do anything else, you'll need DGD up and running.
Before you can do that, you'll need to know which version you need. Your
copy of Phantasmal probably came with a file called TESTED_VERSIONS in
its root directory. That's a text file, which will say something like
"DGD 1.2.90-1.2.93". That means you'll need a recent experimental DGD,
something between 1.2.90 and 1.2.93. So pick your version of DGD with
this in mind. You may also be running other things that require a
specific DGD version.</p>

<p>Usually you'll unpack DGD and patch it (see <a href=
"DGD/Config/index.html">instructions elsewhere</a> on how to create an
experimental copy of DGD). If you're running something other than Linux
or OS X, you'll need to modify src/Makefile. Specifically, you'll need
to change the HOST variable to something reasonable. For instance, old
copies of Linux will use the 'LINUX' value. Check the DGD documentation
for details if the default doesn't work for you. Then go into the 'src'
directory and type 'make install'. You'll get an error message on
installation, and a message saying that the error is being ignored.
That's normal if you haven't built DGD before in the same directory, or
if you deleted the old copy of bin/driver last time. It's not a problem,
which is why the error is ignored.</p>

<p>Then, you'll need to test the Kernel Library and make sure it works.
You'll need to modify 'mud.dgd'. Specifically, find the "directory =
&lt;blah&gt;" line, and replace the old "blah" value with the right
thing for wherever you've put DGD. You'll need to use an absolute path,
not a relative path, so start with a slash or a drive letter, not a dot
or a directory name.</p>

<p>Type "./bin/driver mud.dgd" if you're on Unix, or "bin\driver
mud.dgd" on Windows. DGD should tell you what version you're using,
along with a message telling you that it initialized. Then it'll hang
there. That's expected -- that's what your MUD server usually looks like
when it's running.</p>

<p>Telnet to your local machine, port 6047. You should get a login
prompt. Log in as "admin" (set the new password to whatever you like, it
won't matter soon), and type 'who'. You should see that you're logged
in. Typing 'people' will tell you a bit more. You can find out <a href=
"DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">more about the Kernel MUDLib user
commands</a> if you check the web or ask around a little. For now, don't
bother &mdash; you'll be using Phantasmal soon anyway.</p>

<h2>Getting Phantasmal Up and Running</h2>

<p>Different versions of Phantasmal may have different steps. When in
doubt, check the INSTALL file in the root directory of your Phantasmal
directory. However, the steps below are typical for current non-bundled
Phantasmal installation.</p>

<p>To install Phantasmal, you'll need to put the Kernel Library headers
into place. The easiest way to do that is to copy all the headers from
mud/include/kernel in the Kernel Library into the include/kernel
directory of Phantasmal. It's possible to symbolically link them, but I
wouldn't bother if I were you. When you upgrade the Kernel Library, just
copy the new headers into place. Note that you'll need to upgrade the
Kernel Library when you upgrade DGD, at least if the new DGD version has
a different version of the Kernel Library.</p>

<p>You'll also need to put the rest of the necessary Kernel Library code
into place. If you're on a Unix box, this can be a good opportunity to
use symbolic links. If you're in Phantasmal's kernel subdirectory
(usually called something like mudlib/kernel or
phantasmal-0.016/kernel), and your DGD installation is at a location
called /usr/local/dgd, you'd type <tt>ln -s
/usr/local/dgd/mud/kernel/data .</tt> to symbolically link DGD's
kernel/data directory to act as Phantasmal's kernel/data directory.
You'll need to do this with all four subdirectories of kernel &mdash;
sys, lib, obj and data.</p>

<p>If you're not on a Unix box or don't want to use symbolic links, you
can instead copy the directories into their new locations. Note that
upgrading DGD can be error-prone in either case, and that you may need
to do it slightly differently if you copy than if you symbolically link.
See the PROBLEMS file in the root of your DGD installation for further
details.</p>

<p>Speaking of the PROBLEMS file, make sure to check it if you're having
problems installing. That's what it's there for.</p>

<p>You're also going to need to edit phantasmal.dgd so that it works
right. Specifically, you're going to need to edit the 'directory' entry,
the one that says to replace it with your absolute path. You'll need to
replace it with the absolute path to your copy of Phantasmal.</p>

<p>It needs an absolute path, not a relative one. You should *not* use
the tilde (~) variable on Unix in the path, just use a straight-up path
like "/usr/bob/code/phantasmal".</p>

<p>I like to make a couple of extra convenience files as well.
Specifically, I'll usually link to the dgd/bin directory in my
Phantasmal directory, so instead of running the MUD by typing
"/home/angelbob/code/dgd/bin/driver ./phantasmal.dgd", I can just type
"./bin/driver phantasmal.dgd". It's up to you whether you want to do
something similar, put DGD's driver in your path, write a script to run
DGD for you or what.</p>

<p>I also copy the DGD API documentation into my doc directory.
Specifically, I copy DGD's "doc/kernel" and "doc/kfun" stuff into the
same places under Phantasmal for easy use. Again, you may or may not
want to.</p>

<h3>Once You Can Run Phantasmal</h3>

<p>If you've followed the instructions above faithfully, you should have
a running copy of Phantasmal, which you can access by telnetting to port
8888 of your local machine. If you then login as admin and type "help"
you'll find yourself face to face with a pretty daunting amount of
online help. We consider this a Good Thing (tm).</p>

<p>However, before doing all of that, make yourself a non-admin account.
It's good to have accounts for admins other than just the single lone
"admin" account, because you'd like to have separate space to work in,
different privilege levels for different accounts, and the ability to
have more than one admin log in at once. Good things all.</p>

<p>First, log in and create your new account. Just give the name of the
new account when it asks for the login name, and then pick a new
password when it asks you to. Then, from the admin account (not the new
one, the old one), type <tt>grant &lt;name&gt; access</tt>, but replace
&lt;name&gt; with the actual account name you just made for the new
admin. Don't put it in the greater-than and less-than signs, that's just
to show you what to replace. The line above makes the account an admin
account. That is, it makes it possible for it to have admin privileges,
though it doesn't actually give them any.</p>

<p>Then (no, we're not done yet), still from the old admin account, type
<tt>grant &lt;name&gt; / full</tt>. Replace &lt;name&gt; again with the
same thing. This grants the new admin account full read-write-admin
access (that's what "full" means in the command line above) to the root
directory of your MUD (that's why it's a slash, above &mdash; that means
the very top-level directory). So the new admin gets full-power access
to every file in your MUD. <b>Don't</b> give admin access to somebody
you don't trust. Also, back up your MUD regularly, especially if you're
giving admin access to people that may not be the sharpest knives in the
drawer... They can mess up your MUD by incompetence just as easily as
malice. Easier, usually.</p>

<h3>What Now?</h3>

<p>Well, you have the online help mentioned above (please note that the
help for admin and non-admin accounts is different &mdash; don't be
surprised when you notice). Phantasmal's web site, the one you're
looking at, also includes a wide range of <a href=
"Tutorial">Tutorials</a> and similar documentation, which are highly
recommended. This stuff has all been written &mdash; use it.</p>

@@TITLE Installing Baseline Phantasmal@@ @@SEQUENCE 1@@

<p>(soon to be updated, kotaka's install script can also handle
phantasmal pretty well with a little tweaking.)</p>

<p>Before you install Phantasmal, make sure that you read the
README file included. You can find it in the top level
directory.</p>

<p>To get Phantasmal running, you need to do three things. Get DGD
installed, then install Phantasmal, and finally, there will be some
administrative stuff to do when you log into the MUD for the first
time.</p>

<h2>Getting DGD Up and Running</h2>

<p>Before you can do anything else, you'll need DGD up and running.
Before you can do that, you'll need to know which version you need.
Your copy of Phantasmal probably came with a file called
TESTED_VERSIONS in its root directory. That's a text file, which
will say something like "DGD 1.2.90-1.2.93". That means you'll need
a recent experimental DGD, something between 1.2.90 and 1.2.93. So
pick your version of DGD with this in mind. You may also be running
other things that require a specific DGD version.</p>

<p>Usually you'll unpack DGD and patch it (see <a href=
"DGD/Config/index.html">instructions elsewhere</a> on how to create
an experimental copy of DGD). If you're running something other
than Linux or OS X, you'll need to modify src/Makefile.
Specifically, you'll need to change the HOST variable to something
reasonable. For instance, old copies of Linux will use the 'LINUX'
value. Check the DGD documentation for details if the default
doesn't work for you. Then go into the 'src' directory and type
'make install'. You'll get an error message on installation, and a
message saying that the error is being ignored. That's normal if
you haven't built DGD before in the same directory, or if you
deleted the old copy of bin/driver last time. It's not a problem,
which is why the error is ignored.</p>

<p>Then, you'll need to test the Kernel Library and make sure it
works. You'll need to modify 'mud.dgd'. Specifically, find the
"directory = &lt;blah&gt;" line, and replace the old "blah" value
with the right thing for wherever you've put DGD. You'll need to
use an absolute path, not a relative path, so start with a slash or
a drive letter, not a dot or a directory name.</p>

<p>Type "./bin/driver mud.dgd" if you're on Unix, or "bin\driver
mud.dgd" on Windows. DGD should tell you what version you're using,
along with a message telling you that it initialized. Then it'll
hang there. That's expected -- that's what your MUD server usually
looks like when it's running.</p>

<p>Telnet to your local machine, port 6047. You should get a login
prompt. Log in as "admin" (set the new password to whatever you
like, it won't matter soon), and type 'who'. You should see that
you're logged in. Typing 'people' will tell you a bit more. You can
find out <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">more about the Kernel
MUDLib user commands</a> if you check the web or ask around a
little. For now, don't bother &mdash; you'll be using Phantasmal
soon anyway.</p>

<h2>Getting Phantasmal Up and Running</h2>

<p>Different versions of Phantasmal may have different steps. When
in doubt, check the INSTALL file in the root directory of your
Phantasmal directory. However, the steps below are typical for
current non-bundled Phantasmal installation.</p>

<p>To install Phantasmal, you'll need to put the Kernel Library
headers into place. The easiest way to do that is to copy all the
headers from mud/include/kernel in the Kernel Library into the
include/kernel directory of Phantasmal. It's possible to
symbolically link them, but I wouldn't bother if I were you. When
you upgrade the Kernel Library, just copy the new headers into
place. Note that you'll need to upgrade the Kernel Library when you
upgrade DGD, at least if the new DGD version has a different
version of the Kernel Library.</p>

<p>You'll also need to put the rest of the necessary Kernel Library
code into place. If you're on a Unix box, this can be a good
opportunity to use symbolic links. If you're in Phantasmal's kernel
subdirectory (usually called something like mudlib/kernel or
phantasmal-0.016/kernel), and your DGD installation is at a
location called /usr/local/dgd, you'd type <tt>ln -s
/usr/local/dgd/mud/kernel/data .</tt> to symbolically link DGD's
kernel/data directory to act as Phantasmal's kernel/data directory.
You'll need to do this with all four subdirectories of kernel
&mdash; sys, lib, obj and data.</p>

<p>If you're not on a Unix box or don't want to use symbolic links,
you can instead copy the directories into their new locations. Note
that upgrading DGD can be error-prone in either case, and that you
may need to do it slightly differently if you copy than if you
symbolically link. See the PROBLEMS file in the root of your DGD
installation for further details.</p>

<p>Speaking of the PROBLEMS file, make sure to check it if you're
having problems installing. That's what it's there for.</p>

<p>You're also going to need to edit phantasmal.dgd so that it
works right. Specifically, you're going to need to edit the
'directory' entry, the one that says to replace it with your
absolute path. You'll need to replace it with the absolute path to
your copy of Phantasmal.</p>

<p>It needs an absolute path, not a relative one. You should *not*
use the tilde (~) variable on Unix in the path, just use a
straight-up path like "/usr/bob/code/phantasmal".</p>

<p>I like to make a couple of extra convenience files as well.
Specifically, I'll usually link to the dgd/bin directory in my
Phantasmal directory, so instead of running the MUD by typing
"/home/angelbob/code/dgd/bin/driver ./phantasmal.dgd", I can just
type "./bin/driver phantasmal.dgd". It's up to you whether you want
to do something similar, put DGD's driver in your path, write a
script to run DGD for you or what.</p>

<p>I also copy the DGD API documentation into my doc directory.
Specifically, I copy DGD's "doc/kernel" and "doc/kfun" stuff into
the same places under Phantasmal for easy use. Again, you may or
may not want to.</p>

<h3>Once You Can Run Phantasmal</h3>

<p>If you've followed the instructions above faithfully, you should
have a running copy of Phantasmal, which you can access by
telnetting to port 8888 of your local machine. If you then login as
admin and type "help" you'll find yourself face to face with a
pretty daunting amount of online help. We consider this a Good
Thing (tm).</p>

<p>However, before doing all of that, make yourself a non-admin
account. It's good to have accounts for admins other than just the
single lone "admin" account, because you'd like to have separate
space to work in, different privilege levels for different
accounts, and the ability to have more than one admin log in at
once. Good things all.</p>

<p>First, log in and create your new account. Just give the name of
the new account when it asks for the login name, and then pick a
new password when it asks you to. Then, from the admin account (not
the new one, the old one), type <tt>grant &lt;name&gt; access</tt>,
but replace &lt;name&gt; with the actual account name you just made
for the new admin. Don't put it in the greater-than and less-than
signs, that's just to show you what to replace. The line above
makes the account an admin account. That is, it makes it possible
for it to have admin privileges, though it doesn't actually give
them any.</p>

<p>Then (no, we're not done yet), still from the old admin account,
type <tt>grant &lt;name&gt; / full</tt>. Replace &lt;name&gt; again
with the same thing. This grants the new admin account full
read-write-admin access (that's what "full" means in the command
line above) to the root directory of your MUD (that's why it's a
slash, above &mdash; that means the very top-level directory). So
the new admin gets full-power access to every file in your MUD.
<b>Don't</b> give admin access to somebody you don't trust. Also,
back up your MUD regularly, especially if you're giving admin
access to people that may not be the sharpest knives in the
drawer... They can mess up your MUD by incompetence just as easily
as malice. Easier, usually.</p>

<h3>What Now?</h3>

<p>Well, you have the online help mentioned above (please note that
the help for admin and non-admin accounts is different &mdash;
don't be surprised when you notice). Phantasmal's web site, the one
you're looking at, also includes a wide range of <a href=
"Tutorial">Tutorials</a> and similar documentation, which are
highly recommended. This stuff has all been written &mdash; use
it.</p>

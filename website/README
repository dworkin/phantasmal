                   Phantasmal Website Release

Phantasmal is a fairly complex MUD library, and so it could use good
documentation.  I write and maintain a web site at
"http://phantasmal.sf.net" about Phantasmal's status, and a good
general DGD documentation website at "http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD".
We've had requests for an easily downloadable form of this
documentation, and besides, it's good to have snapshots of how the
documentation changes.  So I plan to periodically make a big tarball
out of all the web pages and files and whatnot.  I make sure to use
relative links for almost everything, so this should work just fine
for local browsing.

Almost all HTML here is generated from .base.html files.  There's a
script called pagecreate.pl that prepends the pageheader file and
appends the pagefooter, and does a little bit of additional text
substitution to create the final .html files.

The API documentation is generated by a script from non-HTML files.
You can see docs on how to use the tool in the README file in that
directory.  I've included all the .api files, which are quite
human-readable, in that directory.  That should let you do your own
HTML browsing if you're so inclined.  Enjoy!

<h3 style="text-align: center"> Phantasmal's License </h3>

<p> I'm a free software guy, mostly.  But as Stallman has
  apparently acknowledged, there are some odd special
  cases.  Not cases where Free Software or Open Source are
  wrong, just cases where they don't work as you'd hope. </p>

<p> For instance, say a corporation grabs a documentation &amp;
  formatting tool.  The company modifies it, passes it around the company,
  generates public documentation from it and otherwise goes
  wild.  As long as that tool's binary executable file stays
  <i>inside</i> the corporation
  they don't have to give out any source code changes they
  make.  Even if they generate publicly-distributed documentation
  from it.  That's a situation where even if you GPL the tool it
  doesn't help.  That's because GPL, like other similar
  licenses, assumes that what you're trying to restrict is
  <i>binary-only distribution</i>.  And for a standard app
  that model works great.  You have to distribute the app for the
  author to steal your accolades and give nothing back. </p>

<p> Where it doesn't work is where the binary doesn't get
  distributed to potential users.  The case above with the
  corporation is just such an example.
  The documentation isn't tied
  to the tool, it's not a derivative work, so none of the
  free software licenses on the tool make a whit of difference.
</p>

<p> Incidentally, some tools (like old versions of GNU bison)
  get around this by sticking
  a whacking great lump of their own code into their output.
  <i>That</i> code <i>is</i> licensed, so the resulting code
  is a derivative work.  That <i>still</i> doesn't solve all
  the problems.
</p>

<p> MUD clients are just apps and standard Free Software and
  Open Source licenses work just fine for them.  You distribute
  the MUD client binary like normal
  and the licenses work as intended.  Somebody modifies the MUD
  client and redistributes it and then has to give out source
  code -- just like the GPL says.
</p>

<p>
  MUD servers are another matter entirely.  An example:  the
  Phantasmal source code gets downloaded
  by Bob the Sysadmin -- so far, so good.  He uses it to run a MUD.
  He makes changes which I, as the author, would love
  to have and distribute.  Let's say Bob writes a feature to get
  all his NPCs to act fully
  intelligent using only 5% of the CPU.  This is a great
  feature that the public can ooh and ahh at, and it's a result
  of my work combined with Bob's.
  We'd like the server to be under some wacky
  Free Software license so that Bob has to show
  me the changes he's made, and regular Phantasmal can also have
  these excellent uber-intelligent NPCs everywhere.  Bob, being
  new to free software, isn't interested in releasing his spiffy
  new feature, and would far rather keep it to himself only.
</p>

<p> Even if I've used the GPL (which is the most restrictive
  Free Software license out there), Bob hasn't distributed me
  a server binary, so he owes me no source code.  All I'm seeing
  are the results of Bob's server running, which entitles me to
  nothing at all -- even though their server is based on my
  work.  The GPL (and all other Open Source and Free Software
  licenses) simply don't cover this at all.
</p>

<p>
  There's one more thing to consider:  content.  A running
  MUD would like to make certain things unavailable to its
  player base, like the solutions to all its puzzles.  I
  don't want a license on the server to say &quot;you have to
  distribute <i>everything</i> to anybody that logs in&quot;.
  If I did, all content and puzzles would have to be public
  to all players as well...  So I'd like to distinguish
  code from content, specifically general code from code
  supporting a particular puzzle.  It's a very difficult
  distinction, especially in a legal license (and I'm not
  a lawyer).
</p>

<p>
  This is a nasty situation.  Since I'm a supporter of Free
  Software and of Open Source, it bugs me.  People are using
  Phantasmal, and
  I really wish there was a good license for this situation.
  If you know of one then please, please let me know.
  Hell, let Richard Stallman know and I'm sure he'll make
  sure everybody else finds out :-)
</p>

<p>
  In the mean time, Phantasmal is entirely in the public domain.
  If I'm not going to be able to restrict its use in the
  way I want to (so I can see the source code to other people's
  features, dammit!) I'm not going to restrict it at all.
  You still need a DGD commercial license to use Phantasmal to
  make money (or else you'll need to port it to something other than
  DGD, which would be very difficult), but that's just because DGD
  requires it -- Phantasmal can be used in any way you please.

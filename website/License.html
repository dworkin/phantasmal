    <h3 align="center"> Phantasmal's License </h3>

    <font size="4">

    <p> I'm a free software guy mostly.  But as Stallman has
      apparently acknowledged, there are some odd special
      cases.  Not cases where Free Software or Open Source are
      wrong, just cases where they don't work as you'd hope. </p>

    <p> For instance, say a corporation grabs a documentation
      formatting tool.  It modifies it internally, passes it around,
      generates public documentation from it and otherwise goes
      wild.  As long as that all stays <i>inside</i> the corporation
      they don't have to give out any source code changes they
      make.  That's a situation where even if you GPL the tool it
      doesn't help.  That's because GPL, like other similar
      licenses, assumes that what you're trying to restrict is
      <i>binary-only distribution</i>.  And for a standard app
      that model works great.  You have to distribute the app for the
      author to steal your accolades and give nothing back. </p>

    <p> Where it doesn't work is where the binary doesn't get
      distributed to potential users.  The case above with the
      corporation generating public documentation using a private
      modification of a GPL'd tool is just such an example.  The
      documentation isn't tied
      to the tool, it's not a derivative work, so none of the
      free software licenses on the tool make a whit of difference.
    </p>

    <p> Incidentally, tools like Bison get around this by sticking
      a whacking great lump of their own code into their output.
      <i>That</i> code <i>is</i> licensed, so the resulting code
      is a derivative work. </p>

    <p> MUD clients are just apps and standard Free Software and
      Open Source licenses work just fine for them.  You distribute
      the MUD client binary like normal
      and the licenses work as intended.
      MUD servers are another matter entirely.  The server binary
      goes to its intended recipient.  He uses it to run a MUD.
      He makes changes which I as the author would love
      to have and distribute.  We'd like the server to be under some
      Free Software license so that the person using it has to show
      me the changes they've made to get all their NPCs to act fully
      intelligent using only 5% of the CPU.  This is a great
      feature that the public can ooh and ahh at, and it's a result
      of my work combined with theirs. </p>

    <p> Even if I've used the GPL (which is about the most restrictive
      Free Software license out there) they haven't distributed me
      a server binary so they owe me no source.  All I'm seeing
      are the results of the server running, which entitles me to
      nothing at all -- even though their server is based on my
      work.  The GPL (and all other Open Source and Free Software
      licenses) simply don't cover this at all. </p>

    <p> There's one more thing to consider:  content.  A running
      MUD would like to make certain things unavailable to their
      player base, like the solutions to all their puzzles.  We
      don't want a license on the server to say &quot;you have to
      distribute <i>everything</i> to anybody that logs in&quot;.
      If we did, all content and puzzles would have to be public
      to all players as well...  So we'd like to distinguish
      code from content, specifically general code from code
      supporting a particular puzzle.  It's a very difficult
      distinction. </p>

    <p> This is a nasty situation, and as I'm a supporter of Free
      Software and of Open Source, it bugs me.  People are using
      Phantasmal, and
      I really wish there was a good license for this situation.
      If you know of one then please, please let me know.
      Hell, let Richard Stallman know and I'm sure he'll make
      sure everybody else finds out :-) </p>

    <p> Anyway -- in the mean time this stuff's all public domain.
      If I'm not going to be able to restrict its use in the
      way I want to (so I can see the source to other people's
      features, dammit!) I'm not going to restrict it at all. </p>

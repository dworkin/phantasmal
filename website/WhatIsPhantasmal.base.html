<p>The Phantasmal MUDLib is a DGD MUDLib, but no longer under
active development. It's the best free MUDLib for DGD if you want
to build most of your game for yourself, or if you want something
unlike a traditional MUD. It has a <a href=
"http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/phantasmal/">project on
SourceForge</a>. Current and older releases can be downloaded
there.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is my personal attempt to <a href="DGD">learn
DGD</a>, to <a href="DGD/Contribute.html">contribute to DGD</a>,
and to put together a MUD server implementing certain things I
think are cool. It isn't an attempt at a full-scale professional
server. It certainly isn't an attempt at anything like the current
crop of Diku derivatives. At the moment Phantasmal focuses on
features that few other MUDLibs provide, though it skimps on some
of the old standbys. For instance, it has an excellent help system,
recompile-in-place, scripting, and some interesting input and
output systems like UNQ and localization. However, it has no combat
system at all.</p>

<p>Phantasmal's design is heavily influenced by <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a>, and more specifically by
<a href="Innsmouth/Articles.html">certain</a> of their <a href=

<p>The Phantasmal MUDLib is a DGD MUDLib, but no longer under active
development. It's the best free MUDLib for DGD if you want to build most
of your game for yourself, or if you want something unlike a traditional
MUD. It has a <a href=
"http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/phantasmal/">project on
SourceForge</a>. Current and older releases can be downloaded there.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is my personal attempt to <a href="DGD">learn DGD</a>, to
<a href="DGD/Contribute.html">contribute to DGD</a>, and to put together
a MUD server implementing certain things I think are cool. It isn't an
attempt at a full-scale professional server. It certainly isn't an
attempt at anything like the current crop of Diku derivatives. At the
moment Phantasmal focuses on features that few other MUDLibs provide,
though it skimps on some of the old standbys. For instance, it has an
excellent help system, recompile-in-place, scripting, and some
interesting input and output systems like UNQ and localization. However,
it has no combat system at all.</p>

<p>Phantasmal's design is heavily influenced by <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a>, and more specifically by <a href=
"Innsmouth/Articles.html">certain</a> of their <a href=

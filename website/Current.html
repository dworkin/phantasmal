<h3 style="text-align: center"> Phantasmal's Current Features </h3>

<p>
  Phantasmal means to be a standard library for certain game features
  like NPCs, rooms and details.  It's a good base to begin
  construction from, but not a full game by itself.  There's a game
  library called Seas of Night which makes a fine example of how
  Phantasmal can be turned into a normal game.  It's distributed as
  part of Bundled Phantasmal, or can be found in the CVS tree.
  Everything in this document is specific to Phantasmal and/or Seas of
  Night.  You could build all sorts of additional new features into a
  Phantasmal game, but this document will only mention it if
  Phantasmal or SoN has already done so.
</p>

<p>
  Phantasmal builds on the code of the DGD Kernel Library and borrows
  specific tricks and concepts from several other MUDLibs.  This gives
  it a good, secure base which is reinforced by additional security
  code in the Phantasmal Game API.  Phantasmal uses a lot of Kernel
  Library features like inheritance, full rebuilding and handling file
  security by user directory.
</p>

<p>
  Phantasmal has recently added scripts, and needs to integrate them
  into more of what it does.  It has added tags, which are arbitrary
  object properties necessary to make scripts useful.
</p>

<p>
  Phantasmal allows logins and talking, chatting on channels and
  emote.  There's a SoulD to handle social commands (like giggle, burp
  and so on).  The usual basic MUD commands for playing with objects,
  containers and rooms are implemented.  There's a quite usable set of
  Online Creation (OLC) commands which allow an administrator to
  create and destroy rooms, portables and exits and set their various
  attributes.  It uses a set of object descriptions inspired by
  Skotos' series of Building Blocks <a
  href="http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>.
</p>

<p>
  There are simple autonomous mobiles that can wander about, and
  enough hooks that it's possible to get them to respond to reasonable
  stimuli.  Getting them to act reasonably is still in development,
  but the infrastructure is there.
</p>

<p>
  Portables can be gotten, dropped and generally manipulated.  They
  work fine as containers.  See the tutorials for examples of online
  creation.  Objects save and load happily in any topology, stacked to
  any depth, and there are permanent bodies and inventory.  Objects
  can have other objects as &quot;details&quot;, which allow you to
  examine an object or setting in many particulars.  All these objects
  have weight, volume and size, and capacities for same.  A full
  inheritance system lets these properties propagate automatically to
  child objects.
</p>

<p>
  There is a convenient online help system.  It reads directories
  recursively and registers online help files localized to any or all
  supported locales.  It does Soundex matching (only in English
  currently) for words without explicit help entries.  The help system
  is well populated and quite adequate to the needs of a starting MUD.
</p>

<p>
  Phantasmal is localized.  That means object and room descriptions
  use Phrase structures rather than simple strings so that any such
  description is automatically localizable to any supported language.
  Note that unicode characters are not yet supported.  Spanish is the
  only current suggested locale, and many messages still need to be
  localized.  It's a good test for the various systems nonetheless.
  Wish I was a better translator!
</p>

<p>
  In case of problems the binary port is still configured for
  emergency administrator login, and all the old wiz commands work
  just like the <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">unmodified Kernel
  MUDLib</a>.  On the regular port most of them have a % on the front,
  so they have names like %grant, %compile and so on.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a> files
  supply non-statedump structured data storage very similar to XML in
  many ways, including Document Type Definitions to simplify parsing.
  Localized structures and help files are stored this way.  The UNQ
  parsing system is doing well and supports backslash escaping but not
  (yet) markup.  UNQ Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are well
  supported and greatly aid parsing most of the objects that
  Phantasmal stores in files.
</p>

<p>
  There's a simple object manager to handle in-place upgrades.  This
  is one of the requirements for a persistent MUD.  The ObjectD uses
  DGD's lightweight objects (LWOs) to keep its footprint reasonable,
  and manages them heirarchically to permit future expansion to very
  large number of objects.  Its current form tracks objects but
  doesn't help with partial rebuilds, only whole-hog AUTO upgrades.
  Until Phantasmal gets significantly larger and/or slower that's
  unlikely to be a real problem.

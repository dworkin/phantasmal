    <h3 align="center"> Phantasmal's Current Features </h3>

    <font size="4">

    <p> Phantasmal builds on the code of the DGD Kernel MUDLib and
      borrows specific tricks and concepts from several other MUDLibs.
      Phantasmal means to be a standard library for certain game
      features like NPCs, rooms and details.  It's a good base to
      begin construction from, but not a full game by itself.  There's
      a game library called TestGame in CVS and with Bundled Phantasmal
      which makes a fine example of how Phantasmal can be turned into
      a normal game. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal is currently working to allow old-style LPC objects
      and other objects with code that isn't much like the current
      default.  It has recently added scripts, and needs to integrate
      them into more of what it does.  It has added tags, which are
      arbitrary object properties necessary to make scripts useful.
      </p>

    <p> Phantasmal allows logins and talking, chatting on channels and
      emote.
      There's a SoulD to handle social commands (like giggle, burp and
      so on).
      The usual basic MUD
      commands for playing with objects, containers and rooms are
      implemented.  There's a quite
      usable set of Online Creation (OLC) commands which allow an
      administrator to create and destroy rooms, portables and exits
      and set their various attributes.  It uses a set of object
      descriptions inspired by Skotos'
      series of Building Blocks
      <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>. </p>

    <p> There are simple autonomous mobiles that can wander about, and
      enough hooks that it's possible to get them to respond to
      reasonable stimuli.  Getting them to act reasonably is still in
      development, but the infrastructure is there. </p>

    <p> Portables can be gotten, dropped and generally manipulated.
      They work fine as containers.  See the tutorials for examples
      of online creation.  Objects save and load happily in any
      topology, stacked to any depth, and there are permanent
      bodies and inventory. </p>

    <p> There is a convenient online help system.  It reads directories
      recursively and registers online help files localized to any
      or all supported locales.  It does Soundex
      matching (only in English currently) for words without explicit
      help
      entries.  The help system is well populated and quite
      adequate
      to the needs of a starting MUD. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal is localized.  That means object and room
      descriptions use Phrase
      structures rather than simple strings so that any such description
      is automatically localizable to any supported language.  Note
      that unicode characters are not yet supported.  Spanish is the
      only current suggested locale, and many
      messages still need to be localized.  It's a good test
      for the various systems nonetheless.  Wish I was a
      better translator! </p>

    <p> In case of problems the binary port is still
      configured for emergency administrator login, and all the old
      wiz commands work just like the
      <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">unmodified Kernel MUDLib</a>.
      Normally (on the regular port) most of them have a % on the
      front, so they have names like %grant, %compile and so on. </p>

    <p> <a href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a>
      files supply non-statedump structured data storage very
      similar to XML in many ways, including Document Type Definitions
      to simplify parsing.  Localized structures and help
      files are stored this way.  The UNQ parsing system is doing
      well and supports backslash escaping but not (yet) markup.
      UNQ Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are
      well supported and greatly aid parsing most of the
      objects that Phantasmal stores in files. </p>

    <p> There's a simple object manager
      to handle in-place upgrades.  This is
      one of the requirements for a persistent MUD.
      The ObjectD uses
      DGD's lightweight objects (LWOs) to keep its footprint reasonable,
      and manages them heirarchically to permit future expansion to
      very large number of objects.  Its current form tracks
      objects but doesn't help with partial rebuilds, only
      whole-hog AUTO upgrades.  Until Phantasmal gets significantly
      larger that's unlikely to be a real problem. </p>

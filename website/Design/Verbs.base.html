<h2>Verbs for Mobile Actions</h2>

<p>For each <a href="MobAction.html">Mobile Action</a> that is to
be executed, there must be an action structure, which encapsulates
the basic action, and a set of parameters of that action.</p>

<p>Every action has an actor - that is, it is performed <i>by</i>
some mobile. It may have one or more direct objects which can be
mobiles or non-sentient objects. For instance, the "take" action
will operate on a single object (which may be sentient or not).
Movement actions ("move north") will have a direction as an
argument. Communication actions will have what to communicate, and
possibly who to communicate it to.</p>

<p>A given mobile is permitted to override any verb it is to
perform. That is, a "black bear" mobile type may override the
movement operation to leave bear footprints, or to growl
periodically, or whatever is deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>A mobile can perceive when another mobile near it is about to
perform an action. Phantasmal permits the mobile to notice the
pending action and prevent it.</p>

<p>Different actions will notify different locations when they are
pending. For instance, a movement action will notify the location
from which the mobile is moving, and the new location <i>to</i>
which it is moving. A mobile in either location can prevent the
movement if it wishes. A communication action will notify the room
from which the communication is occurring, and possibly also a
wider area in some cases. In every case, the room where the mobile
is taking action will be notified.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile A sends out notification of pending action Move(north)
  to room MyRoom</li>

  <li>Mobile B is in MyRoom, and receives notification that A is
  about to move north</li>

  <li>Mobile B is blocking the north exit, and returns a value to
  Phantasmal indicating that the action is not permitted, and
  should be cancelled.</li>

  <li>Mobile A is told that his action has been prevented by Mobile
  B.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a specific action to occur, there are several notifications
that go out. The first notification tells nearby actors that the
action is preparing to take place, and gives them a chance to
prevent it. The second notification indicates that the action will
take place, and may not be cancelled. The third notification is to
indicate that the action has successfully completed. In each case,
the action structure will be sent out with the notification.</p>

<p>It may be useful to have a specific Phantasmal-based game be
able to categorize 'subscriptions' to these events, since the game
will potentially alter what verbs notify what areas, and may have
particular kinds of events that are never subscribed to, or
otherwise highly optimizable. That is beyond the current scope of
this document.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Verbs for Mobile Actions</h3>

<p>For each <a href="MobAction.html">Mobile Action</a> that is to be
executed, there must be an action structure, which encapsulates the
basic action, and a set of parameters of that action.</p>

<p>Every action has an actor - that is, it is performed <i>by</i> some
mobile. It may have one or more direct objects which can be mobiles or
non-sentient objects. For instance, the "take" action will operate on a
single object (which may be sentient or not). Movement actions ("move
north") will have a direction as an argument. Communication actions will
have what to communicate, and possibly who to communicate it to.</p>

<p>A given mobile is permitted to override any verb it is to perform.
That is, a "black bear" mobile type may override the movement operation
to leave bear footprints, or to growl periodically, or whatever is
deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>A mobile can perceive when another mobile near it is about to perform
an action. Phantasmal permits the mobile to notice the pending action
and prevent it.</p>

<p>Different actions will notify different locations when they are
pending. For instance, a movement action will notify the location from
which the mobile is moving, and the new location <i>to</i> which it is
moving. A mobile in either location can prevent the movement if it
wishes. A communication action will notify the room from which the
communication is occurring, and possibly also a wider area in some
cases. In every case, the room where the mobile is taking action will be
notified.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile A sends out notification of pending action Move(north) to
  room MyRoom</li>

  <li>Mobile B is in MyRoom, and receives notification that A is about
  to move north</li>

  <li>Mobile B is blocking the north exit, and returns a value to
  Phantasmal indicating that the action is not permitted, and should be
  cancelled.</li>

  <li>Mobile A is told that his action has been prevented by Mobile
  B.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a specific action to occur, there are several notifications that
go out. The first notification tells nearby actors that the action is
preparing to take place, and gives them a chance to prevent it. The
second notification indicates that the action will take place, and may
not be cancelled. The third notification is to indicate that the action
has successfully completed. In each case, the action structure will be
sent out with the notification.</p>

<p>It may be useful to have a specific Phantasmal-based game be able to
categorize 'subscriptions' to these events, since the game will
potentially alter what verbs notify what areas, and may have particular
kinds of events that are never subscribed to, or otherwise highly
optimizable. That is beyond the current scope of this document.</p>

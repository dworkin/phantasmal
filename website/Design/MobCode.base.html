<h2>Coding Phantasmal Mobiles</h2>

<p>Code for mobiles in Phantasmal should obey some basic
guidelines.</p>

<p>Phantasmal has a <a href="Verbs.html">process to allow mobiles
to prevent other mobiles from taking actions</a>. Make sure your
action plays nice with this process. Make sure your action is
appropriately preventable and doesn't try to get around the usual
process.</p>

<p>Just as your mobile's actions should be preventable with the
normal Phantasmal prevention process (which has priority over it),
it should also play nice with the processes that are
lower-priority. Make sure that your action can be prevented on
certain objects, mobiles or locations so that if somebody wants to
override your action for plot reasons, that can be done. Tags can
be a great way to do this.</p>

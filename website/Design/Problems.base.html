<h2>Potential Design Issues</h2>

<p><i>(all griping courtesy of Shentino)</i></p>

<p>I don't really like the flatness of Phantasmal's "zoning". How
do you handle countries, cities with buildings, and ships with
multiple rooms? Consider that a large town may have a bazillion
buildings, each with their own rooms.</p>

<p>Segment numbers and object numbers are IMHO too rigid.</p>

<p>Zones should be less rigid. Objects can move around.</p>

<p>Some heirarchy would help keep things better organized in a very
large mud. A "general" should be able to supervise a large area,
with "lieutenants" covering smaller areas if they so desire.</p>

<p>I'll know for sure once I learn the current system.</p>

<h3>Design issues</h3>

<p>I don't really like the flatness of Phantasmal's "zoning".  How do
you handle countries, cities with buildings, and ships with multiple
rooms?  Consider that a large town may have a bazillion buildings, each
with their own rooms.</p>

<p>Objects should be given a standard serial number, randomly generated. 
I don't like the binding between object number and segment number.</p>

<p>Zones should be less rigid.  Objects can move around.</p>

<p>Some heirarchy would help keep things better organized in a very
large mud.  A "general" should be able to supervise a large area, with
"lieutenants" covering smaller areas if they so desire.</p>

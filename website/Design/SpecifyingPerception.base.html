@@TITLE Specifying Perception@@

<h2>Specifying Perceptual Thresholds</h2>

<p>In our hypothetical perfect version of Phantasmal, <a href=
"Visibility.html">visibility</a> is a tremendously important and
involved thing. There's a lot to it.</p>

<p>Perception is determined by the character and the game engine.
Whether there is a single 'Perception' characteristic which
determines the character's acuity in all senses or a tremendously
involved and detailed set of skills for many different situations
and senses, still the game engine will eventually come up with a
number representing the player's perceptiveness in that sense, at
that given time, in that exact situation.</p>

<p>The game engine will also need to figure out how to determine
the difficulty of perceiving an event in its specific sense. For
instance, an ant's movements might be visible to somebody
searching, or who had very good eyesight - how visible? A number
must be assigned somehow. This document attempts to answer the
question of how that number should be assigned, and how the game
engine will process the results in different situations.</p>

<h3>Audibility</h3>

<p>Sound is relatively easy, so I'll address it first. Let's assume
that the basic audibility number is about how loud a sound is.
Normally a high value for perception is considered a good thing,
and means the character is likely to be successful. So let's treat
a high perception value as meaning the character can hear very soft
sounds, and a high difficulty number as meaning the sound is very
soft and hard to hear.</p>

<p>Let's say that a sound with twice the difficulty to hear is half
as loud. So a sound with a difficulty of 2 is half the volume in
decibels of a sound with a difficulty of 1, and twice the volume of
a sound with a difficulty of 4. For the mathematically inclined,
that means that the volume in decibels is equal to 1 over the
difficulty number times some constant.</p>

<p>In a space full of air with no other objects, you'd expect that
being twice as far from a sound would make it one-quarter as loud
(the inverse square law), or four times the difficulty number.
However, in a real setting, you'll find that sound (like light)
bounces off things, so the real falloff of light is more like one
over the distance than one over the distance squared. So being
twice as far away would mean being half as loud.</p>

<p>So here's what we need to know for sound... We may need to know
how far away a thing is &mdash; just in case we need to do some
kind of weird falloff. We need to know about how much sound is
absorbed over a particular distance, from room to room. We need to
know how loud (perceptible) the original sound is. Between those
things, we pretty much have all we need.</p>

<h3>Vision and Light</h3>

<p>Everything we said about sound holds pretty true for light, but
vision and light behave differently from each other. Light, like
sound, could be measured on a difficulty curve where being twice as
high a difficulty means half as much light. But vision is harder to
measure reasonably.</p>

<p>Light attenuates over distance &mdash; that is, a torch that is
in a wall sconce fifty feet away won't provide nearly as much light
as one right next to you. Like sound, it attenuates approximately
linearly if you're indoors &mdash; being twice as far away means
you get about half as much light. If you're outdoors in a big clear
area you're more likely to get inverse square behavior, so being
twice as far away means you get one fourth as much light. We'll
ignore that for now. Still, it's all pretty much the same way that
sound works.</p>

<p>Vision, however, is not the same as light. Vision includes not
only whether you can see something at all, but how much detail you
can see. If the torch is too far away, you can light somebody up
with a lamp right next to them. However, if they're too far away,
you can't do much to fix seeing the <i>details</i> without a
telescope (note: a telescope would probably count here as
increasing a player's perception). If you see somebody reflected in
a funhouse mirror, you're getting all the light reflected
perfectly, but you'll still get reduced vision.</p>

<p>Vision is harder to measure mathematically. You can measure
sound in decibels and light in candlepower, but there's not really
any measurement of how clearly you can see details. Obviously
distance and intervening obstacles can change visibility &mdash;
think of seeing somebody through a thin hedge or a thick fog for a
moment. But it's not clear how to measure that. Do you measure
based on how much of them you can see? The funhouse mirror wouldn't
reduce that at all, yet it still makes it harder to figure out what
they look like. Do you measure by how distorted they are? The fog
wouldn't do much anything to that, but it certainly reduces
detail.</p>

<p>The short answer to all these questions is "yes". Yes, we'll
count visibility as being reduced if you can see less of the
person. Yes, we'll count it as reduced if they're distorted. Once
we figure out how much light we have on them, we'll reduce
visibility if they're in the dark (note that it doesn't matter
whether <i>we</i> are in the dark while trying to see them. If
they're lit up and we're standing a hundred feet away in the dark,
we can still see <i>them</i> just fine).</p>

<p>Let's think about visibility in terms of seeing a red square.
You'd like to be able to see it as being the right size, as being a
square, and as being red. Anything that makes it harder to tell any
of those things will reduce visibility. Distance will make the
square look half as tall when you get twice as far away, so if
everything else is perfectly the same, being twice as far away will
make the difficulty of seeing something twice as great. However,
additional factors like darkness, fog and obstacles will certainly
reduce visibility even farther if they are present.</p>

<h3>Vibration</h3>

<p>It's easy to tell how touch and taste are affected by distance.
If something isn't directly in contact with you, you can't touch or
taste it. Temperature and smell propagate, but you still only
notice the smell or temperature of the place you're in, even if
heat or stench slowly drifts in from the next room.</p>

<p>However, vibration is a bit different. Vibration travels through
the air and the ground. It includes sound, sort of, but even a deaf
person can feel vibration through the ground, and vibration through
the ground is definitely more felt than heard.</p>

<p>Vibration normally travels in an expanding circle along the
ground, so its power will be diffused into a linearly-larger area.
That is, a circle with twice the diameter is twice as far around.
However, it's possible that spreading into a sphere underground,
which I assume vibration does, will make it more of an inverse
square thing like sound or light. So, like sound or light, seems
like vibration is sometimes linear falloff and sometimes
inverse-square falloff. On this one, I have no real data so I'm
just guessing.</p>

<h3>Propagating Smells and Temperatures</h3>

<p>Some things, like smells and temperatures, are carried by air
and slowly diffuse through it. They tend to spread slowly, or be
carried by the wind.</p>

<p>Currently there is no wind in Phantasmal, though you could
extend this stuff to include it without too terribly much trouble.
So let's talk about the propagation of smells and temperatures in
approximately still air. This assumes normal breezes and so on, but
no significant overall wind direction.</p>

<p>We'll actually want to know about how big an area is for this
one. A very large area with a high temperature or an intense smell
will cause a lot more heat or smell in surrounding areas than a
small area with the same intensity. That doesn't mean that if you
want a smell to spread you should light your incense in a big room.
It means that your incense will make a much less intense odor in a
big room because there's a lot more air to soak up the smell.</p>

<p>Remember that with smell, outdoor areas will tend to get rid of
some of it entirely. There's a whole upper atmosphere for your
smell to diffuse into that may not be modeled as explicit MUD
areas, but it certainly exists. That means that a certain
percentage of the smell in any given room will disappear through an
extra virtual exit and never come back. Temperature is likely to be
similar - outdoor rooms will be naturally temperature-regulated to
some degree, and the heat will naturally trend toward the
prevailing outdoor temperature. Heat, in fact, will have a similar
effect indoors - the stone, dirt, wood or other wall material will
have its own temperature, and it will radiate some of it into the
air.</p>

<p>You'll also lose a bit of smell indoors to 'settling' - some
odors, like smoke or incense, tend to be heavier than air and the
particles are prone to settle out of the air and stop being
smellable. Others are lighter than air, but still manage to layer
themselves on the walls or ceiling, which naturally causes the odor
to disappear from the air. Some smells are more easily dispersed
than others in this way. Heavy particulate like smoke tends to
disappear very quickly, but may leave a smell on nearby items. It's
not clear whether Phantasmal can or should model the 'leave a smell
on nearby items' behavior since that seems to behave differently
than normal smell propagation.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Specifying Perceptual Thresholds</h3>

<p>In our hypothetical perfect version of Phantasmal, <a href=
"Visibility.html">visibility</a> is a tremendously important and
involved thing. There's a lot to it.</p>

<p>Perception is determined by the character and the game engine.
Whether there is a single 'Perception' characteristic which determines
the character's acuity in all senses or a tremendously involved and
detailed set of skills for many different situations and senses, still
the game engine will eventually come up with a number representing the
player's perceptiveness in that sense, at that given time, in that exact
situation.</p>

<p>The game engine will also need to figure out how to determine the
difficulty of perceiving an event in its specific sense. For instance,
an ant's movements might be visible to somebody searching, or who had
very good eyesight - how visible? A number must be assigned somehow.
This document attempts to answer the question of how that number should
be assigned, and how the game engine will process the results in
different situations.</p>

<h3>Audibility</h3>

<p>Sound is relatively easy, so I'll address it first. Let's assume that
the basic audibility number is about how loud a sound is. Normally a
high value for perception is considered a good thing, and means the
character is likely to be successful. So let's treat a high perception
value as meaning the character can hear very soft sounds, and a high
difficulty number as meaning the sound is very soft and hard to
hear.</p>

<p>Let's say that a sound with twice the difficulty to hear is half as
loud. So a sound with a difficulty of 2 is half the volume in decibels
of a sound with a difficulty of 1, and twice the volume of a sound with
a difficulty of 4. For the mathematically inclined, that means that the
volume in decibels is equal to 1 over the difficulty number times some
constant.</p>

<p>In a space full of air with no other objects, you'd expect that being
twice as far from a sound would make it one-quarter as loud (the inverse
square law), or four times the difficulty number. However, in a real
setting, you'll find that sound (like light) bounces off things, so the
real falloff of light is more like one over the distance than one over
the distance squared. So being twice as far away would mean being half
as loud.</p>

<p>So here's what we need to know for sound... We may need to know how
far away a thing is &mdash; just in case we need to do some kind of
weird falloff. We need to know about how much sound is absorbed over a
particular distance, from room to room. We need to know how loud
(perceptible) the original sound is. Between those things, we pretty
much have all we need.</p>

<h3>Vision and Light</h3>

<p>Everything we said about sound holds pretty true for light, but
vision and light behave differently from each other. Light, like sound,
could be measured on a difficulty curve where being twice as high a
difficulty means half as much light. But vision is harder to measure
reasonably.</p>

<p>Light attenuates over distance &mdash; that is, a torch that is in a
wall sconce fifty feet away won't provide nearly as much light as one
right next to you. Like sound, it attenuates approximately linearly if
you're indoors &mdash; being twice as far away means you get about half
as much light. If you're outdoors in a big clear area you're more likely
to get inverse square behavior, so being twice as far away means you get
one fourth as much light. We'll ignore that for now. Still, it's all
pretty much the same way that sound works.</p>

<p>Vision, however, is not the same as light. Vision includes not only
whether you can see something at all, but how much detail you can see.
If the torch is too far away, you can light somebody up with a lamp
right next to them. However, if they're too far away, you can't do much
to fix seeing the <i>details</i> without a telescope (note: a telescope
would probably count here as increasing a player's perception). If you
see somebody reflected in a funhouse mirror, you're getting all the
light reflected perfectly, but you'll still get reduced vision.</p>

<p>Vision is harder to measure mathematically. You can measure sound in
decibels and light in candlepower, but there's not really any
measurement of how clearly you can see details. Obviously distance and
intervening obstacles can change visibility &mdash; think of seeing
somebody through a thin hedge or a thick fog for a moment. But it's not
clear how to measure that. Do you measure based on how much of them you
can see? The funhouse mirror wouldn't reduce that at all, yet it still
makes it harder to figure out what they look like. Do you measure by how
distorted they are? The fog wouldn't do much anything to that, but it
certainly reduces detail.</p>

<p>The short answer to all these questions is "yes". Yes, we'll count
visibility as being reduced if you can see less of the person. Yes,
we'll count it as reduced if they're distorted. Once we figure out how
much light we have on them, we'll reduce visibility if they're in the
dark (note that it doesn't matter whether <i>we</i> are in the dark
while trying to see them. If they're lit up and we're standing a hundred
feet away in the dark, we can still see <i>them</i> just fine).</p>

<p>Let's think about visibility in terms of seeing a red square. You'd
like to be able to see it as being the right size, as being a square,
and as being red. Anything that makes it harder to tell any of those
things will reduce visibility. Distance will make the square look half
as tall when you get twice as far away, so if everything else is
perfectly the same, being twice as far away will make the difficulty of
seeing something twice as great. However, additional factors like
darkness, fog and obstacles will certainly reduce visibility even
farther if they are present.</p>

<h3>Vibration</h3>

<p>It's easy to tell how touch and taste are affected by distance. If
something isn't directly in contact with you, you can't touch or taste
it. Temperature and smell propagate, but you still only notice the smell
or temperature of the place you're in, even if heat or stench slowly
drifts in from the next room.</p>

<p>However, vibration is a bit different. Vibration travels through the
air and the ground. It includes sound, sort of, but even a deaf person
can feel vibration through the ground, and vibration through the ground
is definitely more felt than heard.</p>

<p>Vibration normally travels in an expanding circle along the ground,
so its power will be diffused into a linearly-larger area. That is, a
circle with twice the diameter is twice as far around. However, it's
possible that spreading into a sphere underground, which I assume
vibration does, will make it more of an inverse square thing like sound
or light. So, like sound or light, seems like vibration is sometimes
linear falloff and sometimes inverse-square falloff. On this one, I have
no real data so I'm just guessing.</p>

<h3>Propagating Smells and Temperatures</h3>

<p>Some things, like smells and temperatures, are carried by air and
slowly diffuse through it. They tend to spread slowly, or be carried by
the wind.</p>

<p>Currently there is no wind in Phantasmal, though you could extend
this stuff to include it without too terribly much trouble. So let's
talk about the propagation of smells and temperatures in approximately
still air. This assumes normal breezes and so on, but no significant
overall wind direction.</p>

<p>We'll actually want to know about how big an area is for this one. A
very large area with a high temperature or an intense smell will cause a
lot more heat or smell in surrounding areas than a small area with the
same intensity. That doesn't mean that if you want a smell to spread you
should light your incense in a big room. It means that your incense will
make a much less intense odor in a big room because there's a lot more
air to soak up the smell.</p>

<p>Remember that with smell, outdoor areas will tend to get rid of some
of it entirely. There's a whole upper atmosphere for your smell to
diffuse into that may not be modeled as explicit MUD areas, but it
certainly exists. That means that a certain percentage of the smell in
any given room will disappear through an extra virtual exit and never
come back. Temperature is likely to be similar - outdoor rooms will be
naturally temperature-regulated to some degree, and the heat will
naturally trend toward the prevailing outdoor temperature. Heat, in
fact, will have a similar effect indoors - the stone, dirt, wood or
other wall material will have its own temperature, and it will radiate
some of it into the air.</p>

<p>You'll also lose a bit of smell indoors to 'settling' - some odors,
like smoke or incense, tend to be heavier than air and the particles are
prone to settle out of the air and stop being smellable. Others are
lighter than air, but still manage to layer themselves on the walls or
ceiling, which naturally causes the odor to disappear from the air. Some
smells are more easily dispersed than others in this way. Heavy
particulate like smoke tends to disappear very quickly, but may leave a
smell on nearby items. It's not clear whether Phantasmal can or should
model the 'leave a smell on nearby items' behavior since that seems to
behave differently than normal smell propagation.</p>

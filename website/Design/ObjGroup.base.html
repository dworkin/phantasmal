<h2>Object Grouping for Phantasmal, Speculations</h2>

<p>We'd like to have objects group up when they're all in the same
area. For instance, if you drop seventeen mixed swords in a pile in
the middle of the floor, we'd like to see a "pile of swords" rather
than each one having its own entry. As we add opportunity for
object customization (wear and tear, difference in manufacture,
varying styles), this will get even more important.</p>

<p>A first, simple cut at the problem would simply use a single
inheritance heirarchy, and each node could be marked with whether
it could be used as a player-visible grouping -- "sword" would be a
good one, but "iron object" would need to be marked as not
player-visible, or perhaps simply given a fudge factor such that it
wouldn't often be used.</p>

<p>However, we'd like to have multiple inheritance, not just single
inheritance. A group of a shovel, ten hoes, a wheelbarrow, a
thresher, and a pickaxe might be characterized by either "some farm
equipment, a wheelbarrow and a pickaxe" or "some tools, a
wheelbarrow and a thresher". Conceivably it could also be "some
metal objects", but that's not very descriptive, so again, the
"metal objects" group would be non-player-visible, or tagged such
that it was very rarely chosen.</p>

<p>The problem with multiple inheritance is choosing how to
characterize a group of objects, and doing so quite quickly. Bear
in mind that two different characters (with different fields of
view from their two locations) might see these objects differently.
For instance, one might not see the thresher from his point of view
in the hayloft, while the other might not see the pickaxe from
outside the door. This group of objects (sometimes including the
pickaxe and thresher) will have to <i>simultaneously</i> be "some
farm equipment and a wheelbarrow" and "some tools and a
wheelbarrow". That suggests that we need some kind of caching
scheme in which we can quickly run over the structures for multiple
groups of objects and determine a description.</p>

<p>One example scheme: for every group of four or more objects in a
single location, make a group accounting object. This doesn't have
to be an object in the MUD sense, but the location containing the
objects must be able to easily find and use it. This group
accounting object (GAO) will lazily categorize the objects into the
group heirarchy when requested to. It must be very quick to merge
two or more of these GAOs into a new combined GAO -- for instance,
the GAOs for the hayloft, the main floor of the barn and the area
just outside the barn door will frequently be merged because they
will frequently be visible from the same locations.</p>

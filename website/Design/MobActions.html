  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Player and Mobile Actions </h3>

  <p>
    In a game where you have players, mobiles and objects separated as Phantasmal
    separates them, there is necessarily a heirarchy of action types.  There are
    'actions' in the sense of events, as described
    <a href="Actions.html">elsewhere</a>.  There are also voluntary player and
    mobile actions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some commands that a player enters change the MUD's interface to the player.
    For instance, setting the preferred output language, or the number of columns
    or rows on the player's display, has no analog in the MUD world.  It simply
    alters the player's interface.  These will be called &quot;pure player
    commands&quot;.
  </p>

  <p>
    Commands that can conceivably be executed by any mobile are more common.  For
    instance, movement, gossip or chat, combat, or manipulating items are all
    quite well-defined even if done by a non-player character, though not all
    of these actions may be possible for all non-player characters.  Phantasmal
    should have the ability to execute any of these actions for any mobile, though
    the result may be an irate message in the system log.
  </p>

  <p>
    There should be a command structure to encapsulate a request for such a
    mobile action, so that a character may go through a string of such
    requests, in order, possibly with scripts running in between.  The
    command structure can be instantiated by the command parser (if a
    player types a text command) or by a script or other interface, which
    need not use the same syntax.  Having this queue of mobile actions for
    a given mobile also makes it reasonable to add delays or other side
    effects to prevent players (or mobiles) from being able to execute
    commands as quickly as they can type.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that pure player commands do <i>not</i> have an entry in the
    queue of mobile actions.  Pure player commands are executed instantly,
    but they should also have no significant effect on the game world.
    The player can change from having a display in English to one in
    Spanish as many times per second as he likes without it being in any
    way exploitable.

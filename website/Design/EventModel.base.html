<h2>Continuous and Combinable Events in a Text-Based
Environment</h2>

<h2>What Types of Events Are There?</h2>

<p>'Events', in this context, indicate perceptible things that
happen. If a character's stomach growls, or a gnat begins to fly to
the west, or the earth rumbles, that may be an event.</p>

<h3>Instant and Timed Events</h3>

<p>Many events will be <em>instant</em>. That is to say, they will
take place at a very specific, well-defined moment in time. While
their effects may continue for longer, the event will occur and be
perceived very specifically at that moment. For instance, the
firing of a cannon could easily be represented as an
<em>instant</em> event.</p>

<p>Some events take place over a period of time. They generally
(though not always) have a set, specific beginning and a set,
specific end. Unlike <em>instant</em> events, these <em>timed</em>
events can be occurring for a particular interval. If one checks
periodically (perhaps with a "look" or "listen" command) one can
perceive some set of timed events that are currently in progress.
One could thus consider descriptions of characters and objects to
be special cases of timed events. However, instant events are
normally perceived only once (if at all), at the specific moment
when they actually occur.</p>

<h3>The Five Senses</h3>

<p>Something that is conceptually a single event, such as a cannon
firing, often consists of perceptible phenomena in more than one
sense. For instance, the cannon's firing will include a loud
(audible) report, but also a (visible) flash from the powder, a
(tactile) vibration through the earth, and perhaps even a
(smellable, tastable) tang in the air from the explosion. Then,
timed events may follow as the smoke slowly rises and
disperses.</p>

<h3>Composite Events</h3>

<p>As the preceding example shows, it can be difficult to
distinguish individual events from each other. For narrative
purposes, a barrage of cannonfire may act as a single event, but it
may be broken down into multiple. This is especially important when
different senses may be affected differently - a cannon barrage may
be felt and heard but not seen if a wall is in between, or if it
takes place on a dark night. They may be felt and seen but not
heard by a deaf cannoneer! These sub-events may be noticed
separately from each other, and so should be separable, at least in
some cases.</p>

<h3>Levels of Perception and Perceptibility</h3>

<p>Some events, like an earthquake, are so important, powerful and
perceptible that it is almost inconceivable that one could be
nearby and not notice them. Some, such as a gnat shifting position,
are so nearly imperceptible that one would have to be in precisely
the right location and have very good powers of perception to have
a chance of noticing.</p>

<p>An event's <em>perceptibility</em> is how noticeable it is. An
earthquake, a cannon's firing and the roar of a waterfall all have
a high <em>perceptibility</em>. A small motion like a gnat's
flight, or a quiet sound, will have a low <em>perceptibility</em>.
<em>Perceptibility</em> may behave differently for different
senses. It will usually attenuate with distance. It may be affected
by other factors like background noise or how light or dark an area
is.</p>

<p><em>Perception</em> is measured against <em>perceptibility</em>,
and on the same scale. Somebody's <em>perception</em> indicates how
good they are at the indicated form of awareness (sight, sound,
smell, etc), and how much attention they are currently paying. For
instance, being in combat will normally lower one's effective
<em>perception</em>, as will specifically concentrating on some
other sense or location than the one being checked.</p>

<h3>Variably-Perceived Events</h3>

<p>Some events may have multiple descriptions, depending on how
perceptible they are, how close to the event one is, and other
factors. For instance, the cannon's firing may be deafening up
close, but distant or echoing if you're farther away. A character
with a lot of knowledge or very good eyesight may discover
different things on an ancient vase than a less knowledgeable or
less perceptive character. The same factors that reduce perception
(distance, light, background noise) will tend to have variable
descriptions associated with them. In addition, many other game
specific factors (season, knowledge skills, character class) may
potentially have an effect.</p>

<h4>Virtual Events</h4>

<p>In some cases, a repeatable description may change, with or
without notifying the player (or character). For instance, if a
Paladin is able to detect evil, his description of a scene may
include a phrase like "Morford the Silly is here. A green aura of
neutrality surrounds him." If Morford proceeds to perform some
incredibly virtuous action and the Paladin looks around again, he
may see "Morford the Silly is here. A white aura of beatific
goodness surrounds him."</p>

<p>An advanced game may remark on the difference along with
Morford's action: "Morford restores a lollipop to its rightful
owner, a virtuous street urchin. Morford now glows with a white
aura of beatific goodness!" However, in a less advanced engine, the
description will change but the player will not be notified. If the
player wishes to see Morford's new status, he or she will need to
look around again. We refer to this as a <em>virtual</em> event.
Conceptually it is an event, but it has no direct representation in
the game engine.</p>

<h2>A Structure for In-Game Events</h2>

<h3>Instant Events</h3>

<p>A given <em>instant</em> event will need to exist in one or more
specific senses, or be explicitly declared to be in multiple. It
must be possible for it to be a <em>composite</em> event. For each
sense in which the event exists, there must be a perceptibility
threshold (the perception is a function of the player, and
attenuating the perception or perceptibility is done by the game
engine). So, a given <em>instant</em> event's event structure will
consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text description (an ASCII string or other text
  description)</li>

  <li>Perceptibility (an integer, generally)</li>

  <li>What sense (an enumeration)</li>

  <li>Sub-events (a list of event structures)</li>
</ul>

<p>If an event consists of sub-events, it is assumed that those
sub-events are, collectively, equal to the event itself. That is,
if the text of the event itself is shown, then the player should be
getting the equivalent of all the sub-events. Similarly, if every
sub-event can be perceived, the game engine should be willing and
able to show the top event as a summary of all sub-events
together.</p>

<p>The event will be labelled with a sense. Those senses will
probably include the ordinary five, but may also include fantasy
senses like ESP and nonstandard sense descriptions like
"temperature" for game reasons. For instance, temperature will
propagate differently over distance than vibration, and direct
touch won't propagate over distance at all - but all three of these
are usually lumped together into the sense of touch. The game
engine will need to know which of these things an event is to know
what to do with it. In addition, the event may be labelled as being
no sense at all. In that case, the event will be displayed if and
only if all of its sub-events can be perceived. In other words, it
is as though the perceptibility threshold was set to be entirely
imperceptible - see the paragraph about an event being equivalant
to its sub-events for why these two things behave identically.</p>

<h3>Timed Events</h3>

<p>Timed events, those that have duration, build on the structure
of instant events. A timed event may have optional instant events
for their beginning and ending. For instance, if a metronome begins
ticking, the starting event may say, "the metronome begins its
monotonous clacking", the timed event may say "the metronome is
ticking", and the ending event may say "the metronome halts its
ticking and is silent".</p>

<p>Unlike the beginning and ending events, the timed event is
perceptible for a noticeable amount of time. A player might type
"listen" and receive the message about the metronome during an hour
or more when it has begun but not yet ended.</p>

<p>A timed event structure will include everything that the instant
event structure does. If the two are combined into a single
structure, there will also be a field to tell whether the event is
instant or timed. In addition, the timed structure will include the
following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A beginning event (optional, an event structure)</li>

  <li>An ending event (optional, an event structure)</li>

  <li>A start time (optional, a time in the game engine's
  format)</li>

  <li>An ending time (optional, a time in the game engine's
  format)</li>
</ul>

<p>The beginning and ending events are perceptible
<strong>only</strong> if the timed event is perceived. So no matter
how easy they are to perceive on their own, if the event itself is
not perceived, the beginning and ending events will not be
perceived. This prevents a character noticing the beginning of the
metronome's ticking, but then being unable to hear it until it
ceases.</p>

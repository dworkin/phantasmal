<h2>Dependencies for Phantasmal Building</h2>

<p>There are many and various features and components that can or could
be built for Phantasmal. Good questions include "which ones first?" It's
useful for us to look at what features enable what other features, and
what features will have a <i>lot</i> of previous work necessary to even
begin them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile action system - all actions should exist as modular
  'action' objects so that they can easily be generated by scripts and
  alternate parsers, and just 'submitted' as attempted actions for a
  mobile to undertake.</li>

  <li>Events - anything that occurs in the game world exists as an
  'event' structure, with a location, actor and so on. This makes it
  easier for mobiles and objects to respond to them.</li>

  <li>More Room Linkage - it should be possible to perceive actions
  occurring in specific other rooms. Initially, a character will see
  actions there as if they were occurring in the current room but with a
  prefix of some kind. Later, there will be more discrimination.</li>

  <li>Sensory propagation - all events can occur over some range, such
  as being able to hear a sound in the next room or see somebody at a
  distance. Requires More Room Linkage. Requires Events for some
  functionality.</li>
</ul>

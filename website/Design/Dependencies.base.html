<h2>Dependencies for Phantasmal Building</h2>

<p>There are many and various features and components that can or
could be built for Phantasmal. Good questions include "which ones
first?" It's useful for us to look at what features enable what
other features, and what features will have a <i>lot</i> of
previous work necessary to even begin them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile action system - all actions should exist as modular
  'action' objects so that they can easily be generated by scripts
  and alternate parsers, and just 'submitted' as attempted actions
  for a mobile to undertake.</li>

  <li>Events - anything that occurs in the game world exists as an
  'event' structure, with a location, actor and so on. This makes
  it easier for mobiles and objects to respond to them.</li>

  <li>More Room Linkage - it should be possible to perceive actions
  occurring in specific other rooms. Initially, a character will
  see actions there as if they were occurring in the current room
  but with a prefix of some kind. Later, there will be more
  discrimination.</li>

  <li>Sensory propagation - all events can occur over some range,
  such as being able to hear a sound in the next room or see
  somebody at a distance. Requires More Room Linkage. Requires
  Events for some functionality.</li>
</ul>

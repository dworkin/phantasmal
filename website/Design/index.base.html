<h1>Phantasmal - Some Day</h1>

<p>Every so often, a good idea slides by me and I think, "hey! That
should go into Phantasmal!". Such ideas accumulate here as I write
them up in enough detail to remember them later and use them if I'm
so inclined.</p>

<h3>Designing for (Eventual) Phantasmal - Visibility, Actions and
Events</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Various mostly-original speculations on <a href=
  "ObjGroup.html">Object Grouping</a> and its relatives.</li>

  <li>Speculations on <a href="ClassHeirarchy.html">Class
  Heirarchy</a> and how it affects other aspects of the MUD.</li>

  <li>Speculations on <a href="Visibility.html">Visibility</a> in
  the MUD, including details on perception, object grouping and
  event grouping.</li>

  <li><a href="Actions.html">Actions and Events</a>, and how
  Phantasmal might deal with them.</li>

  <li><a href="EventModel.html">Phantasmal's Event Model</a>,
  further pondering.</li>

  <li><a href="SpecifyingPerception.html">Propagation of sound,
  light, temperature, smell, etc</a> in terms of perceptual
  thresholds and difficulty.</li>

  <li><a href="Terminology.html">Terms when referring to various
  occurrences</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Designing for Phantasmal - Precedence of Scripted Object
Actions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="MobActions.html">Player and Mobile Actions</a></li>

  <li><a href="Verbs.html">Verbs, Notifications and Preventing
  Actions</a></li>

  <li><a href="MobCode.html">Code in Phantasmal Mobiles</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Long-Term Phantasmal Building</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A rough <a href="Dependencies.html">dependency graph</a> for
  what components require what other components</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other stuff</h3>

<p><a href="Problems.html">Problems</a>, which lists somewhat
vaguely any problems with the current design any developer may
happen to find. Most of the gripes here are by Shentino,
Phantasmal's new project admin.</p>

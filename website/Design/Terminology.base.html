<h3 style="text-align: center">Terminology in Phantasmal for
Occurrences</h3>

<p>It's a little hard to tell what's going on, word-wise, when you have
all sorts of <a href="Actions.html">actions</a>, <a href=
"EventModel.html">events</a>, <a href="Visibility.html">visibility</a>
and <a href="SpecifyingPerception.html">various sorts of perception</a>
going on. There really are a lot of choices. So let's establish some
definite terms.</p>

<p>A Phantasmal Event is something that occurs within Phantasmal that
may be perceptible to somebody. It may have side-effects (that is,
change things after the immediate event) or not. It may be instant or
take time to occur. It may occur in one sense (say, just sound) or
several. It may be perceptible or not to a given character. All of this
is described in the <a href="EventModel.html">event model</a>
document.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt>

  <dd>An <i>action</i> is taken by a character or mobile. It will often
  generate one or more perceptible <i>events</i>, especially if it is
  performed successfully.</dd>

  <dt>Event</dt>

  <dd>See <i>Phantasmal Event</i>.</dd>

  <dt>Instant</dt>

  <dd>An <i>event</i> is <i>instant</i> if it takes place
  instantaneously rather than having duration and being
  interruptible.</dd>

  <dt>Perceptibility</dt>

  <dd>A numerical rating of how easily detected an event is. The
  <i>Perceptibility</i> of an event is compared to a character's
  <i>Perception</i> to determine if s/he can detect the event.
  Perceptibility may be altered by distance or other factors, depending
  on <a href="SpecifyingPerception.html">the nature of the
  event</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Perception</dt>

  <dd>A numerical rating of how easily a character can detect an event.
  The <i>Perceptibility</i> of an event is compared to a character's
  <i>Perception</i> to determine if s/he can detect the event.</dd>

  <dt>Phantasmal Event</dt>

  <dd>A perceptible event. See the <a href="EventModel.html">event
  model</a> document.</dd>

  <dt>Timed</dt>

  <dd>An <i>event</i> is <i>timed</i> if it has duration. Normally this
  means it will have a distinct beginning and ending, and will be
  interruptible.</dd>

  <dt>Virtual</dt>

  <dd>An <i>event</i> is <i>virtual</i> if is not represented explicitly
  in the game engine. So it is an occurrence, but not one that the game
  represents in this way. See the <a href="EventModel.html">event
  model</a> document for further description.</dd>

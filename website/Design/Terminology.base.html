<h2>Terminology in Phantasmal for Occurrences</h2>

<p>It's a little hard to tell what's going on, word-wise, when you
have all sorts of <a href="Actions.html">actions</a>, <a href=
"EventModel.html">events</a>, <a href=
"Visibility.html">visibility</a> and <a href=
"SpecifyingPerception.html">various sorts of perception</a> going
on. There really are a lot of choices. So let's establish some
definite terms.</p>

<p>A Phantasmal Event is something that occurs within Phantasmal
that may be perceptible to somebody. It may have side-effects (that
is, change things after the immediate event) or not. It may be
instant or take time to occur. It may occur in one sense (say, just
sound) or several. It may be perceptible or not to a given
character. All of this is described in the <a href=
"EventModel.html">event model</a> document.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt>

  <dd>An <i>action</i> is taken by a character or mobile. It will
  often generate one or more perceptible <i>events</i>, especially
  if it is performed successfully.</dd>

  <dt>Event</dt>

  <dd>See <i>Phantasmal Event</i>.</dd>

  <dt>Instant</dt>

  <dd>An <i>event</i> is <i>instant</i> if it takes place
  instantaneously rather than having duration and being
  interruptible.</dd>

  <dt>Perceptibility</dt>

  <dd>A numerical rating of how easily detected an event is. The
  <i>Perceptibility</i> of an event is compared to a character's
  <i>Perception</i> to determine if s/he can detect the event.
  Perceptibility may be altered by distance or other factors,
  depending on <a href="SpecifyingPerception.html">the nature of
  the event</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Perception</dt>

  <dd>A numerical rating of how easily a character can detect an
  event. The <i>Perceptibility</i> of an event is compared to a
  character's <i>Perception</i> to determine if s/he can detect the
  event.</dd>

  <dt>Phantasmal Event</dt>

  <dd>A perceptible event. See the <a href="EventModel.html">event
  model</a> document.</dd>

  <dt>Timed</dt>

  <dd>An <i>event</i> is <i>timed</i> if it has duration. Normally
  this means it will have a distinct beginning and ending, and will
  be interruptible.</dd>

  <dt>Virtual</dt>

  <dd>An <i>event</i> is <i>virtual</i> if is not represented
  explicitly in the game engine. So it is an occurrence, but not
  one that the game represents in this way. See the <a href=
  "EventModel.html">event model</a> document for further
  description.</dd>

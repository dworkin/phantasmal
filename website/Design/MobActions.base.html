<h3 style="text-align: center">Player and Mobile Actions</h3>

<p>In a game where you have players, mobiles and objects separated as
Phantasmal separates them, there is necessarily a heirarchy of action
types. There are 'actions' in the sense of events, as described <a href=
"Actions.html">elsewhere</a>. There are also voluntary player and mobile
actions.</p>

<p>Some commands that a player enters change the MUD's interface to the
player. For instance, setting the preferred output language, or the
number of columns or rows on the player's display, has no analog in the
MUD world. It simply alters the player's interface. These will be called
"pure player commands".</p>

<p>Commands that can conceivably be executed by any mobile are more
common. For instance, movement, gossip or chat, combat, or manipulating
items are all quite well-defined even if done by a non-player character,
though not all of these actions may be possible for all non-player
characters. Phantasmal should have the ability to execute any of these
actions for any mobile, though the result may be an irate message in the
system log.</p>

<p>There should be a command structure to encapsulate a request for such
a mobile action, so that a character may go through a string of such
requests, in order, possibly with scripts running in between. The
command structure can be instantiated by the command parser (if a player
types a text command) or by a script or other interface, which need not
use the same syntax. Having this queue of mobile actions for a given
mobile also makes it reasonable to add delays or other side effects to
prevent players (or mobiles) from being able to execute commands as
quickly as they can type.</p>

<p>Note that pure player commands do <i>not</i> have an entry in the
queue of mobile actions. Pure player commands are executed instantly,
but they should also have no significant effect on the game world. The
player can change from having a display in English to one in Spanish as
many times per second as he likes without it being in any way
exploitable.</p>

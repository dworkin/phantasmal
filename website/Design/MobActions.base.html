<h2>Player and Mobile Actions</h2>

<p>In a game where you have players, mobiles and objects separated
as Phantasmal separates them, there is necessarily a heirarchy of
action types. There are 'actions' in the sense of events, as
described <a href="Actions.html">elsewhere</a>. There are also
voluntary player and mobile actions.</p>

<p>Some commands that a player enters change the MUD's interface to
the player. For instance, setting the preferred output language, or
the number of columns or rows on the player's display, has no
analog in the MUD world. It simply alters the player's interface.
These will be called "pure player commands".</p>

<p>Commands that can conceivably be executed by any mobile are more
common. For instance, movement, gossip or chat, combat, or
manipulating items are all quite well-defined even if done by a
non-player character, though not all of these actions may be
possible for all non-player characters. Phantasmal should have the
ability to execute any of these actions for any mobile, though the
result may be an irate message in the system log.</p>

<p>There should be a command structure to encapsulate a request for
such a mobile action, so that a character may go through a string
of such requests, in order, possibly with scripts running in
between. The command structure can be instantiated by the command
parser (if a player types a text command) or by a script or other
interface, which need not use the same syntax. Having this queue of
mobile actions for a given mobile also makes it reasonable to add
delays or other side effects to prevent players (or mobiles) from
being able to execute commands as quickly as they can type.</p>

<p>Note that pure player commands do <i>not</i> have an entry in
the queue of mobile actions. Pure player commands are executed
instantly, but they should also have no significant effect on the
game world. The player can change from having a display in English
to one in Spanish as many times per second as he likes without it
being in any way exploitable.</p>

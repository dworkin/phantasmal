<h2>Attributes for On-Line Creation</h2>

<p>On-Line Creation (OLC) is used extensively in Phantasmal.
Normally, all features of Phantasmal are first enabled by allowing
them to be used from the command line. The @make_room command and
its derivatives can make this especially easy.</p>

<p>The first generation of @make_room code, while simple, was not
very general. It used a lot of hardcoded checks and repetitive code
to make sure, for each question that it asked, that a reasonable
answer was given.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, for every question it asked, @make_room would
give an initial summary of the question (along with a prompt) and
wait for a response. If the response was considered unacceptable
for some reason, @make_room would explain why and then prompt again
for data. At any time, 'quit' could be typed to exit @make_room
mode and return to the standard command line.</p>

<p>There were some odd concerns. Inheritance, for instance,
required a user to be able to enter special values to indicate that
the value should simply be inherited from the appropriate
parent(s). Being able to edit the object again afterward was
difficult as well, since there was no equivalent @edit_room
command.</p>

<p>State has functions to return:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial greeting text, querying the value, ending with
  prompt</li>

  <li>Function to determine whether the value is acceptable, and
  return an error message telling why it isn't if it isn't. Error
  message should be "quit" if the string entered was "quit", or we
  should otherwise quit @make_room mode if that response is
  given.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: center">MUD Visibility and Perception for
Phantasmal</h3>

<p>Visibility should be important to Phantasmal -- light levels, lines
of sight, ability to notice details. These things are linked.</p>

<p>Most MUDs place limited importance on visibility because allowing
very perceptive characters to notice vast amounts of detail gets very
distracting very quickly. In, say, a forest setting, there are simply
too many things going on. The challenge, then, is not to determine
whether a character can detect particular things, but to reduce the
amount of detail coming in to a manageable level. Phantasmal will
eventually attempt both tasks.</p>

<h3>Detecting Detail</h3>

<p>Detecting detail is a matter of determining what the player can
determine about the environment around him. There are many events
occurring constantly -- mobiles move, objects are gotten and dropped,
mobiles speak or fidget. The question, then, is which ones the player or
character can detect, and how those events appear.</p>

<p>Lines of sight are among the simplest ways to manage this -- in a
given location, there is effectively a list of other locations that are
visible. Since it isn't really possible to tell where a character is
within that location (Phantasmal doesn't use a coordinate grid), we must
simply assume that character can potentially see events in every
location on the list of visible locations. Audible locations are similar
-- a character can hear events occurring in any location on the "audible
list", potentially.</p>

<p>Other senses -- taste, touch and smell -- are all localized. A
character can only taste, touch or smell in his current location, or one
containing it. Smells can propagate, but a character cannot
instantaneously detect a smell in another location.</p>

<p>Locations that are visible or audible from the current location will
still (usually) transmit sights and sounds less well than if the
character were standing in that location. Each will effectively have a
percentage of the visibility/audibility that is actually transmitted.
Note that in the case of visibility, this is not transitive -- you can't
see a location that is visible from another location automatically.
Otherwise you could always see around corners! While it might make sense
to propagate sounds automatically (and at some level, this will need to
occur), Phantasmal will internally simply use an audible-list just like
the visible-list since all of this information can be determined when
the objects are connected by exits.</p>

<p>Objects in Phantasmal can have alternate low-light descriptions.
These are usually part of the markup of the object description, though
they can be detected programmatically if necessary. These are not
specifically low-light descriptions, but are rather low-detail
descriptions. For instance, an object seen through fog, or in darkness,
or far away, or without glasses, would use this description. Thus a
tall, brown-haired man might be "a man" or "somebody tall" at a
distance. Similarly, to recognize another character you must be close
enough and in good enough lighting and visibility to know who you're
looking at.</p>

<p>Conceivably, this could be used to "mis-recognize" people for
mysterious, dramatic or comedic effect. That's longer term, though.</p>

<p>And finally, some objects require appropriate skills, abilities or
characteristics to recognize. For instance, you might need to be an
Angel or Demon to recognize a "tin can of mighty slaying, blessed to the
Lord", or have a good grasp of philately to notice a valuable misprint
stamp on a postcard. Objects in the class heirarchy can mark themselves
as requiring particular skills or attributes to recognize, and players
without those skills or attributes will simply see the object as the
next-most-general in the heirarchy -- the valuable misprint stamp would
be simply a stamp, the blessed tin can would be simply a tin can, or
garbage.</p>

<h3>Managing Detail</h3>

<p>The most difficult part is not creating all of this detail, but
keeping the player from being overwhelmed. Phantasmal eventually hopes
to have several mechanisms for this -- Object Grouping, Event Grouping,
Perceptual Thresholds, and Automatic Detail Adjustment.</p>

<h4>Object Grouping</h4>

<p>Object Grouping is described in <a href="ObjGroup.html">its own
separate document</a>, and relies heavily on the <a href=
"ClassHeirarchy.html">class heirarchy</a>.</p>

<h4>Event Grouping</h4>

<p>Event Grouping is the idea that many events occurring simultaneously
can be grouped into a single message. For instance, twenty balloons
popping at once (perhaps a result of an air pressure change) might say
that "a large cluster of balloons all pop at once" rather than having
twenty separate messages about the balloons popping. The trick is to
detect that these events are occurring roughly simultaneously.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="Actions.html">events of different types could be
grouped</a> in essentially the same way -- the sound of a cannon
roaring, the smell of gunpowder and a small tremor in the earth could be
grouped together into "a cannon fires nearby! It's incredibly loud!",
but a character farther away would only feel the tremor, and a deaf
character in the dark might only smell gunpowder. This combination, if
implemented well, could also allow certain deception to occur. For
instance, a spell that caused a tremor in the earth could be masked by
cannonfire, or a magically-muffled cannon could be used to convince
nearby enemies that such a spell had been cast (but the smell might give
it away!).</p>

<p>Obviously there's a limit to what events can be grouped, but in many
cases (such as the cannon above), the events could be dispatched all at
once, <a href="EventModel.html">specifically marked as being
mergeable</a>. Characters that could detect all of the events would see
them as merged, while characters that couldn't perceive one or more
would see only the relevant parts of the event. As the grouping system
got better it could notice events like separate balloons popping
independently and group them, or group all sounds or smells together if
they occur quickly, and so on.</p>

<p>More difficult is grouping <i>sequential</i> events that are related.
For instance, sharpening a sword might involve taking out a whetstone,
oiling it, using it many times and then putting everything away again.
It isn't necessary to give continual updates on the status of the
activity unless something interrupts it. So the events should be grouped
as a sequence, so that if all goes well the player will see only " you
begin sharpening the sword" and, eventually, "you finish sharpening the
sword". However, if the whetstone oil contains nasty grit which prevents
you from using it, you might see:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; sharpen sword
  You take out a whetstone from your backpack.
  You take out whetstone oil from your backpack.
  You pour the whetstone oil on the whetstone.
  Yuck!  Your whetstone oil is black and gritty, and now your
        whetstone is all dirty and greasy!
  &gt; swear like a golfer
</pre>

<h4>Perceptual Thresholds</h4>

<p>Perceptual Thresholds are a name for preventing a character from
detecting things that are too far apart in intensity. Thus, it's very
difficult to smell something subtle when there's red herring in the air.
It's hard to see the fine detail of a Ming vase when you're blinded by a
flash of magnesium powder burning, and when a cannon goes off, it's hard
to hear yourself think :-)</p>

<p>Mathematically, this means that any character, for a given sense,
will have a dynamic range of detail. For instance, the character will
have a perception for smell, which determines how minute an odor can be
detected or how much can be found out about an odor, but then will also
have a range of smells available, so a high-dynamic-range smeller (like
a bloodhound) might be better at tracking traces of an odor past a very
powerful other odor like pickled fish or rotten eggs. The higher the
dynamic range, the more powerful the interfering odor can be or the more
miniscule the traces of the other odor can be.</p>

<p>Due to Perceptual Thresholds, you might think it would be impossible
to find small things for the sheer rush and bustle of large things. And
that would be correct. Therefore, in implementing commands like
"search", it is important to tune the Perceptual Thresholds
appropriately. Essentially, a search command will broaden a character's
dynamic range temporarily (and quite possibly increase his or her basic
perceptiveness as well) in return for the character staying in one place
and taking no other actions.</p>

<p>Similarly, it might be a good idea to have a "watch" or "concentrate"
command so that the player can pay attention to a particular thing
specifically, no matter what distractions are attempted. This would be
useful to guard an item, to foil a thief's attempts to hide, or to
notice when a particular signal is given.</p>

<h4>Automatic Detail Adjustment</h4>

<p>When a character has a vast amount of information coming in, even if
none of that information is especially intense (as in Perceptual
Thresholds above), the least noteworthy (probably approximated as the
least-perceptible by default) will be lost until a reasonable amount of
information is available. For instance, a character running rapidly
through the woods will probably get shorter room descriptions (cutting
out less perceptible or noteworthy bits) and won't see the ants crawling
along or hear the birdsong -- those things aren't as noteworthy as the
basic room description, and the information is simply coming in too
fast.</p>

<p>If the character is perceiving many tiny events like the movement of
ants and distant birdsong, then a few more obvious nearby events like
the motion and sound of a river will drown out the smaller events
automatically via Perceptual Thresholds (see above). However, if the
forest is relatively quiet or the perceiver has a wide dynamic range,
then all events will be at a fairly similar perceptual level and all
will potentially be perceptible.</p>

<p>When a large number of events are all perceptible at once and Event
Grouping (see above) is unable to reduce the amount of detail to
something manageable, it becomes necessary to give the player a
temporarily-reduced dynamic range of perception, just to reduce the flow
of incoming information. Essentially, less perceptible events are
dropped from the flow of information to the player, but not necessarily
to the character. A character will still usually react to the stimuli in
the normal way. However, most characters' reactions to most stimuli is
to simply observe and ignore.</p>

<p>The subtlety about this reduced perceptual range is that events will
continue to come in at different times, and what events cannot (usually)
be predicted in advance. Therefore, the interface will need to detect
when a player is overloaded and throttle back the character's effective
dynamic range of perception until the number of events is again
manageable. This is conceptually similar to old-style MUD commands like
"verbose" and "terse" for room descriptions. The player is requesting a
level of detail, and the interface adjusts itself to provide
approximately that level of detail.</p>

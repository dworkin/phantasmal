<h2>MUD Visibility and Perception for Phantasmal</h2>

<p>Visibility should be important to Phantasmal -- light levels,
lines of sight, ability to notice details. These things are
linked.</p>

<p>Most MUDs place limited importance on visibility because
allowing very perceptive characters to notice vast amounts of
detail gets very distracting very quickly. In, say, a forest
setting, there are simply too many things going on. The challenge,
then, is not to determine whether a character can detect particular
things, but to reduce the amount of detail coming in to a
manageable level. Phantasmal will eventually attempt both
tasks.</p>

<h3>Detecting Detail</h3>

<p>Detecting detail is a matter of determining what the player can
determine about the environment around him. There are many events
occurring constantly -- mobiles move, objects are gotten and
dropped, mobiles speak or fidget. The question, then, is which ones
the player or character can detect, and how those events
appear.</p>

<p>Lines of sight are among the simplest ways to manage this -- in
a given location, there is effectively a list of other locations
that are visible. Since it isn't really possible to tell where a
character is within that location (Phantasmal doesn't use a
coordinate grid), we must simply assume that character can
potentially see events in every location on the list of visible
locations. Audible locations are similar -- a character can hear
events occurring in any location on the "audible list",
potentially.</p>

<p>Other senses -- taste, touch and smell -- are all localized. A
character can only taste, touch or smell in his current location,
or one containing it. Smells can propagate, but a character cannot
instantaneously detect a smell in another location.</p>

<p>Locations that are visible or audible from the current location
will still (usually) transmit sights and sounds less well than if
the character were standing in that location. Each will effectively
have a percentage of the visibility/audibility that is actually
transmitted. Note that in the case of visibility, this is not
transitive -- you can't see a location that is visible from another
location automatically. Otherwise you could always see around
corners! While it might make sense to propagate sounds
automatically (and at some level, this will need to occur),
Phantasmal will internally simply use an audible-list just like the
visible-list since all of this information can be determined when
the objects are connected by exits.</p>

<p>Objects in Phantasmal can have alternate low-light descriptions.
These are usually part of the markup of the object description,
though they can be detected programmatically if necessary. These
are not specifically low-light descriptions, but are rather
low-detail descriptions. For instance, an object seen through fog,
or in darkness, or far away, or without glasses, would use this
description. Thus a tall, brown-haired man might be "a man" or
"somebody tall" at a distance. Similarly, to recognize another
character you must be close enough and in good enough lighting and
visibility to know who you're looking at.</p>

<p>Conceivably, this could be used to "mis-recognize" people for
mysterious, dramatic or comedic effect. That's longer term,
though.</p>

<p>And finally, some objects require appropriate skills, abilities
or characteristics to recognize. For instance, you might need to be
an Angel or Demon to recognize a "tin can of mighty slaying,
blessed to the Lord", or have a good grasp of philately to notice a
valuable misprint stamp on a postcard. Objects in the class
heirarchy can mark themselves as requiring particular skills or
attributes to recognize, and players without those skills or
attributes will simply see the object as the next-most-general in
the heirarchy -- the valuable misprint stamp would be simply a
stamp, the blessed tin can would be simply a tin can, or
garbage.</p>

<h3>Managing Detail</h3>

<p>The most difficult part is not creating all of this detail, but
keeping the player from being overwhelmed. Phantasmal eventually
hopes to have several mechanisms for this -- Object Grouping, Event
Grouping, Perceptual Thresholds, and Automatic Detail
Adjustment.</p>

<h4>Object Grouping</h4>

<p>Object Grouping is described in <a href="ObjGroup.html">its own
separate document</a>, and relies heavily on the <a href=
"ClassHeirarchy.html">class heirarchy</a>.</p>

<h4>Event Grouping</h4>

<p>Event Grouping is the idea that many events occurring
simultaneously can be grouped into a single message. For instance,
twenty balloons popping at once (perhaps a result of an air
pressure change) might say that "a large cluster of balloons all
pop at once" rather than having twenty separate messages about the
balloons popping. The trick is to detect that these events are
occurring roughly simultaneously.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="Actions.html">events of different types
could be grouped</a> in essentially the same way -- the sound of a
cannon roaring, the smell of gunpowder and a small tremor in the
earth could be grouped together into "a cannon fires nearby! It's
incredibly loud!", but a character farther away would only feel the
tremor, and a deaf character in the dark might only smell
gunpowder. This combination, if implemented well, could also allow
certain deception to occur. For instance, a spell that caused a
tremor in the earth could be masked by cannonfire, or a
magically-muffled cannon could be used to convince nearby enemies
that such a spell had been cast (but the smell might give it
away!).</p>

<p>Obviously there's a limit to what events can be grouped, but in
many cases (such as the cannon above), the events could be
dispatched all at once, <a href="EventModel.html">specifically
marked as being mergeable</a>. Characters that could detect all of
the events would see them as merged, while characters that couldn't
perceive one or more would see only the relevant parts of the
event. As the grouping system got better it could notice events
like separate balloons popping independently and group them, or
group all sounds or smells together if they occur quickly, and so
on.</p>

<p>More difficult is grouping <i>sequential</i> events that are
related. For instance, sharpening a sword might involve taking out
a whetstone, oiling it, using it many times and then putting
everything away again. It isn't necessary to give continual updates
on the status of the activity unless something interrupts it. So
the events should be grouped as a sequence, so that if all goes
well the player will see only " you begin sharpening the sword"
and, eventually, "you finish sharpening the sword". However, if the
whetstone oil contains nasty grit which prevents you from using it,
you might see:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; sharpen sword
  You take out a whetstone from your backpack.
  You take out whetstone oil from your backpack.
  You pour the whetstone oil on the whetstone.
  Yuck!  Your whetstone oil is black and gritty, and now your
        whetstone is all dirty and greasy!
  &gt; swear like a golfer
</pre>

<h4>Perceptual Thresholds</h4>

<p>Perceptual Thresholds are a name for preventing a character from
detecting things that are too far apart in intensity. Thus, it's
very difficult to smell something subtle when there's red herring
in the air. It's hard to see the fine detail of a Ming vase when
you're blinded by a flash of magnesium powder burning, and when a
cannon goes off, it's hard to hear yourself think :-)</p>

<p>Mathematically, this means that any character, for a given
sense, will have a dynamic range of detail. For instance, the
character will have a perception for smell, which determines how
minute an odor can be detected or how much can be found out about
an odor, but then will also have a range of smells available, so a
high-dynamic-range smeller (like a bloodhound) might be better at
tracking traces of an odor past a very powerful other odor like
pickled fish or rotten eggs. The higher the dynamic range, the more
powerful the interfering odor can be or the more miniscule the
traces of the other odor can be.</p>

<p>Due to Perceptual Thresholds, you might think it would be
impossible to find small things for the sheer rush and bustle of
large things. And that would be correct. Therefore, in implementing
commands like "search", it is important to tune the Perceptual
Thresholds appropriately. Essentially, a search command will
broaden a character's dynamic range temporarily (and quite possibly
increase his or her basic perceptiveness as well) in return for the
character staying in one place and taking no other actions.</p>

<p>Similarly, it might be a good idea to have a "watch" or
"concentrate" command so that the player can pay attention to a
particular thing specifically, no matter what distractions are
attempted. This would be useful to guard an item, to foil a thief's
attempts to hide, or to notice when a particular signal is
given.</p>

<h4>Automatic Detail Adjustment</h4>

<p>When a character has a vast amount of information coming in,
even if none of that information is especially intense (as in
Perceptual Thresholds above), the least noteworthy (probably
approximated as the least-perceptible by default) will be lost
until a reasonable amount of information is available. For
instance, a character running rapidly through the woods will
probably get shorter room descriptions (cutting out less
perceptible or noteworthy bits) and won't see the ants crawling
along or hear the birdsong -- those things aren't as noteworthy as
the basic room description, and the information is simply coming in
too fast.</p>

<p>If the character is perceiving many tiny events like the
movement of ants and distant birdsong, then a few more obvious
nearby events like the motion and sound of a river will drown out
the smaller events automatically via Perceptual Thresholds (see
above). However, if the forest is relatively quiet or the perceiver
has a wide dynamic range, then all events will be at a fairly
similar perceptual level and all will potentially be
perceptible.</p>

<p>When a large number of events are all perceptible at once and
Event Grouping (see above) is unable to reduce the amount of detail
to something manageable, it becomes necessary to give the player a
temporarily-reduced dynamic range of perception, just to reduce the
flow of incoming information. Essentially, less perceptible events
are dropped from the flow of information to the player, but not
necessarily to the character. A character will still usually react
to the stimuli in the normal way. However, most characters'
reactions to most stimuli is to simply observe and ignore.</p>

<p>The subtlety about this reduced perceptual range is that events
will continue to come in at different times, and what events cannot
(usually) be predicted in advance. Therefore, the interface will
need to detect when a player is overloaded and throttle back the
character's effective dynamic range of perception until the number
of events is again manageable. This is conceptually similar to
old-style MUD commands like "verbose" and "terse" for room
descriptions. The player is requesting a level of detail, and the
interface adjusts itself to provide approximately that level of
detail.</p>

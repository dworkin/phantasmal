<h2>Class Heirarchy for Phantasmal</h2>

<p>Phantasmal will eventually (I hope) have a multiple-inheritance
class heirarchy of objects, which may inherit properties from each
other. An object will by default allow its parent class to define
most of its properties, but may override specific properties that
are important to the class (such as default volume, weight, etc).
The object will have a Primary parent class, the first on the
inheritance list, from which such properties are inherited. To
inherit a numerical property from a non-Primary parent, it must be
overridden. Some properties, like lists of nouns and adjectives,
are inherited by merging from all parents.</p>

<p>The class heirarchy is an important way to categorize player
perception. Any given object may require particular skills or
properties on the player's part to recognize. For instance, a
Chinese vase might not be recognizable without some knowledge of
China, and would thus default entirely to appearing as a vase to a
player without such lore.</p>

<p>Object Grouping would also work into the Class Heirarchy --
every object type could be marked as a Grouping, perhaps with a
scale factor to tell how preferentially it should be chosen. Thus,
a very specific group like "scimitar" would have a high scale
factor and be chosen readily, while a vaguer description like "farm
equipment" would be chosen less often.</p>

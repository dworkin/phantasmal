<h2>Class Heirarchy for Phantasmal</h2>

<p>Phantasmal will eventually (I hope) have a multiple-inheritance class
heirarchy of objects, which may inherit properties from each other. An
object will by default allow its parent class to define most of its
properties, but may override specific properties that are important to
the class (such as default volume, weight, etc). The object will have a
Primary parent class, the first on the inheritance list, from which such
properties are inherited. To inherit a numerical property from a
non-Primary parent, it must be overridden. Some properties, like lists
of nouns and adjectives, are inherited by merging from all parents.</p>

<p>The class heirarchy is an important way to categorize player
perception. Any given object may require particular skills or properties
on the player's part to recognize. For instance, a Chinese vase might
not be recognizable without some knowledge of China, and would thus
default entirely to appearing as a vase to a player without such
lore.</p>

<p>Object Grouping would also work into the Class Heirarchy -- every
object type could be marked as a Grouping, perhaps with a scale factor
to tell how preferentially it should be chosen. Thus, a very specific
group like "scimitar" would have a high scale factor and be chosen
readily, while a vaguer description like "farm equipment" would be
chosen less often.</p>

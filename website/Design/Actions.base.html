<h2>Actions and Events in MUDs</h2>

<p>Imagine a 'perfect' MUD, one that handles multiple languages,
differing perceptions and event grouping, including everything that
<a href="Visibility.html">the Visibility</a> document mentions, and does
it all seamlessly and flawlessly. Let's describe what it actually does
and start assigning some names to components.</p>

<p>There are <em>instant</em> events going on all the time.
<em>Instant</em> events are anything that can echo text to a player. For
example, if somebody says something in a room, that's a simple
<em>instant</em> event. If a cannon fires, or a man in a suit enters the
room, those are also <em>instant</em> events. The text that is displayed
may be different for different players. In some cases no text may happen
at all. If no players' characters are in the room, or the event is too
subtle for them to perceive, or if the event gets grouped with other
events and echoed later, then no text will be displayed for the event.
Different text will be sent to different players if the players speak
different languages, and perhaps if the characters have different levels
of some specific perception skill.</p>

<p>Some events will have multiple components -- an obvious component and
a hidden one, for instance, or components for multiple different senses
such as hearing and sight. The player will receive different text in
different circumstances for these events, and our perfect MUD will group
the various components into a potentially smaller number of pieces of
text. The cannon firing, despite the hearing and smell components, can
still all be grouped together as "the cannon fires". Sets of events that
are grouped together, and all go off together from the same trigger, are
called Composite Events. They are the easiest kind of events to combine
into less text since they are already lumped together.</p>

<p>Every event will consist of some pieces of player-perceivable markup
(PPM). A piece of PPM can appear differently to a character depending on
skills known, light level, and other factors described <a href=
"Visibility.html">here</a>. Traditionally, <em>instant</em> events in
MUDs consist of one chunk of PPM each for "to actor", "to victim",
possibly "to self" for reflexive verbs, and "to others". Specific
multi-targeted events might have more, and untargeted events will have
fewer.</p>

<p>Every PPM will effectively consist of a set of Phrases. A Phrase (in
Phantasmal) is a string which can appear differently to different
players, but not usually to different characters. A Phrase can often
translate itself into different languages, so it will appear differently
to a player who has requested an English interface than one who asks to
view the MUD in Spanish. It may also contain simple markup like bold,
italics, or color codes, which are individually translated by different
players' terminals.</p>

<p>Phantasmal doesn't yet support a separate PPM object, though it
probably should. And it should name it something snappier :-)</p>

<p>Each <em>instant</em> action will also carry information about what
sense it occurs in (sight, sound, taste, touch, vibration, infrared,
ESP, etc). This may be combined with information about what skills are
required to perceive the event.</p>

<p><em>Timed</em> events are, in effect, scripted arrangements of
<em>instant</em> actions. A <em>timed</em> event is an action that
conceptually occurs over a significant period of time without changing.
A buzzing sound, the sharpening of a blade, the smell of banana leaves
and an army shuffling down a muddy slope could all be represented as
<em>timed</em> events. The common factor is that each of these takes a
nonzero period of time within the MUD.</p>

<p><em>Timed</em> events consist of an <em>instant</em> event to begin,
another for people coming into range (walking into a room with the
sound, for instance, or coming into view of the muddy slope), another
for when the event stops, another for when you exit its field of
influence and a final event for when it is interrupted. Thus, for the
buzzing sound:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; north
  You enter the aviary.
  You hear a buzzing sound here.
  &gt; put in earplugs
  You put in earplugs.
  The buzzing sound is no longer audible.
  &gt; remove earplugs
  You remove your earplugs.
  You hear a buzzing sound here.
  &gt; south
  You head south.
  The buzzing sound is no longer audible.
  You enter the Boring Room.  You should leave north.
  &gt; north
  You enter the aviary.
  You hear a buzzing sound here.
  &gt; listen
  There's a buzzing sound here.  It might be coming from some bushes.
  &gt; stomp on bee
  You stomp on the bee hidden in the bushes.
  The buzzing sound stops abruptly.
</pre>

<p>The Continuing Action may have different 'ending' events depending on
how it finishes. For instance, the action of drawing a sword might be an
event designed to allow for interruption:</p>
<pre>
  &gt; draw sword
  You draw your sword with a flourish.
  &gt; sheathe sword
  You do.
  Odin enters.
  &gt; draw sword
  You reach for your sword.
  Quick as a flame, Odin wields his spear.
  You draw your sword with a flourish.
</pre>

<p>Note that the sword-drawing event has no starting sub-event (or else
that event is silent). The event says that you draw your sword if the
action completes successfully, but says that you reach for your sword if
it's interrupted.</p>

<p>An example of a complex action with several senses:</p>
<pre>
  An explosion rocks the hall, the first of many.  It shakes you
  down to your toes.
  &gt; close eyes
  You hear an enormous "boom!" and smell smoke and brimstone.  You are
  shaken down to your toes.
  &gt; hold nose
  You hear an enormous "boom!".  You are shaken down to your toes.
  &gt; curl up in a ball on the floor
  You hear yet another enormous "boom!".  You smell smoke and brimstone.
  &gt; am I holding my nose?
  No, your arms are around your knees.
</pre>

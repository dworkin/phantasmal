    <h3 align="center"> Object Grouping for Phantasmal, Speculations </h3>

    <p>
      We'd like to have objects group up when they're all in the same
      area.  For instance, if you drop seventeen mixed swords in a pile
      in the middle of the floor, we'd like to see a "pile of swords"
      rather than each one having its own entry.  As we add opportunity
      for object customization (wear and tear, difference in manufacture,
      varying styles), this will get even more important.
    </p>

    <p>
      A first, simple cut at the problem would simply use a single
      inheritance heirarchy, and each node could be marked with whether
      it could be used as a player-visible grouping -- "sword" would be
      a good one, but "iron object" would need to be marked as not
      player-visible, or perhaps simply given a fudge factor such that it
      wouldn't often be used.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we'd like to have multiple inheritance, not just single
      inheritance.  A group of a shovel, ten hoes, a wheelbarrow, a
      thresher, and a pickaxe might be characterized by either
      &quot;some farm equipment, a wheelbarrow and a pickaxe&quot; or
      &quot;some tools, a wheelbarrow and a thresher&quot;.  Conceivably
      it could also be &quot;some metal objects&quot;, but that's not
      very descriptive, so again, the &quot;metal objects&quot; group
      would be non-player-visible, or tagged such that it was very
      rarely chosen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem with multiple inheritance is choosing how to
      characterize a group of objects, and doing so quite quickly.
      Bear in mind that two different characters (with different fields
      of view from their two locations) might see these objects
      differently.  For instance, one might not see the thresher from
      his point of view in the hayloft, while the other might not see
      the pickaxe from outside the door.  This group of objects (sometimes
      including the pickaxe and thresher) will
      have to <i>simultaneously</i> be &quot;some farm equipment and
      a wheelbarrow&quot; and &quot;some tools and a wheelbarrow&quot;.
      That suggests that we need some kind of caching scheme in which
      we can quickly run over the structures for multiple groups of
      objects and determine a description.
    </p>

    <p>
      One example scheme:  for every group of four or more objects in
      a single location, make a group accounting object.  This doesn't 
      have to be an object in the MUD sense, but the location containing
      the objects must be able to easily find and use it.  This group
      accounting object (GAO) will lazily categorize the objects into the
      group heirarchy when requested to.  It must be very quick to
      merge two or more of these GAOs into a new combined GAO -- for
      instance, the GAOs for the hayloft, the main floor of the barn
      and the area just outside the barn door will frequently be merged
      because they will frequently be visible from the same locations.

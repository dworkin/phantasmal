<h1>How to make good quests</h1>

<p><i>Ellery: The text below was adapted by me for TubMud. Don't
feel irritated by the occasional references to it and my having a
different character name there. Also, don't worry about the
patronizing mood I employ in the notes every now and then - this
text is meant to enforce a mud policy on TubMud, it's only a source
of ideas here on Nanny.</i></p>

<p><i>Macbeth: This is taken from the manual of a compiler for
INFOCOM-like games. And while muds are different from text
adventures, they have still enough in common to use similar design
criteria for them. Besides, it is a very good text.</i></p>
<hr>

<h2>1. A Bill of Player's Rights</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most important point about designing a game is to
think as a player and not a designer. I think the least a player
deserves is:</p>

<h3>1. Not to be killed without warning</h3>

<p>At its most basic level, this means that a room with three
exits, two of which lead to instant death and the third to
treasure, is unreasonable without some hint. Mention of which
brings us to:</p>

<h3>2. Not to be given horribly unclear hints</h3>

<p>Many years ago, I played a game in which going north from a cave
led to a lethal pit. The hint was: there was a pride of lions
carved above the doorway. Good hints can be skilfully hidden, or
very brief (I think, for example, the hint in the moving-rocks
plain problem in "Spellbreaker" is a masterpiece) but should not
need explaining even after the event. A more sophisticated version
of (1) leads us to:</p>

<h3>3. To be able to win without experience of past lives</h3>

<p>Suppose, for instance, there is a nuclear bomb buried under some
anonymous floor somewhere, which must be disarmed. It is
unreasonable to expect a player to dig up this floor purely because
in previous games, the bomb blew up there. To take a more concrete
example, in "The Lurking Horror" there is something which needs
cooking for the right length of time. As far as I can tell, the
only way to find out the right time is by trial and error. But you
only get one trial per game. In principle a good player should be
able to play the entire game out without doing anything illogical.
In similar vein:</p>

<h3>4. To be able to win without knowledge of future events</h3>

<p>For example, the game opens near a shop. You have one coin and
can buy a lamp, a magic carpet or a periscope. Five minutes later
you are transported away without warning to a submarine, whereupon
you need a periscope. If you bought the carpet, bad luck.</p>

<h3>5. Not to have the game closed off without warning</h3>

<p>Closed off meaning that it would become impossible to proceed at
some later date. If there is a papier-mache wall which you can walk
through at the very beginning of the game, it is extremely annoying
to find that a puzzle at the very end requires it to still be
intact, because every one of your saved games will be useless.
Similarly it is quite common to have a room which can only be
visited once per game. If there are two different things to be
accomplished there, this should be hinted at.</p>

<h3>6. Not to need to do unlikely things</h3>

<p>For example, a game which depends on asking a policeman about
something he could not reasonably know about. (Less extremely, the
problem of the hacker's keys in "The Lurking Horror".) Another
unlikely thing is waiting in uninteresting places. If you have a
junction such that after five turns an elf turns up and gives you a
magic ring, a player may well never spend five turns there and
never solve what you intended to be straightforward. On the other
hand, if you were to put something which demanded investigation in
the junction, it might be fair enough. ("Zork III" is especially
poor in this respect.)</p>

<h3>7. Not to need to do boring things for the sake of it</h3>

<p>In the bad old days many games would make life difficult by
putting objects needed to solve a problem miles away from where the
problem was, despite all logic - say, putting a boat in the middle
of a desert. Or, for example, it might be fun to have a four-discs
tower of Hanoi puzzle in a game. But not an eight-discs one.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: This applies to mazes as well. However, they are
somewhat different. See the section on mazes below for more
information.</i></p>

<h3>8. Not to have to type exactly the right verb</h3>

<p>For instance, looking inside a box finds nothing, but searching
it does. Or consider the following dialogue (amazingly, from
"Sorcerer"):</p>
<pre>
    &gt;unlock journal
    (with the small key)
    No spell would help with that!

    &gt;open journal
    (with the small key)
    The journal springs open.
</pre>

<p>This is so misleading as to constitute a bug. But it's an easy
design fault to fall into. (Similarly, the wording needed to use
the brick in Zork II strikes me as quite unfair. Or perhaps I
missed something obvious.)</p>

<h3>9. To be allowed reasonable synonyms</h3>

<p>In the same room in "Sorcerer" is a "woven wall hanging" which
can instead be called "tapestry" (though not "curtain"). This is
not a luxury, it's an essential.</p>

<h3>10. To have a decent parser</h3>

<p>This goes without saying. At the very least it should provide
for taking and dropping multiple objects.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Unfortunately, the parser is the weakest spot of
every LPmud so far. There isn't much you can do about it. I'm
currently thinking about a way of making better parsing
easier.</i></p>

<p><strong>The last few are more a matter of taste, but I believe
in them:</strong></p>

<h3>11. To have reasonable freedom of action</h3>

<p>Being locked up in a long sequence of prisons, with only brief
escapes between them, is not all that entertaining. After a while
the player begins to feel that the designer has tied him to a chair
in order to shout the plot at him.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Likewise for MUDs. Too often quest designers choose
the easy way out by making a room teleport-proof and blocking all
exits until the victim has been told the entire story.</i></p>

<h3>12. Not to depend much on luck</h3>

<p>Small chance variations add to the fun, but only small ones. The
thief in "Zork I" seems to me to be just about right in this
respect, and similarly the spinning room in "Zork II". But a
ten-ton weight which fell down and killed you at a certain point in
half of all games is just annoying.</p>

<h3>13. To be able to understand a problem once it is solved</h3>

<p>This may sound odd, but many problems are solved by accident or
trial and error. A guard-post which can be passed only if you are
carrying a spear, for instance, ought to have some indication that
this is why you're allowed past. (The most extreme example must be
the notorious Bank of Zork.)</p>

<h3>14. Not to be given too many red herrings</h3>

<p>A few red herrings make a game more interesting. A very nice
feature of "Zork I", "II" and "III" is that they each contain red
herrings explained in the others (in one case, explained in
"Sorcerer"). But difficult puzzles tend to be solved last, and the
main technique players use is to look at their maps and see what's
left that they don't understand. This is frustrated when there are
many insoluble puzzles and useless objects. So you can expect
players to lose interest if you aren't careful. My personal view is
that red herrings ought to have some clue provided (even only much
later): for instance, if there is a useless coconut near the
beginning, then perhaps much later an absent-minded botanist could
be found who wandered about dropping them. The coconut should at
least have some rationale.</p>

<p>The very worst game I've played for red herrings is "Sorcerer",
which by my reckoning has 10.</p>

<h3>15. To have a good reason why something is impossible</h3>

<p>Unless it's also funny, a very contrived reason why something is
impossible just irritates. (The reason one can't walk on the grass
in "Trinity" is only just funny enough, I think.)</p>

<h3>16. Not to need to be American to understand hints</h3>

<p>The diamond maze in "Zork II" being a case in point. Similarly,
it's polite to allow the player to type English or American
spellings or idiom. For instance "Trinity" endears itself to
English players in that the soccer ball can be called "football" -
soccer is a word almost never used in England.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: I cannot stress this point enough. Currently, nine
out of ten players who play TubMud are native German speakers and
not used to the intricacies of the English language.</i></p>

<h3>17. To know how the game is getting on</h3>

<p>In other words, when the end is approaching, or how the plot is
developing. Once upon a time, score was the only measure of this,
but hopefully not any more.</p>
<hr>

<h2>2. What makes a good game?</h2>

<h3>1. The Plot</h3>

<p>The days of games which consisted of wandering around doing
unrelated things to get treasures, are long passed: the original
Adventure was fun, and so was Zork, but two such games are enough.
There should be some overall task to be achieved, and it ought to
be apparent to the player in advance.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that it should be apparent at once. Instead,
one can begin with just an atmosphere or mood. But if so, there
must be a consistent style throughout and this isn't easy to keep
up. "The Lurking Horror" is an excellent example of a successful
genre style; so is "Leather Goddesses of Phobos".</p>

<p>At its most basic, this means there should be no electric drills
lying about in a medieval-style fantasy. The original Adventure was
very clean in this respect, whereas Zork was less so: I think this
is why Adventure remains the better game even though virtually
everything in Zork was individually better.</p>

<p>If the chosen genre isn't fresh and relatively new, then the
game had better be very good.</p>

<p>Plot begins with the opening message, rather the way an episode
of Star Trek begins before the credits come up. It ought to be
striking and concise (not an effort to sit through, like the title
page of "Beyond Zork"). By and large Infocom were good at this. A
fine example is the overture to "Trinity" (by Brian Moriarty):</p>

<p>Sharp words between the superpowers. Tanks in East Berlin. And
now, reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite blackout. It's enough
to spoil your continental breakfast.</p>

<p>But the world will have to wait. This is the last day of your
$599 London Getaway Package, and you're determined to soak up as
much of that authentic English ambience as you can. So you've left
the tour bus behind, ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park
for a contemplative stroll through the Kensington Gardens.</p>

<p>Already you know: who you are (an unadventurous American
tourist, of no significance in the world); exactly where you are
(Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, London, England); and what is going
on (World War III is about to break out). Notice the careful
details: mention of the BBC, of continental breakfasts, of the
camera and the tour bus. More subtly, "Trinity" is a game which
starts as a kind of escapism from a disastrous world out of
control: notice the way the first paragraph is in tense, blunt,
headline-like sentences, whereas the second is much more relaxed.
So a lot has been achieved by these two opening paragraphs.</p>

<p>The most common plots boil down to saving the world, by
exploring until eventually you vanquish something ("Lurking Horror"
again, for instance) or collecting some number of objects hidden in
awkward places ("Leather Goddesses" again, say). The latter can get
very hackneyed (got to find the nine magic spoons of Zenda to
reunite the Kingdom...), so much so that it becomes a bit of a joke
("Hollywood Hijinx") but still it isn't a bad idea, because it
enables many different problems to be open at once.</p>

<p>Most games have a prologue, a middle game and an end game, which
are usually quite closed off from each other. Usually once one of
these phases has been left, it cannot be returned to.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Well, you haven't much of a choice where the genre
is concerned, TubMud having wizrule #8 and a generic fantasy
setting. All the more reason to invest some amount of thinking in
the plot.</i></p>

<h3>2. The Prologue</h3>

<p>In establishing an atmosphere, the prologue gives a good head
start. In the original mainframe Adventure, this was the
above-ground landscape; the fact that it was there gave a much
greater sense of claustrophobia and depth to the underground bulk
of the game.</p>

<p>Sometimes a dream-sequence is used (for instance, in "Lurking
Horror"), or sometimes simply a more mundane region of game (for
instance, the guild-house in "Sorcerer"). It should not be too
large or too hard.</p>

<p>As well as establishing the mood of the game, and giving out
some background information, the prologue has to attract a player
enough to make him carry on playing. It's worth imagining that the
player is only toying with the game at this stage, and isn't
drawing a map or being at all careful. If the prologue is big, the
player will quickly get lost and give up. If it is too hard, then
many players simply won't reach the middle game.</p>

<p>Perhaps eight to ten rooms is the largest a prologue ought to
be, and even then it should have a simple (easily remembered) map
layout.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: In TubMud, there should also be a more or less
obvious point where to start. In addition, you may try to write a
quest with several possible starting points. Or one, where two
players have to start at different locations.</i></p>

<h3>3. The Middle Game</h3>

<p>A useful exercise is to draw out a tree (or more accurately a
lattice) of all the puzzles in a game. At the top is a node
representing the start of the game, and then lower nodes represent
solved puzzles. An arrow is drawn between two puzzles if one has to
be solved before the other can be. For instance, a simple portion
might look like:</p>
<pre>
                       Start
                      /     \
                     /       \
              Find key     Find car
                     \        |
                      \       |
                       Start car
                           |
                           |
                     Reach motorway
</pre>

<p>This is useful because it checks that the game is soluble (for
example, if the ignition key had been kept in a phone box on the
motorway, it wouldn't have been) but also because it shows the
overall structure of the game. The questions to ask are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much is visible at once?</li>

  <li>Do large parts of the game depend on one difficult
  puzzle?</li>

  <li>How many steps does a typical problem need?</li>
</ul>

<p>Some games, such as the original Adventure, are very wide: there
are thirty or so puzzles, all easily available, none leading to
each other. Others, such as "Spellbreaker", are very narrow: a long
sequence of puzzles, each of which leads only to a chance to solve
the next.</p>

<p>A compromise is probably best. Wide games are not very
interesting, while narrow ones can in a way be easy: if only one
puzzle is available at a time, the player will just concentrate on
it, and will not be held up by trying to use objects which are
provided for different puzzles.</p>

<p>Bottlenecks should be avoided unless they are reasonably
guessable: otherwise many players will simply get no further.</p>

<p>Puzzles ought not to be simply a matter of typing in one
well-chosen line. One hallmark of a good game is not to get any
points for picking up an easily-available key and unlocking a door
with it. This sort of low-level achievement - like wearing an
overcoat found lying around, for instance - should not be enough. A
memorable puzzle will need several different ideas to solve (the
Babel fish dispenser in "Hitch-hikers", for instance).</p>

<h3>4. Density</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, the sole measure of quality in advertisements
for adventure games was the number of rooms. Even quite small
programs would have 200 rooms, which meant only minimal room
descriptions and simple puzzles which were scattered thinly over
the map.</p>

<p>Nowadays a healthier principle has been adopted: that (barring a
few junctions and corridors) there should be something out of the
ordinary about every room.</p>

<p>One reason for the quality of the "Infocom" games is that the
version 3 system has an absolute maximum of 255 objects, which
needs to cover rooms, objects and many other things (eg, compass
directions, or the spells in "Enchanter" et al). Many "objects" are
not portable anyway: walls, tapestries, thrones, control panels,
coal-grinding machines and so on.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, four objects to one room is about right:
this means there will be, say, 50-60 rooms. Of the remaining 200
objects, one can expect 15-20 to be used up by the game's
administration (eg, a "darkness" room, 10 compass directions, a
player and so on). Another 50-75 or so objects will be portable but
the largest number, at least 100, will be furniture.</p>

<p>So an object limit can be a blessing as well as a curse: it
forces the designer to make the game dense. Rooms are too precious
to be wasted.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Did I ever mention that I hated those (n+1)-rooms
quests with nothing in them? Quantos's maze, albeit not an official
quest, is probably the worst example. Moreover, you shouldn't make
your quest too long. It probably will get too boring after some
time.</i></p>

<h3>5. Rewards</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of reward which need to be given to a player
in return for solving a puzzle. One is obvious: that the game
should advance a little. But the player at the keyboard needs a
reward as well, that the game should offer something new to look
at. In the old days, when a puzzle was solved, the player simply
got a bar of gold and had one less puzzle to solve.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: This is a bit more tricky in TubMud, with all our
problems with quests handing out tons of gold and special items.
You should think twice before handing out any material rewards.
Some experience points would of course be a better idea. But be
careful not to unbalance the game.</i></p>

<p>Much better is to offer the player some new rooms and objects to
play with, as this is a real incentive. If no new rooms are on
offer, at least the "treasure" objects can be made interesting,
like the spells in the "Enchanter" trilogy or the cubes in
"Spellbreaker".</p>

<h3>6. Mazes</h3>

<p>Almost every game contains a maze. Nothing nowadays will ever
equal the immortal <em>You are in a maze of twisty little passages,
all alike.</em></p>

<p>But now we are all jaded. A maze should offer some twist which
hasn't been done before (the ones in "Enchanter" and "Sorcerer"
being fine examples).</p>

<p>The point is not to make it hard and boring. The standard maze
solution is to litter the rooms with objects in order to make the
rooms distinguishable. It's easy enough to obstruct this, the thief
in "Zork I" being about the wittiest way of doing so. But that only
makes a maze tediously difficult.</p>

<p>Instead there should be an elegant quick solution: for instance
a guide who needs to be bribed, or fluorescent arrows painted on
the floor which can only be seen in darkness (plus a hint about
darkness, of course).</p>

<p>Above all, don't design a maze which appears to be a standard
impossibly hard one: even if it isn't, a player may lose heart and
give up rather than go to the trouble of mapping it.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: YES. Maybe that's a personal quirk of mine, but I
resent mapping mazes as part of a quest. This usually (though not
always) means that the author was lacking the imagination to come
up with something more original. But of course it is perfectly
acceptable to send somebody on a wild-goose chase through a maze if
he was too stupid to figure out an easier way.</i></p>

<h3>7. Wrong guesses</h3>

<p>For some puzzles, a perfectly good alternative solution will
occur to players. It's good style to code two or more solutions to
the same puzzle, if that doesn't upset the rest of the game. But
even if it does, at least a game should say something when a good
guess is made. (Trying to cross the volcano on the magic carpet in
"Spellbreaker" is a case in point.)</p>

<p>One reason why "Zork" held the player's attention so firmly (and
why it took about ten times the code size, despite being slightly
smaller than the original mainframe Adventure) was that it had a
huge stock of usually funny responses to reasonable things which
might be tried.</p>

<p>My favourite funny response, which I can't resist reprinting
here, is:</p>
<pre>
   You are falling towards the ground, wind whipping around you.
   &gt;east
   Down seems more likely.     <i>"Spellbreaker"</i>
</pre>

<p>(Though I also recommend trying to take the sea serpent in "Zork
II".) This is a good example because it's exactly the sort of
boring rule (can't move from the midair position) which most
designers usually want to code as fast as possible, and don't write
with any imagination.</p>

<p>Just as some puzzles should have more than one solution, some
objects should have more than one purpose. In bad old games,
players automatically threw away everything as soon as they'd used
them. In better designed games, obviously useful things (like the
crowbar and the gloves in "Lurking Horror") should be hung on to by
the player throughout.</p>

<h3>8. The Map</h3>

<p>To maintain an atmosphere throughout it's vital that the map
should be continuous. Adventure games used to have maps like</p>
<pre>
            Glacier
               |
          Oriental Room  --  Fire Station
           (megaphone)        (pot plant)
               |
           Cheese Room
</pre>

<p>in which the rooms bore no relation to each other, so that the
game had no overall geography at all, and objects were unrelated to
the rooms they were in. Much more believable is something like</p>
<pre>
       Snowy Mountainside
                \  
             Carved Tunnel
                   |
             Oriental Room  -- Jade Passage -- Fire Dragon
                (buddha)       (bonsai tree)      Room
                   |
             Blossom Room
</pre>

<p>Try to have some large-scale geography too: the mountainside
should extend across the map in both directions. If there is a
stream passing through a given location, what happens to it? And so
on.</p>

<p>In designing a map, it adds to the interest to make a few
connections in the rarer compass directions (NE, NW, SE, SW) to
prevent the player from a feeling that the game has a square grid.
Also, it's nice to have a few (possibly long) loops which can be
walked around, to prevent endless retracing of steps.</p>

<p>If the map is very large, or if a good deal of to-and-froing is
called for, there should be some rapid means of moving across it,
such as the magic words in Adventure, or the cubes in
"Spellbreaker".</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: This is VERY important in a MUD. Try to maintain
consistency.</i></p>

<h3>9. The End Game</h3>

<p>Some end games are small ("Lurking Horror", or "Sorcerer" for
instance), others large (the master game of the mainframe
Adventure). Nonetheless almost all games have one.</p>

<p>End games serve two purposes. Firstly they give the player a
sense of being near to success, and can be used to culminate the
plot, to reveal the game's secrets. This is obvious enough. But
secondly they also serve to stop the final stage of the game from
being too hard.</p>

<p>As a designer, you don't usually want the last step to be too
difficult; you want to give the player the satisfaction of
finishing, as a reward for having got through the game. (But of
course you want to make him work for it.) An end game helps,
because it narrows the game, so that only a few rooms and objects
are accessible.</p>

<p>The most annoying thing is requiring the player to have brought
a few otherwise useless objects with him. The player should not be
thinking that the reason for being stuck on the master game is that
something very obscure should have been done 500 turns before.</p>

<h3>10. And Finally...</h3>

<p>Finally, the winner gets some last message (which, like the
opening message, should have something amusing in it and should not
be too long). That needn't quite be all, though. In its final
incarnations (alas, not the one included in Lost Treasures), "Zork
I" offered winners access to the hints system at the RESTART,
RESTORE or QUIT prompt.</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Of course, this is quite different in TubMud. You'll
have to arrange for a quest reward and guide the player back to a
place which has a connection to the rest of the MUD. There may even
be more than just a message - use your imagination. In general, a
good quest doesn't even need to deal out a huge amount of rewards -
playing it will have been enough of a reward.</i></p>

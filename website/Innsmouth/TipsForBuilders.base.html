<h3 style="text-align: center">General Tips for MUD Builders</h3>

<p>Most of these are inspired by TopMUDSites.com, from a thread on their
Builder board. Massive props especially to Sanvean of Armageddon MUD and
Estarra.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan your area first, and pay attention to how it would 'really'
  work. If your area is a fortress, an inn, a kitchen or a stretch of
  wolf-ridden woods, think about what such an area should have in it,
  and how it should be laid out.</li>

  <li>Make your NPCs vibrant. There should be at least two or three
  different actions and reactions available (such as emotes, things they
  say, or stimuli they react to) that are specific to that NPC.</li>

  <li>Details, details, details</li>

  <li>Use all five senses, and (sparingly) impressions like
  'foreboding'. On impressions, Estarra says: <i>For example, you walk
  into a sacrificial pit for a dark god and read as part of the
  description "Despair and fear vibrate in the air."</i> [...] <i>Or
  even: "The statue of the ancient god makes even the most hardened
  heart flutter at the majesty." (Note: I don't mean things like "You
  walk into the room and feel fear." I never use the first
  person.)</i></li>

  <li>Use active, dynamic verbs rather than passive verbs</li>

  <li>Use the present tense, unless you have a very good reason not
  to.</li>

  <li>Use good grammar and spelling. Make sure to use complete
  sentences, not fragments or run-ons.</li>

  <li>Don't put two spaces between sentences. It looks fine in office
  correspondence but it adapts poorly to MUDs.</li>

  <li>Don't let your editor help you. Microsoft Word and some other
  editors will automatically format for you, add bullets and
  superscripts and whatnot. Turn this feature off.</li>

  <li>From Estarra, verbatim:

    <p>Don't use "seems to" or "looks like" or "appears to be". This is
    a common mistake that strikes even the very best and experienced
    builder. Feel free to use metaphors and simile, but using the
    phrases "seems", "looks like", and "appears to be" weakens the
    impact. If the man appears to be the oldest man in the village, then
    chances are the man <i>is</i> the oldest man in the village.
    Ninety-nine percent of the time, it can be avoided. For example,</p>

    <p><b>Weak</b></p>

    <p>This troll appears to be the largest of its kind. Its skin seems
    to be an almost phosphorescent green and its large fangs look like
    it could tear through not only skin but bone.</p>

    <p><b>Dynamic</b></p>

    <p>The troll is enormous, the largest of its kind. Its skin glows an
    almost phosphorescent green and its large fangs could tear through
    not only skin but bone.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Don't reference the player in the room. Don't tell him what s/he
  thinks, what s/he feels, or where s/he just came from. Don't tell the
  player their opinion. Avoid the words "you", "your" and so on.
  Describe the room and the impact will be greater, especially if the
  player doesn't feel the way you claim.</li>

  <li>Don't describe important objects or mobiles in the room. What if
  they aren't there any more? Create this objects or mobiles and let
  them describe themselves.</li>

  <li>Where possible, avoid referencing history in the room
  descriptions. Unless you know the player is aware of a particular
  conflict, political group or similar (and leaving readable scrolls
  describing it does <i>not</i> mean the player knows, or remembers, or
  associates the scroll with the current room!), don't mention that
  group or event.</li>

  <li>Ask your coders for things. If you have a vision of how something
  could be done with a small new feature, suggest it. The worst that
  will happen is that they'll say 'no'. If they have countersuggestions
  for different ways to do the same thing, listen.</li>

  <li>Use multiple aliases. Make sure that the old witch can be a witch,
  a woman, an old witch, an old woman, an evil witch, and so on. Your
  codebase may be able to help you with this for gender, class, race and
  so on.</li>

  <li>Personalization and uniqueness -- items 'skinned' from mobiles,
  equipment that changes condition, etc add a lot.</li>

  <li>Sanvean suggests weather changes, travel, and equipment that
  changes status because of it -- gets wet, bloody, rusty, sweaty,
  dusty, etc.</li>

  <li>Have your zones/sectors affect the feel of things. Change travel
  messages, messages from spells, etc. If possible, be able to forage
  for various things in different sectors (water, food, rocks, sticks,
  salt, etc).</li>

  <li>Tattoos and scars that can be acquired in play, and that can be
  set on NPCs as well.</li>

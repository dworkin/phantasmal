    <h2 align="center"> Innsmouth MUD </h2>

    <font size="4">

    <p> Innsmouth is a decaying Massachusetts town that hides a
      terrible secret.  Like a snowball becoming an avalanche, like
      a lie that hides itself in larger lies, so has the Shadow Over
      Innsmouth has bred new terrors.  The Shadow waits for you to
      explore this tiny, decrepit and terrified New England town.
    </p>

    <p> Innsmouth MUD is inspired by the story &quot;The Shadow Over
      Innsmouth&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft, and other
      short stories.  It was built as a test MUD for the
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">Phantasmal</a>
      MUD Library. </p>

    <p> In its current condition, it isn't meant to be a full-on
      Lovecraft experience in MUD form.  Rather, it's a set of
      interesting vignettes meant to showcase Phantasmal's
      abilities.  I hope to produce something worthy of the
      gentleman from Providence eventually, but that's a long-term
      goal. </p>

    <p> You can find some of
      <a href="http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/index.html">
	Lovecraft's work</a> on the web.  My understanding is that
      his stuff is no longer under copyright due to failure to renew on
      the part of Arkham Press (and on his own behalf).  The Gizmology.net
      Lovecraft Archive seems to be down, or I'd link to
      <a href="http://www.ech-pi-el.com/lovecraft/works/index.htm">
      that one</a>, and the note on
      <a href="http://www.ech-pi-el.com/lovecraft/copyrights.htm">
	copyrights</a> to the stories.  You could check the Wayback
      Machine for them, I guess.

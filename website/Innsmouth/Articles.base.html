<h3 style="text-align: center">Articles for Phantasmal and
Innsmouth Developers</h3>

<p>I've repeatedly recommended the various Skotos articles. Not
only do I have definite personal favorites, there are also
definitely articles that are more relevant to Innsmouth or just
generally more informative and specific than others. But I haven't
been very good about telling anybody which ones. This page is meant
for articles, Skotos and otherwise, that I consider strongly
relevant to Phantasmal's or Innsmouth's development in one way or
another. Or, y'know, I just think they're cool. Whichever.</p>

<p>Don't take a column's lack of presence on this page as an
indictment -- I haven't listed everything I care about, everything
I liked or even the best stuff that's relevant to Innsmouth. But
this gets <i>something</i> up that I can recommend to people.</p>

<h3>From "Trials, Triumphs and Trivialities" by Shannon
Appelcline</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_Oct05.html">Objectionable
  Economies</a>, a description of object economies and what you
  need to do to make them work. Not yet relevant to Innsmouth, but
  eventually...</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_19.html">Hobgoblins, Part
  One</a> which describes global versus local verbs. Particularly
  relevent to parser debates on the Phantasmal bboards.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_20.html">Hobgoblins, Part
  Two</a> on things like inheritance (multiple kinds) and
  consistency. Good stuff.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_28.html">The
  Dynamic Dilemma, Part Two</a> discusses spawning. Note how
  Phantasmal doesn't do simple spawn points yet? Read this. Do
  it.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_33.html">What a
  StoryBuilder Can <i>Do</i></a>, a description of the basics of
  the Skotos toolkit. Probably outdated by now.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_34.html">The
  Power of the Medium: Individualized Output</a> is chock-full of
  stuff that Phantasmal currently does nothing with, but eventually
  I'd love to.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_35.html">The
  Power of the Medium: Text!</a> tells us yet again that Shannon
  Appelcline knows damn well what makes MUDs excellent.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_48.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Rooms</a> begins the incredible Building Blocks series. Read
  them. Read them all.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_50.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Details</a>. This one is <i>extremely</i> relevant as we sketch
  out Phantasmal's details, which are currently probably <i>too</i>
  much like Skotos'.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_51.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Names</a>. Another brilliant article in the series.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_53.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Maps</a> has some lovely observations on mapping and
  consistency.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_54.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Zones</a> is definitely not the best of the bunch, but still
  quite valuable.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_57.shtml">Future
  Memes, Part Three: Settings and Physics</a>. Shannon throws a lot
  of curveballs to get you thinking. This is one I consider
  particularly Innsmouth-relevant.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_59.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Portables</a> is about a lot more than that. It explains some of
  why I've been merging so many types of Phantasmal objects with
  such zeal.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_60.shtml">Building Blocks:
  Data Inheritance</a> explains data inheritance and why it's not
  code inheritance. What I'm planning for Phantasmal has a lot in
  common with this, though with some subtleties and
  differences.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_61.shtml">Building Blocks
  Examples: The Hologram Nexus</a> puts all this Building Blocks
  stuff into practice. I recommend reading those articles first or
  it won't make that much sense.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_94.shtml">The
  Elements of Good ScaryTelling, Part One: Haunting Themes</a> My
  experience has been that to deal with subtle storytelling in
  online games, you quickly start talking about horror games. Even
  if that's not what you're building.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From "Notes from the Dawn of Time" by Richard Bartle</h3>

<ul>
  <li>His <a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/DAWNOF.shtml">article list</a> is
  on Skotos. Mainly he writes long series of articles, so no one
  individual article is as satisfyingly linkable as with Shannon
  Appelcline.</li>

  <li>His early stuff, from about 9/20/2001 to 11/28/2001 explains
  a lot of why regular inheritance (not data inheritance) is nifty
  but works indifferently for MUDs. Worth a read if you're thinking
  that what we need is massive inheritance.</li>

  <li>After that, from about 1/2/2002 to 7/3/2002, he analyzes
  parsing in fearsome detail.</li>

  <li>And then he works on mobile AI and planning, including having
  mobiles figure out what they need and give you quests based on
  it. That's as far as he's gotten.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From "MetaStatic " by Sam Witt</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sam Witt tends to briefly describe his ideas, with which I
  usually agree vigorously, but rarely goes into very much extra
  detail on them. So again, he doesn't have many articles that I
  find massively linkable.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic14.html">The Value of
  the Random Dungeon</a> describes a basic approach to building
  vast expanses. Overall I agree with it. We don't have SAM (or
  Sam) on Phantasmal, of course.</li>

  <li>The "Death of a Thousand Cuts" series is more specific,
  though, parts <a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic25.html">One</a>,
  <a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic26.html">Two</a>,
  <a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic27.html">Three</a> ,
  and <a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic28.html">Four</a> . I'm
  not sure if I'd take this approach, but I <i>know</i> I respect
  this approach to keeping player power manageable and the game
  running reasonably. It's the basis of a real object economy,
  among other reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From "Storms on Cloud Nine" by Scott Holliday</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Despite the name, <a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/storms06.shtml">Evil and
  Wickedness</a> is basically just a guide to creating decently
  believable NPCs within current AI constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My stuff!</h3>

<p>Since I've now got my own Skotos column, I may as well plug it.
NeoArchaeology is me, and I'll put these up as they go up. Well,
either that or I'll just put them up when I remember to...</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo1.phtml">Toys in
  the Attic</a> is my first column. It's a quick survey of free MUD
  development stuff.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo2.phtml">It's
  Based on Actual Math</a> is a run-down of how object descriptions
  get <i>big</i> if you write very many.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo3.phtml">Got A
  License For That?</a>, got posted to SlashDot (the commentary was
  thoroughly inane &mdash; did nobody <i>read</i> the article?).
  It's about license issues for MUD development, and how they're
  currently crippling it.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo4.phtml">Labor-Saving
  Devices</a> is a follow-up to 'It's Based on Actual Math', and
  describes how you can avoid having to write quite as much prose
  and still get good descriptions.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo5.phtml">Real
  Innovation</a> is about a whole lot of 'brand new' features that
  we don't need to see any more of, and a few we'd like to.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo6.phtml">Procedural Content
  Generation</a> is about trade-offs in having the MUD randomly
  generate areas for you. Read it if you're thinking about doing a
  large algorithmic wilderness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>From Delphine T. Lynx's "Daedalian Musing"</h3>

<p>The column isn't applicable to Phantasmal most weeks, but a
couple of the articles are very good and all are at least
tolerable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>His article <a href=
  "http://www.mudconnect.com/articles/dm/boo.html">Boo?</a> is a
  good explanation of how to start scaring players in your MUD. I
  agree with, oh, about 90% of it.</li>

  <li><a href=
  "http://www.mudconnect.com/articles/dm/dcrawl2.html">Dungeon
  Crawling?: Caves</a> is a summary of what makes caves interesting
  settings in a MUD. That's neither here nor there. But the same
  article has truly <i>excellent</i> unpredictable ways to get
  players into and out of MUD settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href=
  "http://www.kanga.nu/mirrors/mu.ranter.net/theory/">Mu's
  Unbelievably Long and Disjointed Ramblings About RPG Design</a>
  hits a little of everything. Game balance, what you have to do in
  a fantasy game to keep idiots happy, everything about medieval
  and fantasy objects and their economy, game design wisdom...
  Pretty much everything's excellent, but <i>do not</i>, under any
  circumstances, skip the <b>Food Basis</b> section. It's probably
  the best article anywhere on how medieval geography and
  agriculture holds together.</li>

  <li><a href="http://members.aol.com/essuncius/cover4.htm">Uncle
  Figgy's Guide to Good Fantasy</a> explores the 'realistic'
  effects of magic on a fantasy setting. It talks about various
  types and levels of magic, and the social effects that those
  magics would have on other professions.</li>
</ul>

Towns, Cities, Dungeons, Populations and Other Dynamic and
Alterable Systems</h3>

<p>Long title, that.</p>

<p>There's an old Holy Grail of MUD development that I think I have
a new take on: procedural content generation. It's easy to
geometrically generate landscapes, and even things like inns,
towns, cities and so on. Using an algorithmically simple generator
and enough domain-specific work you could build an entire city even
now, with modern techniques, and it's be okay. Not great, but okay.
So let's talk about some problems that currently occur and some
known and possible solutions.</p>

<p>Incidentally, a lot of this steals other people's ideas pretty
liberally. That's life. A list of some of my more prominent sources
for some of this can be found <a href="ProcWorld.html">here</a>.
I'll note in passing that J.C. Lawrence rocks, both for his ideas
and for running MUD-Dev so well and so long.</p>

<h3>I'm BORED!</h3>

<p>The first and simplest problem is that most modern procedural
content generators are boring. You put in a simple randomizer to
put down a house, a bakery, a guardhouse or whatever. But there are
only a small number of primitives that it puts down, and so the
systems get boring quickly. The problem here is that (at least
currently) procedural content generators (PCGs) don't actually save
you labor for a given amount of interest and storyline. You can
(indeed, you almost <i>have</i> to) combine PCGs with automated
quest generation of one kind or another, but overall it comes out
to just as much work, and often more, as if you'd simply designed
it all statically.</p>

<p>So why use them, if they're just as much work, or will be
boring? Two reasons. One is the reason that people believe they
will eventually save work: emergent behavior. This means that you
put some simple elements together (a smithy, a bakery, four houses,
three fields and a small laundry, say) and the system's behavior
seamlessly stitches the whole thing together into a coherent whole
(the neighbors chat on slow days, the mothers take clothes to the
laundry, the kids bring home day-old bread from the baker and get
their ears boxed for it). This is possible, but it's the equivalent
of what you'd get if you built a lot of settings like that and then
merged all the common code -- in other words, it's as much work as
doing it all statically, in the end. Still, it's a holy grail, it's
not supposed to be trivial.</p>

<p>The other reason to use dynamic content is that you may need a
lot of space, or for some other reason it may be beneficial to move
your content around unpredictably. A randomly-generated world with
only three different quests is just as boring as a static world
with only three different quests, but you may be able to get more
people doing your three boring quests at once if you have multiple
instances of each. That may not get you more interesting content
for less labor, but it <i>does</i> get the players to stop stepping
on each other's feet as they all race to give the dwarf his
randomized item.</p>

<p>This isn't really a solvable problem -- you only get as much
content as you generate, and while you can generate some of that
content as code (emergent behavior), you'll have to put at least as
much effort into the code as you would into more static content.
Also, remember that a lot of this stuff is domain-specific, meaning
you have to do it differently for different settings. So you
probably can't even hope that some genius will solve this problem
and post the results publicly -- there's a decent chance you
couldn't use them and you'd <i>still</i> have to do it yourself. In
the end, don't expect dynamic content generation to save you any
effort, though it might still make for a better result.</p>

<h3>This is STUPID!</h3>

<p>The next problem with modern PCGs is that they're pretty random.
If you just randomly place houses and fields, you may not wind up
with the right number of each. You'd prefer each farmer get a
field. If you randomize neighborhoods and buildings, you may have a
village with no farmers or a wealthy neighborhood with no guard
house, just randomly. This is another example of the axiom
"Procedural Content Generation will not save you any effort". In
the same way that you need to think of all this stuff and put
effort into it in your static maps, you also need to think of it
and put effort into it for your dynamic content generation. So
intelligent dynamic content generation is just as hard (and often
harder) as intelligent static content generation. Sorry, that's
just the way it is.</p>

<p>Similarly, players will recognize a lot of patterns that the PCG
will not, such as an arrangement of three houses in the same shape,
or the fact that three nearby villages each have a laundry and a
smithy but no bakery. This is essentially the same as the above --
intelligent PCGs require a lot of effort to write. Making sure that
there's a bakery within easy walking range of any populated area is
a good idea, and you should do it if you can, but it complicates
the PCG. Making people notice and remark on the architectural
similarities between towns (even if they're randomly-generated and
entirely a coincidence) takes a <i>lot</i> of work. There's a lot
of stuff that's just harder to do with a PCG, so to some extent
random content will seem somewhat "stupider" because there will
always be patterns in the data that the players recognize and the
MUD world does not. That's usually a pretty minor problem, though,
and you can fix it easily enough if you allow changes to the PCG's
output -- just manually fix up things like that to make NPCs remark
on it, or to scoot the houses around a bit.</p>

<h3>Nothing I Change Ever STAYS!</h3>

<p>And speaking of changing the PCG's output... One problem with
PCGs that operate on demand is that if a player makes a big change,
like killing an NPC or burning down a building, that change goes
away next time you run the PCG. To be fair, this criticism applies
to even static content in most modern MUDs, since few of them allow
you to change anything in the long term.</p>

<p>Many people have suggested a PCG/diff system where you can add a
few small differences to "patch" the PCG-generated system. Thus,
the amount of data you'd have to store about world would be equal
to what the PCG requires (pretty small, aside from the code and
data for the generator) plus all the data for all the alterations
that players make to the world. There are two problems with this --
simulation time and data creep.</p>

<p>Players expect their changes to "ripple" in the world -- if they
set up a bucket of water in a doorway as a practical joke, they'd
like to see the miller get soaked when he opens the door. If they
put poison in the well or blight the crops of the village, they'd
like to see the results of those actions. The problem with that is
that you have to spend time simulating not just everywhere that
players <i>are</i>, but everywhere that they <i>have been</i>,
since you'd want to see the results of those actions, and keep note
of the new deltas from the PCG stuff. You'll note that in the case
above, the results of poison or blight could easily make the deltas
keep getting larger (villagers die off, the survivors band together
and scratch out a living). Sadly, that's usually the case -- the
sort of changes that players like to make will echo, causing
ever-larger deltas. So you can't just simulate them for a short
time and stop, you have to do it forever. That makes your very
large world a liability as much as an asset...</p>

<p>Data creep is the problem above -- small changes tend to produce
more changes, which get bigger, and then bigger yet... In a
realistic system (one to which chaos theory applies, to be
specific), these small changes will snowball into larger changes
like a bad "B" time-travel movie.</p>

<p>Both of these problems, simulation time and data creep, are
often present in the PCG-based system <i>even before the players
arrive</i>. Imagine you use your spiffy new PCG to lay out a whole
bunch of world. You walk around it. You notice that the local
hooligan is being careless with matches. Unless you simulate this
neighborhood all the time, even when no players are watching, the
hooligan can only burn down the neighborhood when a player is
standing nearby. That's not realistic. Similarly, bread won't bake,
houses won't be built, etc unless you allow for that happening
without players nearby. That's the simulation-time problem again.
And when the players <i>are</i> standing nearby, stuff will happen
that is different from the PCG-generated bits (again, think of the
hooligan burning down the neighborhood) and you wind up with
exactly the data creep problem above. Not good.</p>

<h3>Some Solutions</h3>

<p>Bear in mind that most people running a MUD don't care if it's
an accurate simulation -- they just want it to be a good game. So
let's see if we can change some of our unstated assumptions and get
a result that works better than the above, and that solves some of
those problems. First, let's state those assumptions so we can
change them.</p>

<p>We're assuming above that the PCG-made world is either created
once and stays the same (bleah!) or we make it and then it's
supposed to carry on simulating itself, figuring out what it should
do at later times based on what it was before. In other words,
we're making it act like a simulation. As other people have pointed
out in many, many other places, there's a tradeoff between
simulation accuracy and gameplay. Since we don't actually give a
hoot about simulation accuracy in most games, let's trade some
accuracy for better gameplay.</p>

<p>Here's a simple variant: we can make our PCG take a time input
so that it makes the towns and cities evolve slowly. Maybe you can
tell from your PCG that the bakery is going to get bigger, several
farms are going to go broke and go away, and there's going to be a
smithy built nearby. That gives your characters attitudes, and
things to talk about. Bear in mind that you don't have to derive
those things from how business is doing -- maybe the baker is doing
well because he gets an inheritance, maybe the farmers are going
broke from gambling debts (even though the farms are doing just
fine). You don't have to derive those things from previous
conditions, you just need to come up with a reason for them --
you're sacrificing the accuracy of the simulation to get better
performance, better gameplay and (often) a better story.</p>

<p>Once you know where these things are going, you can work to make
differences get <i>smaller</i> instead of bigger -- you're going to
have to fudge why shops are built and destroyed anyway, just take
some of that into account. For very large changes (like the
neighborhood burning down) you can try changing the type of the
overall area, seeing if you can get a random seed that's more like
a burned-down neighborhood, or just accept that there'll be a very
large delta for awhile. Since you know the trends in most
neighborhoods, you don't have to do much simulation on them -- none
if there are no deltas, and remember that your deltas will keep
getting smaller as neighborhood residents pick up stray items,
rebuild damaged bits of buildings and so on.</p>

<p>It's not obvious how a PCG would manage this propagation forward
in time, so I'll suggest two major possibilities. I'm sure there
are others at least as good.</p>

<h3>Generate and Interpolate</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a good static PCG -- one that will generate you
a whole world, but not simulate it forward in time. If you can do
that, you could also have it generate (for each area) a condition
at one time, a condition at a later time, and then interpolate
between them. While this is a lot more work (you have to figure out
how and why businesses change, people move away, etc), you can do
it, and it'll give you a nice continuous world. And with work,
you'll have good activities going on all the time -- people coming
and going, businesses changing, etc.</p>

<h3>Feedback and Detail Adjustment</h3>

<p>This is a significantly different approach from the above, and
is likely to sit better with people who like simulations. Since all
of this is an alternative to static, hand-built content I'm not
worried about that :-)</p>

<p>Imagine that you keep track of a bunch of variables like the
population of a village, how well each business is doing and other
numerical data about families. When players are present in the
village, you can run the simulation at the level of individual
people (you have to anyway, so you might as well use the data) to
update these variables. However, when no players are present you
can use a simpler update formula. This is a simple problem in
differential equations, and well-known and well-tested methods like
Runge-Kutta will do most of your work for you if you design your
functions carefully.</p>

<p>Based on whether players are nearby, and how much of a delta you
have from the feedback model (again, remember that players can make
changes that you didn't account for) you pick a level of detail to
simulate. Perhaps you run the full model, just as if a player was
there. Or perhaps you run a differential equations model with most
of the same variables (it'll still be faster than having to update
all your data structures) and just figure out where everybody is,
from those variables, when a player shows up to look around. And as
time goes by and you're sure that players don't care about the
place much (they haven't been anywhere around for awhile) you can
drop detail -- a model with a variable for every citizen becomes
one with a variable for every social group, say, so that you can
simulate a village with about three variables, a city with six or
seven, and a metropolis with no more than twenty or thirty.
Eventually you can get rid of even that and let it be randomly
generated again if anybody ever shows up, just like you do with all
the areas of your (infinite?) map that have never been visited
before. Then, when you need more detail (again, when a player shows
up), you can regenerate those variables and the city, which has
changed a lot -- but it <i>should</i> have, no player has been near
it in a long time. They've been busy building and tearing down, and
people have immigrated, emigrated or died...</p>

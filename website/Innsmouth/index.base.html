<h2 style="text-align: center">Innsmouth MUD</h2>

<p>Innsmouth is a decaying Massachusetts town that hides a terrible
secret. Like a snowball becoming an avalanche, like a lie that
hides itself in larger lies, so has the Shadow Over Innsmouth bred
new terrors. The Shadow waits for you to explore this tiny,
decrepit and terrified New England town.</p>

<p>Innsmouth MUD is inspired by the story "The Shadow Over
Innsmouth" by H. P. Lovecraft, and other short stories. It was
built as a test MUD for the <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">Phantasmal</a> MUD Library.</p>

<p>In its current condition, it isn't meant to be a full-on
Lovecraft experience in MUD form. Rather, it's a set of interesting
vignettes meant to showcase Phantasmal's abilities. I hope to
produce something worthy of the gentleman from Providence
eventually, but that's a long-term goal.</p>

<p>You can find some of <a href=
"http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/index.html">Lovecraft's
work</a> on the web. My understanding is that his stuff is no
longer under copyright due to failure to renew on the part of
Arkham Press (and on his own behalf). The Gizmology.net Lovecraft
Archive seems to be down, or I'd link to <span style=
"background-color: #CCCCCC;" title=
"http://www.ech-pi-el.com/lovecraft/works/index.htm">that
one</span>, and the note on <a href=
"LovecraftCopyright.html">copyrights</a> to the stories. You could
check the Wayback Machine for them, I guess.</p>

<h1> CthulhuMUD Immortal Policies </h1>
<h2> (Reproduced here for the edification of Innsmouth MUD, with the
     understanding that they are merely for inspiration) </h2>

<p><strong><big>Becoming an Immortal:</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to become an immortal is to Not Ask For
It. Offer a
suggestion for an area. Build it with Arcanum once you find out if we're
interested. The
senior staff will look over the area file once you've got it done and then
you'll get a
creator character to build with.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you can become a complete builder you have to
know how to build
the more complex, mobprogs and confirm that you understand the basic
commands. We will
teach you this. Also tutorials on those commands can be found at this
webpage, and feel
free to ask anyone for help if you need it. To make sure that you know
the commands you'll
be asked to fix a series of problems in a set of test rooms. Use every help
you need to
learn the commands, even asking the imm running the test for help if you
need to, it won't
be held against you. Just so long as you learn the commands eventually,
we don't care how.</p>


<p><strong><big>Staying an Immortal:</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just creating one area is not really enough to
validate staying on
as an immortal on a permanent basis, especially if you don't plan to
dedicate yourself to
any further building. Having a creator character, as most of the senior
imms will tell you
isn't so much a reward as it is a job. So, the best way to *keep* your
imm character is to
build your first area quickly and to specifications, and then, suggest
and grid out
another area. Hard work will get you there, as will showing responsibility
and understanding of the mud.</p>


<p><strong><big>Promotion as an Immortal:</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most imms will remain on a one-shot or full-time
builder status.
This isn't to say we don't trust you. merely that that is the job we
need you for. A few
imms will be raised to a higher level of security or command. This is
because the top imms
can't be on all the time, and it's always handy for folks to have someone
to go to when we
aren't on. Promotion is entirely at the whim of the top level imms. All of
them should
agree on the need for the position and on the appointment. Those imms with
those higher
securities are not given those powers as toys, they are given them because
the senior
staff wants you to use them to aid in the administration of the mud.</p>

<p><strong><big>What Immortal Rank Means:</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vast majority of this is simply formality.
The actual running of
the mud, as most of the current imm staff knows is largely laid-back,
and all opinions are
welcomed and considered. The rank system is not designed to stifle any
of the cooperation
we currently have.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are four levels of rank in immortal status:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Senior Staff</li>
  <li>God Staff</li>
  <li>Full-time Builder</li>
  <li>One-shot Builder</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior staff run the mud by their whim and good
graces. The senior
staff consists of: Yog, Tsa, Shub, and Bast. For obvious reasons,
barring critical need,
this is not a rank that is available to promotion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God staff includes those imms who have been given a
specific task in
the administration of the mud. Be this the power of enforcer,
administration, or quest
running, this is a rank that should be respected. They have authority
within their field
and should be aware of their responsibility. God staff and above are free
to take clan
requests for building, though obviously all changes should be documented
so we know what
request have been filled and what price was charged to the society.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full-time builders are those builders who are known
to be reliable and
creative with their areas. They are under less pressure to produce an
area quickly,
because we know they'll get it done eventually. Most imms will be
considered full-time
builders. The majority of a full-time builder's attention should be on
their area(s) but
goof-off time and roleplay is encouraged.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-shot builders are those currently in the process
of proving their
reliability. A one-shot builder should concentrate their attention on
their area for the
majority of time online with the imm character.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All builders can feel free to correct errors they see
within their own
areas after it has been opened, or contact someone regarding the error
if they are not
full-time yet.</p>


<p><strong><big>Demotion as an Immortal:</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to lose immortal rank is to ask for it.
Asking for it
of course means: blatant disregard of the rules in creation of an area,
blatant disregard
of the ethics involved in running both an immortal and mortal character
at the same time,
or blatant disregard of commands from the senior staff. Basically, don't
cheat in favor of
your mortal character. Don't abuse your power in either promoting other
characters, or
abuse it in the form of harassment or other forms of punishment to
mortals. Don't be a
jerk with your powers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process of demotion goes as this, it is rare that
any immortal
above the rank of full-time builder will ever be demoted, however in
general: You will be
warned first regarding whatever rule is being broken. As you are demoted,
whatever power
was abused will be removed. If this involves removing the immortal
character entirely, so
be it. Deletion of mortal characters and site banning is for extreme
cases, those cases in
which the demoted immortal simply can't let enough alone even after
being removed from
power.</p>


<p><strong><big>What NOT to do:</big></strong></a> 

<ol>
  <li>Do not allow equipment from unopened areas to be used by any
    mortal character. You don't
    have to be mean about removing it from them, but explain to them it 
    is equipment that is
    currently banned from use.</li>
  <li>Do not open your area without first gaining approval and a
    walk-through by senior staff.
    (This covers your ass as much as ours, so you can honestly say if a
    problem arises later
    that no one caught it on the walk-through.)</li>
  <li>Do not build in other areas without notifying either the builder
    of that area or a
    member of the senior staff. <strong>This includes clan halls.</strong>
    </li>
  <li>Do not use your immortal to aid your mortal character in any way.
    (Such aid may be
    interpreted as: taking your mortal character leveling with the
    immortal, giving your
    mortal character equipment, gold, spell-ups, experience, fame, deeds
    or other benefits
    including using the GOTO command for the mortal's transportation on
    a routine basis.)</li>
  <li>Do not harass players that as a mortal you do not care for. You
    are running the mud,
    hence you need a certain amount of objectivity. On the other hand,
    if they *are* doing
    something wrong, don't ignore it, handle it properly. Log it.</li>
  <li>Do not vary in the creation of equipment from the basics given here.
    If you wish to
    create something more spectacular, ask one of the senior staff
    (preferably Bast) for
    approval. If it is inappropriate as it stands she will be able to
    suggest ways of balancing
    it out.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><big>What To do:</big></strong></a> 

<ol>
  <li>Work on whatever project you've been assigned to do.</li>
  <li>When a crash occurs, ask the players what happened, and see if
    you can determine what
    caused it. If you can figure it out, post a note regarding it to the
    imm board.</li>
  <li>If a player requires administrative handling (punishment for
    spamming, harassment or a
    rename), attempt to find an imm with the authority to handle it, or
    handle it yourself. If
    neither is possible, then post a note on imm board regarding it and
    try to tame the
    situation. When we see the note we'll handle it. In the more extravagant
    cases
    (multi-char, harassment, or spamming) please post a note on imm board
    about it even if you
    yourself can handle it, so when any imm sees it again they know it's
    a repeat offense.</li>
  <li>Be fair to the players, but remember game balance. You are allowed
    to give occasional
    spell-ups if you're in a good mood or they do good RP, but don't over
    do it.</li>
  <li>Recognize when a higher up makes a decision. Unless you can come up
    with a further
    compelling argument, decisions tend to be final when the senior staff
    decides on them.</li>
  <li>Read! Read Lovecraft, read the CoC books, read the collections
    of short stories written
    in the style of Lovecraft, and stay on alert for good settings or
    inspirations. The latest
    House on Haunted Hill for instance does a very good Shub
    impersonation. And feel free to
    incorporate this into your settings.</li>
  <li>Have fun with yourself! Don't take the job *that* seriously!!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><big>Roleplaying:</big></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roleplaying is when we decide to goof off. The
   random cloud fights,
cat tail pulling, couch scratching, Adam abusing, goat gluing, punch
spiking psudopod mess
that we produce when on caffeine, is amusing to both player and imm,
and contributes to
the developing history of the mud. (If you aren't aware of the incidents
listed above...
it's probably for the best. :) )<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So of course, we want to encourage roleplaying on
even an immortal
level. An imm name will set the tone for the roleplay so it's important
to pick one with a
history and personality you can convincingly play. We do try to have
immortals select
Cthulhu mythos, Sumerian, or Egyptian names. Other names are welcome
as well, but
researching a little bit of the history to them so you can easily fit
into the immortal RP
would be nice. As a last note, unless you plan on sticking around for
awhile you probably
don't want to get too deeply entrenched in the lives of the players.
Their opinion won't
keep a one-shot builder on if there's nothing else to keep the immortal
for, so it's
setting them up for disappointment when their deity disappears.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best opportunities for RP as an immortal are
either with other
immortals (see above), or with their own worshippers. Worshippers should
be played with to
the extent that *they* wish to play. Never try to coerce a character
to follow you without
making it clear this is RP only, it makes the player nervous otherwise,
and that's the
last thing we want to do to them. Be as subtle, rewarding, extravagant
as you want to be,
everyone should get a kick out of it. In fact, it might be fun for some
of them to develop
a working theology for your immortal to use as a standard for testing
the roleplaying
abilities of a worshipper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spell-ups or future attention are the typical reward
of good
roleplaying. Rarely a character will complete an extravagant quest for
a reward. For
example: I once requested the head of a Hound of Tindalos, from a level
20 character. 40
levels later I got the head, having totally forgotten about the quest
myself. *That* is
dedication. For this the character received a very nice statue, along
with the mention
that if it ever left his grasp he would die, repeatedly. Such bonuses are
not unheard of,
but should be *extremely* rare. Consult the senior staff regarding it
first. Experience
should not be used as an RP award.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain characters wish to RP more interesting
materials with their
deities or with other players. *cough*Caroline*cough* *ahem*. Such
activities should not
be performed in a well traveled room, and should be done with the clear
understanding ooc
of safety. If one of the characters requests ooc that the RP stop, it
should stop right
then and there. There have been incidents between two player characters
before that ended
with the banning of a harassing player. Use discretion and common
sense. And there is a
vnum specifically for these activities if they indicate the need to
'get a room'. Room

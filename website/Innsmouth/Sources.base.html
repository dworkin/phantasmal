<h2 style="text-align: center">Innsmouth MUD's Sources and
Policies</h2>

<p>Chaosium materials aren't the definitive source for Lovecraft
stuff. The phrase "Cthulhu Mythos" refers to a collection not only
of Lovecraft's work, but also of several others' -- Ramsey
Campbell, August Derleth, and Brian Lumley for instance. Certain
aspects of the other writers' stories may clash with the bleak
horror of Lovecraft's original settings. Like Chaosium, Innsmouth
MUD restricts itself specifically to the fiction we feel is
appropriate for our use. However, we're mostly limiting ourselves
to the works of the Gentleman from Providence himself.</p>

<p>Any unintended deviations in Innsmouth MUD from the actual works
by Lovecraft will be corrected if players point them out. But bear
in mind that not all settings are in exactly the situation
described by Lovecraft. For instance, not every day would see Zadok
Allen out to look for a tourist. But we try to maintain things in a
condition where Lovecraft's stories <i>could be</i> a snapshot of
our setting, probably at a different time. Day-to-day deviations
are fine -- if Joe Sargent's bus isn't in the town square at
midnight, or one day it happens to be broken down, we consider that
a feature and not a bug.</p>

<p>There are aspects of the Chaosium materials I try not to use.
Mostly, they're the parts not derived directly from Lovecraft or
from actual 1920s history. That's for legal reasons as much as
anything else. I greatly respect Chaosium and I have no wish to
steal their intellectual property. However, I'd also prefer to
avoid gratuitous differences. For instance, if we ever do Arkham
we'll also use Gahan Wilson's street map. But Chaosium materials
aren't definitive in Innsmouth MUD, not about situations, locations
and horrors, and certainly not about what characters live at what
street addresses. Deviations from Chaosium's source material are
expected and encouraged.</p>

<p>For those of you who have played CthulhuMUD: I have no plans to
allow the playing of Shoggoths, Mi-Go, Deep Ones, Yithians (Great
Race), Zoogs or other nonhuman races any time soon. Having a class
of players whose primary purpose involves hunting and killing human
beings fits very poorly into my current plans for the MUD. I may
eventually consider adding something of this kind in a very
limited, very roleplaying-specific capacity. But even in that case
it would have very little in common with, say, the CthulhuMUD
"mi-go brain hunter" class.</p>

<p>Also for those of you who played CthulhuMUD: I like and respect
many of the policies they maintained. For instance, those about
newbie-harassment, in-character versus out-of-character
interaction, and cheating. CthulhuMUD and Blood Dusk have the
policies I most respect of the MUDs I've played, and the policies
that have lent the most to the feel of the game. Expect some
similarities. Also, expect some differences.</p>

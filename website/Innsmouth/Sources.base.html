<h2 style="text-align: center"> Innsmouth MUD's Sources and Policies </h2>

<p> Chaosium materials aren't the
  definitive source for Lovecraft stuff.
  The phrase &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; refers to a collection not
  only of Lovecraft's work, but also of several others' --
  Ramsey Campbell, August Derleth, and Brian Lumley for instance.
  Certain aspects of the other writers' stories
  may clash with the bleak horror of Lovecraft's original
  settings.  Like Chaosium, Innsmouth MUD
  restricts itself specifically to the fiction
  we feel is appropriate for our use.  However, we're mostly
  limiting ourselves to the works of the Gentleman from Providence
  himself.
</p>

<p> Any unintended deviations in Innsmouth MUD from
  the actual works by
  Lovecraft will be corrected if players point them out.
  But bear in mind that not all
  settings are in exactly the situation described by Lovecraft.  For
  instance, not every day would see Zadok Allen out to look for a
  tourist.  But we try to maintain things in a condition where
  Lovecraft's stories <i>could be</i> a snapshot of our setting,
  probably at a different time.  Day-to-day deviations are
  fine -- if Joe Sargent's bus isn't in the town square at midnight,
  or one day it happens to be broken down, we consider that a feature and
  not a bug. </p>

<p> There are aspects of the Chaosium materials I try not to use.
  Mostly, they're the parts not
  derived directly from Lovecraft or from actual 1920s history.
  That's for legal reasons as much as anything else.  I greatly
  respect Chaosium and I have no wish to steal their intellectual
  property.  However, I'd also prefer to avoid gratuitous
  differences.  For instance, if we ever do Arkham we'll also use
  Gahan Wilson's street map.  But Chaosium materials aren't
  definitive in Innsmouth MUD, not about situations, locations
  and horrors, and certainly not about what characters live at what
  street addresses.  Deviations
  from Chaosium's source material are expected and encouraged.
</p>

<p> For those of you who have played CthulhuMUD:  I have no
  plans to allow the playing of Shoggoths, Mi-Go, Deep Ones,
  Yithians (Great Race), Zoogs or other nonhuman races
  any time soon.  Having a class of players whose primary
  purpose involves hunting and killing human beings fits very
  poorly into my current plans for the MUD.  I may eventually
  consider adding something of this kind in a very limited,
  very roleplaying-specific capacity.  But even in that case
  it would have very little in common with, say, the
  CthulhuMUD &quot;mi-go brain hunter&quot; class. </p>

<p> Also for those of you who played CthulhuMUD:  I like
  and respect many of the policies they maintained.
  For instance, those about newbie-harassment, in-character versus
  out-of-character interaction, and cheating.  CthulhuMUD
  and Blood Dusk have the policies I most respect of the
  MUDs I've played, and the policies that have lent the most
  to the feel of the game.  Expect some similarities.  Also,
  expect some differences.

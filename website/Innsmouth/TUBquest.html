<h1> How to make good quests </h1>

<p> <i>Ellery: The text below was adapted by me for TubMud. Don't feel
  irritated by the occasional references to it and my having a
  different character name there. Also, don't worry about the
  patronizing mood I employ in the notes every now and then -
  this text is meant to enforce a mud policy on TubMud, it's only
  a source of ideas here on Nanny.
</i> </p>

<p><i>
  Macbeth: This is taken from the manual of a compiler for INFOCOM-like
  games. And while muds are different from text adventures, they have
  still enough in common to use similar design criteria for them. Besides,
  it is a very good text.
</i></p>

<hr />

<h2>1. A Bill of Player's Rights </h2>

<p>
  Perhaps the most important point about designing a game is to think
  as a player and not a designer.  I think the least a player deserves
  is:
</p>

<h3>    1.  Not to be killed without warning </h3>

<p>
  At its most basic level, this means that a room with three exits,
  two of which lead to instant death and the third to treasure, is
  unreasonable without some hint.  Mention of which brings us to:
</p>

<h3>    2.  Not to be given horribly unclear hints </h3>

<p>
  Many years ago, I played a game in which going north from a cave led
  to a lethal pit.  The hint was: there was a pride of lions carved
  above the doorway.  Good hints can be skilfully hidden, or very
  brief (I think, for example, the hint in the moving-rocks plain
  problem in "Spellbreaker" is a masterpiece) but should not need
  explaining even after the event.  A more sophisticated version of
  (1) leads us to:
</p>

<h3>    3.  To be able to win without experience of past lives </h3>

<p>
  Suppose, for instance, there is a nuclear bomb buried under some
  anonymous floor somewhere, which must be disarmed.  It is
  unreasonable to expect a player to dig up this floor purely because
  in previous games, the bomb blew up there.  To take a more concrete
  example, in &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot; there is something which needs
  cooking for the right length of time.  As far as I can tell, the
  only way to find out the right time is by trial and error.  But you
  only get one trial per game.  In principle a good player should be
  able to play the entire game out without doing anything illogical.
  In similar vein:
</p>

<h3>    4.  To be able to win without knowledge of future events </h3>

<p>
  For example, the game opens near a shop.  You have one coin and can
  buy a lamp, a magic carpet or a periscope.  Five minutes later you
  are transported away without warning to a submarine, whereupon you
  need a periscope.  If you bought the carpet, bad luck.
</p>

<h3>    5.  Not to have the game closed off without warning </h3>

<p>
  Closed off meaning that it would become impossible to proceed at
  some later date.  If there is a papier-mache wall which you can walk
  through at the very beginning of the game, it is extremely annoying
  to find that a puzzle at the very end requires it to still be
  intact, because every one of your saved games will be useless.
  Similarly it is quite common to have a room which can only be
  visited once per game.  If there are two different things to be
  accomplished there, this should be hinted at.
</p>

<h3>    6.  Not to need to do unlikely things </h3>

<p>
  For example, a game which depends on asking a policeman about
  something he could not reasonably know about.  (Less extremely, the
  problem of the hacker's keys in &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot;.)
  Another unlikely thing is waiting in uninteresting places.  If you
  have a junction such that after five turns an elf turns up and gives
  you a magic ring, a player may well never spend five turns there and
  never solve what you intended to be straightforward.  On the other
  hand, if you were to put something which demanded investigation in
  the junction, it might be fair enough.  (&quot;Zork III&quot; is
  especially poor in this respect.)
</p>

<h3>    7.  Not to need to do boring things for the sake of it </h3>

<p>
  In the bad old days many games would make life difficult by putting
  objects needed to solve a problem miles away from where the problem
  was, despite all logic - say, putting a boat in the middle of a
  desert.  Or, for example, it might be fun to have a four-discs tower
  of Hanoi puzzle in a game.  But not an eight-discs one.
</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: This applies to mazes as well. However, they are
  somewhat different.  See the section on mazes below for more
  information.</i></p>

<h3>    8.  Not to have to type exactly the right verb </h3>

<p>
  For instance, looking inside a box finds nothing, but searching it
  does.  Or consider the following dialogue (amazingly, from
  &quot;Sorcerer&quot;):
</p>

<pre>
    >unlock journal
    (with the small key)
    No spell would help with that!

    >open journal
    (with the small key)
    The journal springs open.
</pre>

<p>
  This is so misleading as to constitute a bug.  But it's an easy
  design fault to fall into.  (Similarly, the wording needed to use
  the brick in Zork II strikes me as quite unfair.  Or perhaps I
  missed something obvious.)
</p>

<h3>    9.  To be allowed reasonable synonyms </h3>

<p>
  In the same room in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is a &quot;woven wall
  hanging&quot; which can instead be called &quot;tapestry&quot;
  (though not &quot;curtain&quot;).  This is not a luxury, it's an
  essential.
</p>

<h3>    10.  To have a decent parser </h3>

<p>
  This goes without saying.  At the very least it should provide for
  taking and dropping multiple objects.
</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Unfortunately, the parser is the weakest spot of every
  LPmud so far. There isn't much you can do about it. I'm currently
  thinking about a way of making better parsing easier.</i></p>

<p> <strong> The last few are more a matter of taste, but I believe in
  them: </strong> </p>

<h3>    11.  To have reasonable freedom of action </h3>

<p>
  Being locked up in a long sequence of prisons, with only brief
  escapes between them, is not all that entertaining.  After a while
  the player begins to feel that the designer has tied him to a chair
  in order to shout the plot at him.
</p>

<p> <i>Macbeth: Likewise for MUDs. Too often quest designers choose
  the easy way out by making a room teleport-proof and blocking all
  exits until the victim has been told the entire story.</i> </p>

<h3>    12.  Not to depend much on luck </h3>

<p>
  Small chance variations add to the fun, but only small ones.  The
  thief in &quot;Zork I&quot; seems to me to be just about right in
  this respect, and similarly the spinning room in &quot;Zork
  II&quot;.  But a ten-ton weight which fell down and killed you at a
  certain point in half of all games is just annoying.
</p>

<h3>    13.  To be able to understand a problem once it is solved </h3>

<p>
  This may sound odd, but many problems are solved by accident or
  trial and error.  A guard-post which can be passed only if you are
  carrying a spear, for instance, ought to have some indication that
  this is why you're allowed past.  (The most extreme example must be
  the notorious Bank of Zork.)
</p>

<h3>    14.  Not to be given too many red herrings </h3>

<p>
  A few red herrings make a game more interesting.  A very nice
  feature of &quot;Zork I&quot;, &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; is
  that they each contain red herrings explained in the others (in one
  case, explained in &quot;Sorcerer&quot;).  But difficult puzzles
  tend to be solved last, and the main technique players use is to
  look at their maps and see what's left that they don't understand.
  This is frustrated when there are many insoluble puzzles and useless
  objects.  So you can expect players to lose interest if you aren't
  careful.  My personal view is that red herrings ought to have some
  clue provided (even only much later): for instance, if there is a
  useless coconut near the beginning, then perhaps much later an
  absent-minded botanist could be found who wandered about dropping
  them.  The coconut should at least have some rationale.
</p>

<p> The very worst game I've played for red herrings is
  &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, which by my reckoning has 10. </p>

<h3>    15.  To have a good reason why something is impossible </h3>

<p>
  Unless it's also funny, a very contrived reason why something is
  impossible just irritates.  (The reason one can't walk on the grass
  in &quot;Trinity&quot; is only just funny enough, I think.)
</p>

<h3>    16.  Not to need to be American to understand hints </h3>

<p>
  The diamond maze in &quot;Zork II&quot; being a case in point.
  Similarly, it's polite to allow the player to type English or
  American spellings or idiom.  For instance &quot;Trinity&quot;
  endears itself to English players in that the soccer ball can be
  called &quot;football&quot; - soccer is a word almost never used in
  England.
</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: I cannot stress this point enough. Currently, nine out of ten
  players who play TubMud are native German speakers and not used to the
  intricacies of the English language.</i></p>

<h3>    17.  To know how the game is getting on </h3>

<p>
  In other words, when the end is approaching, or how the plot is
  developing.  Once upon a time, score was the only measure of this,
  but hopefully not any more.
</p>

<hr />

<h2> 2. What makes a good game? </h2>

<h3>1.  The Plot </h3>

<p>
  The days of games which consisted of wandering around doing
  unrelated things to get treasures, are long passed: the original
  Adventure was fun, and so was Zork, but two such games are enough.
  There should be some overall task to be achieved, and it ought to be
  apparent to the player in advance.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't to say that it should be apparent at once.  Instead, one
  can begin with just an atmosphere or mood.  But if so, there must be
  a consistent style throughout and this isn't easy to keep up.
  &quot;The Lurking Horror&quot; is an excellent example of a
  successful genre style; so is &quot;Leather Goddesses of
  Phobos&quot;.
</p>

<p>
  At its most basic, this means there should be no electric drills
  lying about in a medieval-style fantasy.  The original Adventure was
  very clean in this respect, whereas Zork was less so: I think this
  is why Adventure remains the better game even though virtually
  everything in Zork was individually better.
</p>

<p>
  If the chosen genre isn't fresh and relatively new, then the game
  had better be very good.
</p>

<p>
  Plot begins with the opening message, rather the way an episode of
  Star Trek begins before the credits come up.  It ought to be
  striking and concise (not an effort to sit through, like the title
  page of &quot;Beyond Zork&quot;).  By and large Infocom were good at
  this.  A fine example is the overture to &quot;Trinity&quot; (by
  Brian Moriarty):
</p>

<p>
  Sharp words between the superpowers. Tanks in East Berlin. And now,
  reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite blackout. It's enough to
  spoil your continental breakfast.
</p>

<p>
  But the world will have to wait. This is the last day of your $599
  London Getaway Package, and you're determined to soak up as much of
  that authentic English ambience as you can. So you've left the tour
  bus behind, ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park for a
  contemplative stroll through the Kensington Gardens.
</p>

<p>
  Already you know: who you are (an unadventurous American tourist, of
  no significance in the world); exactly where you are (Kensington
  Gardens, Hyde Park, London, England); and what is going on (World
  War III is about to break out).  Notice the careful details: mention
  of the BBC, of continental breakfasts, of the camera and the tour
  bus.  More subtly, &quot;Trinity&quot; is a game which starts as a
  kind of escapism from a disastrous world out of control: notice the
  way the first paragraph is in tense, blunt, headline-like sentences,
  whereas the second is much more relaxed.  So a lot has been achieved
  by these two opening paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
  The most common plots boil down to saving the world, by exploring
  until eventually you vanquish something (&quot;Lurking Horror&quot;
  again, for instance) or collecting some number of objects hidden in
  awkward places (&quot;Leather Goddesses&quot; again, say).  The
  latter can get very hackneyed (got to find the nine magic spoons of
  Zenda to reunite the Kingdom...), so much so that it becomes a bit
  of a joke (&quot;Hollywood Hijinx&quot;) but still it isn't a bad
  idea, because it enables many different problems to be open at once.
</p>

<p>
  Most games have a prologue, a middle game and an end game, which are
  usually quite closed off from each other.  Usually once one of these
  phases has been left, it cannot be returned to.
</p>

<p><i> Macbeth: Well, you haven't much of a choice where the genre is
  concerned, TubMud having wizrule #8 and a generic fantasy
  setting. All the more reason to invest some amount of thinking in
  the plot.</i></p>

<h3>2.  The Prologue </h3>

<p>
  In establishing an atmosphere, the prologue gives a good head start.
  In the original mainframe Adventure, this was the above-ground
  landscape; the fact that it was there gave a much greater sense of
  claustrophobia and depth to the underground bulk of the game.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes a dream-sequence is used (for instance, in &quot;Lurking
  Horror&quot;), or sometimes simply a more mundane region of game
  (for instance, the guild-house in &quot;Sorcerer&quot;).  It should
  not be too large or too hard.
</p>

<p>
  As well as establishing the mood of the game, and giving out some
  background information, the prologue has to attract a player enough
  to make him carry on playing.  It's worth imagining that the player
  is only toying with the game at this stage, and isn't drawing a map
  or being at all careful.  If the prologue is big, the player will
  quickly get lost and give up.  If it is too hard, then many players
  simply won't reach the middle game.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps eight to ten rooms is the largest a prologue ought to be,
  and even then it should have a simple (easily remembered) map
  layout.
</p>

<p><i> Macbeth: In TubMud, there should also be a more or less obvious
  point where to start. In addition, you may try to write a quest with
  several possible starting points. Or one, where two players have to
  start at different locations.</i></p>

<h3>3.  The Middle Game </h3>

<p>
  A useful exercise is to draw out a tree (or more accurately a
  lattice) of all the puzzles in a game.  At the top is a node
  representing the start of the game, and then lower nodes represent
  solved puzzles.  An arrow is drawn between two puzzles if one has to
  be solved before the other can be.  For instance, a simple portion
  might look like:
</p>
<pre>
                       Start
                      /     \
                     /       \
              Find key     Find car
                     \        |
                      \       |
                       Start car
                           |
                           |
                     Reach motorway
</pre>
<p>
This is useful because it checks that the game is soluble (for example, if
the ignition key had been kept in a phone box on the motorway, it wouldn't
have been) but also because it shows the overall structure of the game.
The questions to ask are:
</p>

  <ul>
  <li>How much is visible at once?</li>
  <li>Do large parts of the game depend on one difficult puzzle?</li>
  <li>How many steps does a typical problem need?</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Some games, such as the original Adventure, are very wide: there are
  thirty or so puzzles, all easily available, none leading to each
  other.  Others, such as &quot;Spellbreaker&quot;, are very narrow: a
  long sequence of puzzles, each of which leads only to a chance to
  solve the next.
</p>

<p>
  A compromise is probably best.  Wide games are not very interesting,
  while narrow ones can in a way be easy: if only one puzzle is
  available at a time, the player will just concentrate on it, and
  will not be held up by trying to use objects which are provided for
  different puzzles.
</p>

<p>
  Bottlenecks should be avoided unless they are reasonably guessable:
  otherwise many players will simply get no further.
</p>

<p>
  Puzzles ought not to be simply a matter of typing in one well-chosen
  line.  One hallmark of a good game is not to get any points for
  picking up an easily-available key and unlocking a door with it.
  This sort of low-level achievement - like wearing an overcoat found
  lying around, for instance - should not be enough.  A memorable
  puzzle will need several different ideas to solve (the Babel fish
  dispenser in &quot;Hitch-hikers&quot;, for instance).
</p>

<h3>4.  Density </h3>

<p>
  Once upon a time, the sole measure of quality in advertisements for
  adventure games was the number of rooms.  Even quite small programs
  would have 200 rooms, which meant only minimal room descriptions and
  simple puzzles which were scattered thinly over the map.
</p>

<p>
  Nowadays a healthier principle has been adopted: that (barring a few
  junctions and corridors) there should be something out of the
  ordinary about every room.
</p>

<p>
  One reason for the quality of the &quot;Infocom&quot; games is that
  the version 3 system has an absolute maximum of 255 objects, which
  needs to cover rooms, objects and many other things (eg, compass
  directions, or the spells in &quot;Enchanter&quot; et al).  Many
  &quot;objects&quot; are not portable anyway: walls, tapestries,
  thrones, control panels, coal-grinding machines and so on.
</p>

<p>
  As a rule of thumb, four objects to one room is about right: this
  means there will be, say, 50-60 rooms.  Of the remaining 200
  objects, one can expect 15-20 to be used up by the game's
  administration (eg, a &quot;darkness&quot; room, 10 compass
  directions, a player and so on).  Another 50-75 or so objects will
  be portable but the largest number, at least 100, will be furniture.
</p>

<p>
  So an object limit can be a blessing as well as a curse: it forces
  the designer to make the game dense.  Rooms are too precious to be
  wasted.
</p>

<p><i> Macbeth: Did I ever mention that I hated those (n+1)-rooms
  quests with nothing in them? Quantos's maze, albeit not an official
  quest, is probably the worst example.  Moreover, you shouldn't make
  your quest too long. It probably will get too boring after some
  time.</i> </p>

<h3>5.  Rewards </h3>

<p>
  There are two kinds of reward which need to be given to a player in
  return for solving a puzzle.  One is obvious: that the game should
  advance a little.  But the player at the keyboard needs a reward as
  well, that the game should offer something new to look at.  In the
  old days, when a puzzle was solved, the player simply got a bar of
  gold and had one less puzzle to solve.
</p>

<p> <i>Macbeth: This is a bit more tricky in TubMud, with all our
  problems with quests handing out tons of gold and special items. You
  should think twice before handing out any material rewards. Some
  experience points would of course be a better idea. But be careful
  not to unbalance the game.</i> </p>

<p>
  Much better is to offer the player some new rooms and objects to
  play with, as this is a real incentive.  If no new rooms are on
  offer, at least the &quot;treasure&quot; objects can be made
  interesting, like the spells in the &quot;Enchanter&quot; trilogy or
  the cubes in &quot;Spellbreaker&quot;.
</p>

<h3>6.  Mazes </h3>

<p>
  Almost every game contains a maze.  Nothing nowadays will ever equal
  the immortal <em> You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
</em>
</p>

<p>
  But now we are all jaded.  A maze should offer some twist which
  hasn't been done before (the ones in &quot;Enchanter&quot; and
  &quot;Sorcerer&quot; being fine examples).
</p>

<p>
  The point is not to make it hard and boring.  The standard maze
  solution is to litter the rooms with objects in order to make the
  rooms distinguishable.  It's easy enough to obstruct this, the thief
  in &quot;Zork I&quot; being about the wittiest way of doing so.  But
  that only makes a maze tediously difficult.
</p>

<p>
  Instead there should be an elegant quick solution: for instance a
  guide who needs to be bribed, or fluorescent arrows painted on the
  floor which can only be seen in darkness (plus a hint about
  darkness, of course).
</p>

<p>
  Above all, don't design a maze which appears to be a standard
  impossibly hard one: even if it isn't, a player may lose heart and
  give up rather than go to the trouble of mapping it.
</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: YES. Maybe that's a personal quirk of mine, but I
  resent mapping mazes as part of a quest. This usually (though not
  always) means that the author was lacking the imagination to come up
  with something more original. But of course it is perfectly
  acceptable to send somebody on a wild-goose chase through a maze if
  he was too stupid to figure out an easier way.</i> </p>

<h3>7.  Wrong guesses </h3>

<p>
  For some puzzles, a perfectly good alternative solution will occur
  to players.  It's good style to code two or more solutions to the
  same puzzle, if that doesn't upset the rest of the game.  But even
  if it does, at least a game should say something when a good guess
  is made.  (Trying to cross the volcano on the magic carpet in
  &quot;Spellbreaker&quot; is a case in point.)
</p>

<p>
  One reason why &quot;Zork&quot; held the player's attention so
  firmly (and why it took about ten times the code size, despite being
  slightly smaller than the original mainframe Adventure) was that it
  had a huge stock of usually funny responses to reasonable things
  which might be tried.
</p>

<p>
  My favourite funny response, which I can't resist reprinting here, is:
</p>
<pre>

   Down seems more likely.     <i>&quot;Spellbreaker&quot;</i>
</pre>
<p>
  (Though I also recommend trying to take the sea serpent in
  &quot;Zork II&quot;.)  This is a good example because it's exactly
  the sort of boring rule (can't move from the midair position) which
  most designers usually want to code as fast as possible, and don't
  write with any imagination.
</p>

<p>
  Just as some puzzles should have more than one solution, some
  objects should have more than one purpose.  In bad old games,
  players automatically threw away everything as soon as they'd used
  them.  In better designed games, obviously useful things (like the
  crowbar and the gloves in &quot;Lurking Horror&quot;) should be hung
  on to by the player throughout.
</p>

<h3>8.  The Map </h3>

<p>
  To maintain an atmosphere throughout it's vital that the map should
  be continuous.  Adventure games used to have maps like
</p>
<pre>
            Glacier
               |
          Oriental Room  --  Fire Station
           (megaphone)        (pot plant)
               |
           Cheese Room
</pre>
<p>
  in which the rooms bore no relation to each other, so that the game
  had no overall geography at all, and objects were unrelated to the
  rooms they were in.  Much more believable is something like
</p>
<pre>
       Snowy Mountainside
                \  
             Carved Tunnel
                   |
             Oriental Room  -- Jade Passage -- Fire Dragon
                (buddha)       (bonsai tree)      Room
                   |
             Blossom Room
</pre>
<p>
  Try to have some large-scale geography too: the mountainside should
  extend across the map in both directions.  If there is a stream
  passing through a given location, what happens to it?  And so on.
</p>

<p>
  In designing a map, it adds to the interest to make a few
  connections in the rarer compass directions (NE, NW, SE, SW) to
  prevent the player from a feeling that the game has a square grid.
  Also, it's nice to have a few (possibly long) loops which can be
  walked around, to prevent endless retracing of steps.
</p>

<p>
  If the map is very large, or if a good deal of to-and-froing is
  called for, there should be some rapid means of moving across it,
  such as the magic words in Adventure, or the cubes in
  &quot;Spellbreaker&quot;.
</p>

<p><i> Macbeth: This is VERY important in a MUD. Try to maintain
  consistency.</i> </p>

<h3>9.  The End Game </h3>

<p>
  Some end games are small (&quot;Lurking Horror&quot;, or
  &quot;Sorcerer&quot; for instance), others large (the master game of
  the mainframe Adventure).  Nonetheless almost all games have one.
</p>

<p>
  End games serve two purposes.  Firstly they give the player a sense
  of being near to success, and can be used to culminate the plot, to
  reveal the game's secrets.  This is obvious enough.  But secondly
  they also serve to stop the final stage of the game from being too
  hard.
</p>

<p>
  As a designer, you don't usually want the last step to be too
  difficult; you want to give the player the satisfaction of
  finishing, as a reward for having got through the game.  (But of
  course you want to make him work for it.)  An end game helps,
  because it narrows the game, so that only a few rooms and objects
  are accessible.
</p>

<p>
  The most annoying thing is requiring the player to have brought a
  few otherwise useless objects with him.  The player should not be
  thinking that the reason for being stuck on the master game is that
  something very obscure should have been done 500 turns before.
</p>

<h3>10.  And Finally... </h3>

<p>
  Finally, the winner gets some last message (which, like the opening
  message, should have something amusing in it and should not be too
  long).  That needn't quite be all, though.  In its final
  incarnations (alas, not the one included in Lost Treasures),
  &quot;Zork I&quot; offered winners access to the hints system at the
  RESTART, RESTORE or QUIT prompt.
</p>

<p><i>Macbeth: Of course, this is quite different in TubMud. You'll
  have to arrange for a quest reward and guide the player back to a
  place which has a connection to the rest of the MUD. There may even
  be more than just a message - use your imagination. In general, a
  good quest doesn't even need to deal out a huge amount of rewards -
  playing it will have been enough of a reward.</i></p>

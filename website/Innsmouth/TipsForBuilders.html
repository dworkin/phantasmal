    <h3 style="text-align: center"> General Tips for MUD Builders </h3>

    <p>
      Most of these are inspired by TopMUDSites.com, from a thread
      on their Builder board.  Massive props especially to Sanvean
      of Armageddon MUD and Estarra.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Plan your area first, and pay attention to how it would
        'really' work.  If your area is a fortress, an inn, a kitchen
        or a stretch of wolf-ridden woods, think about what such an
        area should have in it, and how it should be laid out. </li>
      <li> Make your NPCs vibrant.  There should be at least two or
        three different actions and reactions available (such as
        emotes, things they say, or stimuli they react to) that are
        specific to that NPC. </li>
      <li> Details, details, details </li>
      <li> Use all five senses, and (sparingly) impressions like
        'foreboding'.  On impressions, Estarra says: <i>For example,
        you walk into a sacrificial pit for a dark god and read as
        part of the description &quot;Despair and fear vibrate in
        the air.&quot;</i> [...] <i>Or even: &quot;The statue of the ancient
        god makes even the most hardened heart flutter at the
        majesty.&quot; (Note: I don't mean things like &quot;You
        walk into the room and feel fear.&quot; I never use the
        first person.)</i> </li>
      <li> Use active, dynamic verbs rather than passive verbs </li>
      <li> Use the present tense, unless you have a very good reason
        not to. </li>
      <li> Use good grammar and spelling.  Make sure to use complete
        sentences, not fragments or run-ons. </li>
      <li> Don't put two spaces between sentences.  It looks fine in
        office correspondence but it adapts poorly to MUDs. </li>
      <li> Don't let your editor help you.  Microsoft Word and some
        other editors will automatically format for you, add bullets
        and superscripts and whatnot.  Turn this feature off. </li>
      <li> From Estarra, verbatim:

        <p>
          Don't use &quot;seems to&quot; or &quot;looks like&quot;
          or &quot;appears to be&quot;.
          This is a common mistake that strikes even the very best
          and experienced builder. Feel free to use metaphors and
          simile, but using the phrases &quot;seems&quot;,
          &quot;looks like&quot;, and
          &quot;appears to be&quot; weakens the impact. If the man
          appears to be the oldest man in the village, then chances
          are the man <i>is</i> the oldest man in the village.
          Ninety-nine percent of the time, it can be avoided.
          For example,
        </p>

        <p><b>Weak</b></p>

        <p>This troll appears to be the largest of its kind. Its skin
          seems to be an almost
          phosphorescent green and its large fangs look like it could
          tear through not
          only skin but bone. </p>

        <p><b>Dynamic</b></p>

        <p>The troll is enormous, the largest of its kind. Its skin
          glows an almost
          phosphorescent green and its large fangs could tear through
          not only skin
          but bone.</p>
      </li>
      <li> Don't reference the player in the room.  Don't tell him what
        s/he thinks, what s/he feels, or where s/he just came from.
        Don't tell the player their opinion.  Avoid the words &quot;you&quot;,
        &quot;your&quot; and so on.  Describe the room and
        the impact will be greater, especially if the player doesn't
        feel the way you claim.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't describe important objects or mobiles in the room.  What
        if they aren't there any more?  Create this objects or mobiles
        and let them describe themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where possible, avoid referencing history in the room descriptions.
        Unless you know the player is aware of a particular conflict,
        political group or similar (and leaving readable scrolls describing
        it does <i>not</i> mean the player knows, or remembers, or
        associates the scroll with the current room!), don't mention that
        group or event.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask your coders for things.  If you have a vision of how something
        could be done with a small new feature, suggest it.  The worst
        that will happen is that they'll say 'no'.  If they have
        countersuggestions for different ways to do the same thing,
        listen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use multiple aliases.  Make sure that the old witch can be
        a witch, a woman, an old witch, an old woman, an evil witch,
        and so on.  Your codebase may be able to help you with
        this for gender, class, race and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personalization and uniqueness -- items 'skinned' from mobiles,
        equipment that changes condition, etc add a lot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sanvean suggests weather changes, travel, and equipment
        that changes status because of it -- gets wet, bloody, rusty,
        sweaty, dusty, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have your zones/sectors affect the feel of things.  Change
        travel messages, messages from spells, etc.  If possible,
        be able to forage for various things in different sectors
        (water, food, rocks, sticks, salt, etc).
      </li>
      <li>
        Tattoos and scars that can be acquired in play, and that can
        be set on NPCs as well.

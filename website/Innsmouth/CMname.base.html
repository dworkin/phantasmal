    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Naming Policies (from CthulhuMUD) </h2>

    <h3> (Not necessarily applicable on Innsmouth, but still good
       guidelines) </h3>

    <p>
      With the approval system, once again there has been debate on
      what makes
      a good name or not. So, from the top... 
    </p>

    <p>
      A bad name may be caught at the approval stage by a hero or
      immortal.  At this point you can disapprove a character and
      suggest a new name by
      this command: disapprove Remember, any name disapproved in this
      fashion
      is automatically added to a disapprove list for automatic
      disapproval. So,
      if you don't really mean it... don't do it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Names may not be well-known fictional names, obscene, offensive, or
      'hot topic'.
    </p>

    <p>
Bad names include names from popular television shows, books, or movies.
One way to tell the bad names from good are, if you recognize it, and it
is not an actual name in the real world, it should probably be dropped.
Xavier for instance, despite it's X-Men background was a perfectly valid
name before the comics, as is Bobby, Jean, Scott, and Peter. In addition,
the more obscure the reference the more tolerable it is. If it's obscurity
is so great that it would truly take a fan of the work to recognize it, the
name is tolerable, just so long as the character's title does not make the
reference clearer. For instance, 'Bottom the Adventurer', is fine, 'Bottom
the clown of Midsummer's Night Dream' is not. (To see why Bottom is
acceptable, read further down.) 
   </p>

   <p>
Examples of obvious bad names are: Buffy, Macgyver, Clinton, any Sailor
Moon character, any Dragonball Z character, Lestat, Raistlin, and other
such names*. 
   </p>

   <p>
Bad names of an obscene nature include English curse words, as well as
any other curse words in languages that you recognize. Also included in
this are references to sexual acts. 
   </p>

   <p>
Examples include: (Take a guess which one of these has actually appeared
on the mud before.) Cunt, Bitch, Fuck (and any derivative), and other such
phrases. Punta, and other offensive non-English words should be pulled as
well. After all, we've confirmed we have a rather wide variety of language
speakers on the mud. Sodomite, Cungellius, and other such are included as
well. 
   </p>

   <p>
Offensive names are names that are designed to insult, spam, or are
otherwise just flat out unacceptable. These are the painful names that
deserve to be slapped down. 
   </p>

   <p>
Examples include: KaneSucks, KaneBlows, LoSeRsCrIpTkIdDiE, 2BIG2Handle,
MrRight etc. 
   </p>

   <p>
'Hot Topic' names are names that, while not necessarily well-known,
obscene or offensive, are likely to set off some buttons. These are harder
to determine sometimes. 
   </p>

   <p>
Examples include: YawehFuer. An explanation, Yahweh is a Kabalistic
(Jewish mysticism) reference to God. Fuer is commonly recognized as a
title for Hitler. The problem should be quite clear from that. Other
various names and title combinations, 'O'Paddy the Irish Bomber' and the
such should also be understandably bad. A hot topic is pretty much any
situation that people have killed each other over, or attempted to do
so. It does take a certain sick creativity to come up with these names,
but they do occur. 
   </p>

   <p>
* The policy is not applied retroactively. Please discourage titles
combined with names that make references far too obvious. 
   </p>

   <p>
Good names are names that this policy doesn't cover. It doesn't matter
if the name matches the RP level of the character type, or how much you
like the name, how they got the name is their own business. Dave the Migo
is acceptable. (Two easy ways to have gotten this name in RP: a false
identity, really sick parents) Also acceptable is ShadowDragon, Bastlynn,
Hugo, or other such names. If a name is stupid but not 'bad', then the
players themselves will laugh it off and the player who made the mistake
of selecting that name in the first place will eventually change names
under group pressure. Or they won't and will likely be ignored. (Hence,
Bottom is acceptable.) The name policy is designed to pull names that
are over the line of taste, not style. 
   </p>

   <p>
Getting a name changed past the approval stage is a bit harder. If you
have the rename command, no problem, go ahead and rename the character.
Ask what name they would like to have. If they try to say no, feel free
to point out that you *do* help run the place and have been told by higher
ups that you can discipline players who don't give you the least bit of
respect. (Of course, don't abuse this power!) If the argument lasts more
than five or ten minutes or is reduced to, and I quote from experience:
"I like my name." "Hugo likes me. So my name's ok." and
'goss "Help! I'm trapped with Bast and she won't let me go!"', then you
have every right to be annoyed. In that case, scribble a note about it on
the immboard and senior staff with the force delete command will handle it. 
   </p>

   <p>
If you don't have the rename command, you can still suggest a rename and
find out what they would like to have. At that point, leave a note on
immboard and the next person who has the rename command will get it done. 
   </p>

   <p>
Also keep in mind: One rename per customer. They don't get a second one...
so make the first one count. Renames are NOT available to players whose
names are already acceptable. They should have picked the name they wanted
to begin with. And in addition someone should not try to escape a
'reputation' they built under a name but get to keep the character.

      Game Design for an Unnamed Game of Light and Darkness </h3>

    <p>
      The one-line summary:  Light contends with Darkness in a bid
      for the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Individual creatures are good or evil, and make their way in
      the world as such.  Their behavior will tilt their power toward
      light or darkness.  Eventually, they can become a champion of
      a faction of good or evil.
    </p>

    <p>
      Players and NPCs are fairly mobile, and escape and travel are
      pretty easy.  It's not hard to slip through enemy lines, nor
      to escape from a battle when it's not going your way.  This is
      similar to a standard MUD.  Light and dark each have safe areas
      that are, y'know, pretty safe, though not absolutely 100% safe,
      but most areas are disputed.  Disputed areas may lean to one
      side or the other, and usually do.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a character is a champion of a particular faction, he gains
      the ability to use the equipment specific to that faction.  A
      faction may have shrines, seige machinery and followers.  While
      the player is personally pretty mobile and may move and escape
      very freely, the faction's equipment and followers move slowly,
      and are probably visible at a significant distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shrines are visible at a significant distance, and move slowly.
      Some characters or followers may be able to detect them at an
      even greater distance.  Shrines are expressions of good or evil,
      and will change the balance of the land toward good or evil.
      The more powerful the shrine, the more slowly it moves, and the
      greater its influence.  Shrines are vulnerable - powerful
      characters may defile them, reducing their power and influence.
      A shrine in a friendly area will tend to 'charge up' and become
      more powerful, while one in an enemy area will tend to discharge
      some of its power while slowly making the land lighter or darker.
    </p>

    <p>
      Characters are a sort of 'special forces' - excellent for
      infiltrating enemy areas and performing missions of stealth,
      subtlety or cleverness.  However, great military victories will
      require greater power than an individual player character can
      reasonably have.  Followers will be either numerous or very
      powerful, or both.  They move more slowly, and can be destroyed
      by combat with enemy followers, or by travel through hostile
      lands.  Different followers may have different abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Player characters should be easily able to escape enemy followers
      unless severely outnumbered or otherwise pinned down.  However,
      destroying enemy followers should be quite difficult except by
      using followers of one's own, or if the followers are in
      severely hostile territory - light followers in dark territory
      or vice-versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      If territory is disputed, but tilted slightly toward light or
      dark, battles will tend to cost the oppressed side more deaths
      than otherwise.  If the territory is severely tilted toward light
      or dark, oppressed forces will lose *far* more followers in
      every battle.  Travellers passing through severe opposing
      territory will occasionally be weakened or destroyed.  This will
      hinder followers very severely, since they are slow.  It will
      hinder characters, but not nearly as much as followers.

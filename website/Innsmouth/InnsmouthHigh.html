    <p>
      This belongs in the 'bad idea' file, but it won't let me stop
      thinking about it, so I'm writing it down.
    </p>

    <p>
      The one-line summary: you're a highschool student in a town
      captured by horrors, fighting bullies and evil while keeping
      your grades up.
    </p>

    <p>
      One primary concern is combat: non-lethal in almost all cases.
      Only grown-ups (NPCs only, early on) can initiate lethal combat.
      However, wounds like noogies and indian burn take time to fade,
      and you won't attack whoever gave them to you until they do.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could be a tough guy, a skinny geek, an outsider, or from
      the wrong side of the tracks...  You'd choose where your family
      lived during character creation, and a bit about yourself.
      Orphans would live in Saint Christopher's Mission with the
      priest there.  They'd have very low social status, but probably
      be damn good at sneaking stuff past the teachers :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      Fighting horrors is something that academics did in Lovecraft
      stories for a reason -- people expect them to be eccentric, they
      have a lot of free time and a relatively loose schedule.  This
      is true of high school students as well.  To further increase
      the Lovecraftian atmosphere, book-learning makes you uncool --
      therefore, few high-schoolers can learn to anything like
      professorial levels the arcane and occult chants necessary to
      cast spells.  This keeps IH from having any significant number
      of mages, avoiding the explosion of casual magic-use that
      CthulhuMUD suffers from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cultists could initiate lethal combat, but usually wouldn't
      against kids -- it's bad form, and the kids aren't perceived as
      much of a threat.  More often they'd bind and gag them, then
      remove all evidence (including memories?) and dump them
      somewhere with a dire warning.  Another option would be to drive
      them temporarily insane and dump them, so that their story
      wouldn't be creditable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of sanity -- kids are both less rigid (mostly) and more
      resilient than adults, so sanity losses wouldn't be as earth
      shaking, and would come back more easily.  Of course, regaining
      sanity might cost memory, along with skill points gained that
      way...
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, after enough experience as a kid, a character could
      'grow up'.  Early on, that would mean character retirement.
      Later it would mean a remort character, one that wasn't welcome
      in the high school, but could fight horrors more directly, more
      powerfully, and with more chance of actually dying.

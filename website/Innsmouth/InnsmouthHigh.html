    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Game Design for 'Innsmouth High' </h3>

    <p>
      This belongs in the 'bad idea' file, but it won't let me stop
      thinking about it, so I'm writing it down.
    </p>

    <p>
      The one-line summary: you're a highschool student in a town
      captured by horrors, fighting bullies and evil while keeping
      your grades up.
    </p>

    <p>
      One primary concern is combat: non-lethal in almost all cases.
      Only grown-ups (NPCs only, early on) can initiate lethal combat.
      However, wounds like noogies and indian burn take time to fade,
      and you won't attack whoever gave them to you until they do.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could be a tough guy, a skinny geek, an outsider, or from
      the wrong side of the tracks...  You'd choose where your family
      lived during character creation, and a bit about yourself.
      Orphans would live in Saint Christopher's Mission with the
      priest there.  They'd have very low social status, but probably
      be damn good at sneaking stuff past the teachers :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      There'd have to be 'bad kids', a gang led by somebody with the
      last name Marsh and with a couple of Gilmans thrown in for good
      measure.  You know they'd have to be dastardly, obviously mean,
      even from a distance, and some of the teachers would have to
      love them.  Think Malfoy and Snape, or any smooth-talking school
      bully in your own history.  This would provide a more normal set
      of day-to-day opponents without having to leave the school, and
      opponents who would side with the cultists and horrors to do a
      little of their in-school dirty work.  But these bullies can't
      initiate lethal combat, have to stay within the watchful eyes of
      the teachers, and are just generally kid-sized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day-to-day opposition wouldn't always be the same gang of
      bullies (some of whom might be players!).  That could get
      boring.  But remember that teachers, janitors and the principal
      all provide regular opposition.  Classes provide quests (keep
      those grades up!  Make a diorama!  Collect fifteen different
      kinds of bugs for Science class!).  It'd be nice to have really
      cartoon-style quests, things like joining a clique or meeting
      the new kid or things like that, but I'm not sure how well it
      would work.  Most of it requires heavy NPC participation.  I'm
      sure some of that could be done as player TinyPlot sorta things,
      but that requires setting the right atmosphere so that people
      are cliquish and kinda petty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cliquish is easy.  Provide in-character societies with different
      benefits.  The bad boys gang, the social in-crowd, children of
      Irish or Polish immigrants, the outcasts whose parents are
      originally from another town...  Make sure the groups have their
      own chat channels, their own identifying insignia, their own
      advantages and disadvantages, and that adults treat them
      differently.  Keep track of various deeds and competitions
      between them.  Voila!  Players will ostracize each other,
      compete with each other, and generally keep the groups as
      separate, clannish, infighting little units.  Just like high
      school, and for many of the same reasons.  For extra brownie
      points, they should be paranoid of each other with constant
      rumors of nasty plans and lots of tattling on each other to the
      teachers.  An unduly-strict player justice system (i.e. see a
      crime, report it to the teacher, player gets punished) will do
      this nicely.  Again, just like high school, and again, for
      exactly the same reasons.  To keep people from absolutely hating
      the game, members of a particular social group should disapprove
      highly of tattling on people in your *own* group.  There should
      be serious penalties.  'Cause otherwise nobody would want to be
      in an NPC-supported group, it'd be too dangerous with too few
      benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fighting horrors is something that academics did in Lovecraft
      stories for a reason -- people expect them to be eccentric, they
      have a lot of free time and a relatively loose schedule.  This
      is true of high school students as well.  To further increase
      the Lovecraftian atmosphere, book-learning makes you uncool --
      therefore, few high-schoolers can learn to anything like
      professorial levels the arcane and occult chants necessary to
      cast spells.  This keeps IH from having any significant number
      of mages, avoiding the explosion of casual magic-use that
      CthulhuMUD suffers from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cultists could initiate lethal combat, but usually wouldn't
      against kids -- it's bad form, and the kids aren't perceived as
      much of a threat.  More often they'd bind and gag them, then
      remove all evidence (including memories?) and dump them
      somewhere with a dire warning.  Another option would be to drive
      them temporarily insane and dump them, so that their story
      wouldn't be creditable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Speaking of sanity -- kids are both less rigid (mostly) and more
      resilient than adults, so sanity losses wouldn't be as earth
      shaking, and would come back more easily.  Of course, regaining
      sanity might cost memory, along with skill points gained that
      way...
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, after enough experience as a kid, a character could
      'grow up'.  Early on, that would mean character retirement.
      Later it would mean a remort character, one that wasn't welcome
      in the high school, but could fight horrors more directly, more
      powerfully, and with more chance of actually dying.

  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Verbs for Mobile Actions </h3>

  <p>
    For each <a href="MobAction.html">Mobile Action</a> that is to be
    executed, there must be an action structure, which encapsulates
    the basic action, and a set of parameters of that action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every action has an actor - that is, it is performed <i>by</i> some
    mobile.  It may have one or more direct objects which can be mobiles
    or non-sentient objects.  For instance, the &quot;take&quot; action
    will operate on a single object (which may be sentient or not).
    Movement actions (&quot;move north&quot;) will have a direction as an
    argument.  Communication actions will have what to communicate, and
    possibly who to communicate it to.
  </p>

  <p>
    A given mobile is permitted to override any verb it is to perform.
    That is, a &quot;black bear&quot; mobile type may override the movement
    operation to leave bear footprints, or to growl periodically, or whatever
    is deemed appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    A mobile can perceive when another mobile near it is about to perform
    an action.  Phantasmal permits the mobile to notice the pending action
    and prevent it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Different actions will notify different locations when they are pending.
    For instance, a movement action will notify the location from which the
    mobile is moving, and the new location <i>to</i> which it is moving.
    A mobile in either location can prevent the movement if it wishes.  A
    communication action will notify the room from which the communication
    is occurring, and possibly also a wider area in some cases.  In every
    case, the room where the mobile is taking action will be notified.
  </p>

  <p> Example: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Mobile A sends out notification of pending action Move(north) to room MyRoom</li>
    <li>Mobile B is in MyRoom, and receives notification that A is about to move north</li>
    <li>Mobile B is blocking the north exit, and returns a value to Phantasmal indicating
        that the action is not permitted, and should be cancelled.</li>
    <li>Mobile A is told that his action has been prevented by Mobile B.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For a specific action to occur, there are several notifications that go out.  The
    first notification tells nearby actors that the action is preparing to take place,
    and gives them a chance to prevent it.  The second notification indicates that the
    action will take place, and may not be cancelled.  The third notification is to
    indicate that the action has successfully completed.  In each case, the action
    structure will be sent out with the notification.
  </p>

  <p>
    It may be useful to have a specific Phantasmal-based game be able to categorize
    'subscriptions' to these events, since the game will potentially alter what verbs
    notify what areas, and may have particular kinds of events that are never subscribed
    to, or otherwise highly optimizable.  That is beyond the current scope of this
    document.

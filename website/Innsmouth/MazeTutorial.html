    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Molly O'Hara's Maze Tutorial </h3>

    <p>
      Molly O'Hara of 4Dimensions.org posted this maze tutorial to
      a board on TopMUDSites.com.  I'm reposting it here because
      hey, it's good.
    </p>

<p>
  Here's something simple for all codebases. MAZES. Most players hate
  them, but we all use them, to add some space between other zones,
  and also to torment them a bit. But not all new Builders know how to
  make a Maze right, so here is a crash course:
</p>

<p>
  Basically there are two types of mazes, linear or grids,
  representing the winding tunnels in a Dungeon or a seemingly endless
  prairie or forest. Mostly they are created in the same simple way,
  by linking the rooms back in circles, and here.s where inexperienced
  Builders quite often go wrong.
</p>

<p>
  Linking in circles is fine, unless you do it on a straight line with
  too short distance between the back-linked rooms. The minimum
  distance is the number of rooms you can see other chars in, when
  looking in a direction. Otherwise you are going to see yourself, and
  that immediately gives the trick away. So the smallest functional
  maze you can make is 4 rooms, linked in a square, like this
</p>

<pre>
ab
cd
</pre>

<p>
  To make a maze out of this you just need to link a to d both north
  and west, and then link the three other rooms after the same
  principle. Even a mini maze like this can keep some players running
  around in circles for ages, but of course the more rooms you use,
  the harder it gets. And the room descs don.t HAVE to be all similar
  either, even though that.s the most common. A maze can be just as
  confusing - and a lot more interesting - with individual descs.
</p>

<p>
  We have a 100 room desert, that is a grid maze, where the rooms are
  all individual. The desert has a definite topography with ridges,
  depressions and a couple of waterholes, and because of the circle
  linking it gets repetitive in a certain rhythm, but basically you
  can wander around there forever. The desert code makes it a nasty
  place, where you mostly need to find some shadow during daytime, and
  move only at night. And it has had several players begging to be let
  out, because the exit is quite hard to find, and we made the entire
  zone !recall, !teleport and !summon-out too.
</p>

<p>
  The exit from a maze is of course the funny thing to make. It can be
  something as simple as a closed or hidden door, but it can also be
  something subtler, like an invisible portal or some mob letting you
  out in return for a favour. Or it can be a nasty trick. Below is an
  example of the latter. (This maze is in our Mud School, so I am not
  giving any big secrets away).
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  Before they enter the Maze, the player gets the following
  information: <br /> When you go east from this room, you'll enter a
  maze. It is not very large, but it can still be pretty
  confusing. The rooms look all the same, so it will be a bit hard to
  figure out where you are. The Quest is simply to find the way out of
  the maze. Apart from the obvious solution of just going DOWN to
  Recall and dropping out, of course. *snicker*.
</p>

<p>
  The maze itself is only 6 rooms, linked after the principle in the
  example above, and each room looks like this:
</p>

<p>
  In A Large Forest [ Exits: n e s w d ] <br /> The forest is large,
  the trees tower above your head. Very little light penetrates
  through the dense foliage, not even in the middle of the
  day. Although there is no undergrowth blocking the view, this forest
  is still confusing, since every direction looks the same. The ground
  is covered with sparse grass, and there are several rabbit holes
  here, so watch your step. Occasionally you catch a glimpse of one of
  these cotton-tails, scampering away at the sound of your footsteps.
</p>

<p>
  You can go in all cardinal directions in all rooms. Looking in any
  direction gives the same info: All directions look the same in this
  forest..
</p>

<p>
  Looking up, only shows the sky above, so that is no option. Climbing
  the trees doesn.t work either.  Looking down gives this info: .A
  small rabbit hole leads down.. And also shows up the usual lazy
  crowd of players squatting at Recall.
</p>

<p>
  There are no hidden doors or portals anywhere. So how do you get out?
</p>

<p>
  Easy. You go down. 
</p>

<p>
  One of the six rooms is different, the exit down leads to an extra
  room, which in turns leads down to Recall. The attentive player
  would notice this because of the message about the players down
  there. Instead of .You see Soandso immediately to the down., in one
  of the rooms it will say .close by to the down. instead.
</p>

<p>
  But since this Maze is in the Mud School, we want to teach the new
  players to use the not-so-common options LISTEN and SMELL, and
  therefor we put the main clue there. So in 5 of the rooms you get
  the Listen message .You hear the wind in the crowns of the
  trees. while in the room with the exit you get .A rustling sound is
  coming from the rabbit hole below. Wow, that hole is really
  uncommonly big!.
</p>

<p>
That's one if the things you can use the extra descs for.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
  On a side note: <br /> There are some coded or scripted ways to make
  mazes too, and at least one of them is downloadable from the
  net. Exits get opened and shut randomly as the zone resets, so it.s
  never quite the same. But I really don.t like those options
  myself. To me it makes sense that once you have mapped a maze, you
  should be able to follow the same path next time you enter it. We do
  have one Maze however, which is scripted to give an individual path
  for each player who makes it through. For each individual player the
  path is always the same, but no two players get the same route. This
  was made to stop the blabbering among some players who told each
  other the directions, and was of course very effective. But it also
  took a pretty long and complicated script to set it up, and even
  though I am fond of scripts, I prefer things to be simple.

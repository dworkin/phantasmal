  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Coding Phantasmal Mobiles </h3>

  <p>
    Code for mobiles in Phantasmal should obey some basic guidelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal has a <a href="Verbs.html">process to allow mobiles to prevent
    other mobiles from taking actions</a>.  Make sure your action plays nice
    with this process.  Make sure your action is appropriately preventable
    and doesn't try to get around the usual process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just as your mobile's actions should be preventable with the normal
    Phantasmal prevention process (which has priority over it), it should also
    play nice with the processes that are lower-priority.  Make sure that your
    action can be prevented on certain objects, mobiles or locations so that
    if somebody wants to override your action for plot reasons, that can be
    done.  Tags can be a great way to do this.

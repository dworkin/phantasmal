    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Persistence in MUDs </h3>

    <p>
      These are poorly-organized thoughts about persistence in MUDs,
      and various issues related to it.
    </p>

    <h3> Time in MUDs, and Continuity </h3>

    <p>
      In-MUD time has a conversion factor associated with it -- that
      is, it's a multiple of real-world wall-clock time.  How long a
      real-world day is in the MUD (and vice-versa) depends on that
      conversion.  This leads to a whole host of realism problems
      related to things like travel time and reaction time, but we're
      going to ignore all those for now as not being related to
      persistence.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a problem that <i>does</i> have to do with
      persistence...  When the MUD goes down for awhile there'll be a
      jump in real-world time.  This includes scheduled maintenance,
      not just crashes.  The question is how the MUD should address
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some ways we could deal with the programmatic interface:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
	  Keep going forward, running all the scripts and triggers,
	  until we catch up.  That could be *really* slow on startup,
	  and there are questions of safety and things if players are
	  logged in at the time, or if their bodies or possessions are
	  vulnerable.  A lot of time can go by all at once...
	</li>
	<li>
	  Cancel all the call_outs, but make some way to subscribe
          for a notification when the time skips to reschedule
          them.  That requires a lot of code on the part of
          anybody that reschedules.  But for events that should just
	  happen every so often, but we don't care about their
	  cumulative effects, it works great.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Keep going like nothing happened -- this would require
          any events that really cared about real-world time to
          check the time for themselves.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Have some notifications that run at specific times relative
          to the real world, and others that just run
          &quot;periodically&quot; -- the period ones would keep
          ticking away across statedumps, skipping all the ones from
          the MUD's lost time.  The real-world ones would be delivered
          at the right times, but any that would have happened when
          the MUD was down would all happen at once right after it
          came back up, probably passing a &quot;late&quot; flag to
          say that they hadn't happened at the correct real-world
          time.  This is a hybrid between the first approach and the
          second one.

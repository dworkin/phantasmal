  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Continuous and Combinable Events in a
    Text-Based Environment </h3>

  <h2> What Types of Events Are There? </h2>

  <p>
    'Events', in this context, indicate perceptible things that
    happen.  If a character's stomach growls, or a gnat begins to fly
    to the west, or the earth rumbles, that may be an event.
  </p>

  <h3> Instant and Timed Events </h3>

  <p>
    Many events will be <em>instant</em>.  That is to say, they will
    take place at a very specific, well-defined moment in time.  While
    their effects may continue for longer, the event will occur and be
    perceived very specifically at that moment.  For instance, the
    firing of a cannon could easily be represented as an
    <em>instant</em> event.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some events take place over a period of time.  They generally
    (though not always) have a set, specific beginning and a set,
    specific end.  Unlike <em>instant</em> events, these
    <em>timed</em> events can be occurring for a particular interval.
    If one checks periodically (perhaps with a &quot;look&quot; or
    &quot;listen&quot; command) one can perceive some set of timed
    events that are currently in progress.  One could thus consider
    descriptions of characters and objects to be special cases of
    timed events.  However, instant events are normally perceived only
    once (if at all), at the specific moment when they actually occur.
  </p>

  <h3> The Five Senses </h3>

  <p>
    Something that is conceptually a single event, such as a cannon
    firing, often consists of perceptible phenomena in more than one
    sense.  For instance, the cannon's firing will include a loud
    (audible) report, but also a (visible) flash from the powder, a
    (tactile) vibration through the earth, and perhaps even a
    (smellable, tastable) tang in the air from the explosion.  Then,
    timed events may follow as the smoke slowly rises and disperses.
  </p>

  <h3> Composite Events </h3>

  <p>
    As the preceding example shows, it can be difficult to distinguish
    individual events from each other.  For narrative purposes, a
    barrage of cannonfire may act as a single event, but it may be
    broken down into multiple.  This is especially important when
    different senses may be affected differently - a cannon barrage
    may be felt and heard but not seen if a wall is in between, or if
    it takes place on a dark night.  They may be felt and seen but not
    heard by a deaf cannoneer!  These sub-events may be noticed
    separately from each other, and so should be separable, at least
    in some cases.
  </p>

  <h3> Levels of Perception and Perceptibility </h3>

  <p>
    Some events, like an earthquake, are so important, powerful and
    perceptible that it is almost inconceivable that one could be
    nearby and not notice them.  Some, such as a gnat shifting
    position, are so nearly imperceptible that one would have to be in
    precisely the right location and have very good powers of
    perception to have a chance of noticing.
  </p>

  <p>
    An event's <em>perceptibility</em> is how noticeable it is.  An
    earthquake, a cannon's firing and the roar of a waterfall all have
    a high <em>perceptibility</em>.  A small motion like a gnat's
    flight, or a quiet sound, will have a low <em>perceptibility</em>.
    <em>Perceptibility</em> may behave differently for different
    senses.  It will usually attenuate with distance.  It may be
    affected by other factors like background noise or how light or
    dark an area is.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Perception</em> is measured against <em>perceptibility</em>,
    and on the same scale.  Somebody's <em>perception</em> indicates
    how good they are at the indicated form of awareness (sight,
    sound, smell, etc), and how much attention they are currently
    paying.  For instance, being in combat will normally lower one's
    effective <em>perception</em>, as will specifically concentrating
    on some other sense or location than the one being checked.
  </p>

  <h3> Variably-Perceived Events </h3>

  <p>
    Some events may have multiple descriptions, depending on how
    perceptible they are, how close to the event one is, and other
    factors.  For instance, the cannon's firing may be deafening up
    close, but distant or echoing if you're farther away.  A character
    with a lot of knowledge or very good eyesight may discover
    different things on an ancient vase than a less knowledgeable or
    less perceptive character.  The same factors that reduce
    perception (distance, light, background noise) will tend to have
    variable descriptions associated with them.  In addition, many
    other game specific factors (season, knowledge skills, character
    class) may potentially have an effect.
  </p>

  <h4> Virtual Events </h4>

  <p>
    In some cases, a repeatable description may change, with or
    without notifying the player (or character).  For instance, if a
    Paladin is able to detect evil, his description of a scene may
    include a phrase like &quot;Morford the Silly is here.  A green
    aura of neutrality surrounds him.&quot; If Morford proceeds to
    perform some incredibly virtuous action and the Paladin looks
    around again, he may see &quot;Morford the Silly is here.  A white
    aura of beatific goodness surrounds him.&quot;
  </p>

  <p>
    An advanced game may remark on the difference along with Morford's
    action: &quot;Morford restores a lollipop to its rightful owner, a
    virtuous street urchin.  Morford now glows with a white aura of
    beatific goodness!&quot; However, in a less advanced engine, the
    description will change but the player will not be notified.  If
    the player wishes to see Morford's new status, he or she will need
    to look around again.  We refer to this as a <em>virtual</em>
    event.  Conceptually it is an event, but it has no direct
    representation in the game engine.
  </p>

  <h2> A Structure for In-Game Events </h2>

  <h3> Instant Events </h3>

  <p>
    A given <em>instant</em> event will need to exist in one or more
    specific senses, or be explicitly declared to be in multiple.  It
    must be possible for it to be a <em>composite</em> event.  For
    each sense in which the event exists, there must be a
    perceptibility threshold (the perception is a function of the
    player, and attenuating the perception or perceptibility is done
    by the game engine).  So, a given <em>instant</em> event's event
    structure will consist of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Text description (an ASCII string or other text description) </li>
    <li>Perceptibility (an integer, generally) </li>
    <li>What sense (an enumeration) </li>
    <li>Sub-events (a list of event structures) </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If an event consists of sub-events, it is assumed that those
    sub-events are, collectively, equal to the event itself.  That is,
    if the text of the event itself is shown, then the player should
    be getting the equivalent of all the sub-events.  Similarly, if
    every sub-event can be perceived, the game engine should be
    willing and able to show the top event as a summary of all
    sub-events together.
  </p>

  <p>
    The event will be labelled with a sense.  Those senses will
    probably include the ordinary five, but may also include fantasy
    senses like ESP and nonstandard sense descriptions like
    &quot;temperature&quot; for game reasons.  For instance,
    temperature will propagate differently over distance than
    vibration, and direct touch won't propagate over distance at all -
    but all three of these are usually lumped together into the sense
    of touch.  The game engine will need to know which of these things
    an event is to know what to do with it.  In addition, the event
    may be labelled as being no sense at all.  In that case, the event
    will be displayed if and only if all of its sub-events can be
    perceived.  In other words, it is as though the perceptibility
    threshold was set to be entirely imperceptible - see the paragraph
    about an event being equivalant to its sub-events for why these
    two things behave identically.
  </p>

  <h3> Timed Events </h3>

  <p>
    Timed events, those that have duration, build on the structure of
    instant events.  A timed event may have optional instant events
    for their beginning and ending.  For instance, if a metronome
    begins ticking, the starting event may say, &quot;the metronome
    begins its monotonous clacking&quot;, the timed event may say
    &quot;the metronome is ticking&quot;, and the ending event may say
    &quot;the metronome halts its ticking and is silent&quot;.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike the beginning and ending events, the timed event is
    perceptible for a noticeable amount of time.  A player might type
    &quot;listen&quot; and receive the message about the metronome
    during an hour or more when it has begun but not yet ended.
  </p>

  <p>
    A timed event structure will include everything that the instant
    event structure does.  If the two are combined into a single
    structure, there will also be a field to tell whether the event is
    instant or timed.  In addition, the timed structure will include
    the following fields:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A beginning event (optional, an event structure) </li>
    <li>An ending event (optional, an event structure) </li>
    <li>A start time (optional, a time in the game engine's format) </li>
    <li>An ending time (optional, a time in the game engine's format) </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The beginning and ending events are perceptible
    <strong>only</strong> if the timed event is perceived.  So no
    matter how easy they are to perceive on their own, if the event
    itself is not perceived, the beginning and ending events will not
    be perceived.  This prevents a character noticing the beginning of
    the metronome's ticking, but then being unable to hear it until it
    ceases.

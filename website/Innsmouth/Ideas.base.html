    <h3> 'Seed'-based building, a script-free build system </h3>

    <p>
      Imaging a builder system based on physical, manipulable objects,
      each extremely small and light.  Call them seeds.  Builders would
      be given unlimited access to seeds, which could be combined in
      nifty nested ways.  They would also receive unlimited tissue-paper
      bags, which held any reasonable number of seeds, but did nothing else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each builder would be given a very limited quantity of Ethereal
      Water (or whatever it wound up being called).  This Ethereal
      Water would contain both cycles of processor time and a certain
      number of quota units of seed-sprouting.  The processor time would
      be enough that it would rarely be a problem except with the most
      script-heavy seeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      This would have the advantage that large (external) objects would
      be created first since they would 'sprout' first before the
      Ethereal Water penetrated them to sprout everything inside.
      Infinite loops would be impossible because each builder would
      pour a limited amount of Ethereal Water at a time, so an
      infinite nesting would stop when the water was used up.
      The builder tools would be easy -- you simply manipulate objects
      and put them inside each other.  Builders would need to be
      able to see (and travel?) inside seeds to make really complex
      structures, and would need very large containers of Ethereal
      Water, but that'd be okay.  It'd be easy enough to make
      container seeds act as containers and room seeds be locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary advantage of seeds over, say, having the builder
      just create the objects directly is that the seeds can easily
      algorithmically generate slight variations on a theme.  For
      instance, a desk seed might generate a few pens and paperclips,
      a stray notepad and a small bottle of port in one case, or
      an ornate fountain pen and a few stray books in another.
      This allows builders to easily use scripted objects with
      minimal complexity.

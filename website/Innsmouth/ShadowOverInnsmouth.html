  <h2 align="center"> The Shadow Over Innsmouth </h2>
  <h4 align="center"> I </h4>

  <p>
    During the winter of 1927-28 officials of the Federal government
    made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in
    the ancient Massachusetts seaport of Innsmouth. The public first
    learned of it in February, when a vast series of raids and arrests
    occurred, followed by the deliberate burning and dynamiting -
    under suitable precautions - of an enormous number of crumbling,
    worm-eaten, and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned
    waterfront. Uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of
    the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor. </p>
 
        <p>Keener news-followers, however, wondered at the prodigious
          number of arrests, the abnormally large force of men used in
          making them, and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the
          prisoners. No trials, or even definite charges were
          reported; nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in
          the regular gaols of the nation. There were vague statements
          about disease and concentration camps, and later about
          dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing
          positive ever developed. Innsmouth itself was left almost
          depopulated, and it is even now only beginning to show signs
          of a sluggishly revived existence. </p>
 
        <p>Complaints from many liberal organizations were met with
          long confidential discussions, and representatives were
          taken on trips to certain camps and prisons.  As a result,
          these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent.
          Newspaper men were harder to manage, but seemed largely to
          cooperate with the government in the end. Only one paper - a
          tabloid always discounted because of its wild policy -
          mentioned the deep diving submarine that discharged
          torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond Devil
          Reef. That item, gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors,
          seemed indeed rather far-fetched; since the low, black reef
          lay a full mile and a half out from Innsmouth Harbour. </p>
 
        <p>People around the country and in the nearby towns muttered
          a great deal among themselves, but said very little to the
          outer world. They had talked about dying and half-deserted
          Innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new could be
          wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and
          hinted at years before. Many things had taught them
          secretiveness, and there was no need to exert pressure on
          them. Besides, they really knew little; for wide salt
          marshes, desolate and unpeopled, kept neighbors off from
          Innsmouth on the landward side. </p>
 
        <p>But at last I am going to defy the ban on speech about this
          thing. Results, I am certain, are so thorough that no public
          harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a
          hinting of what was found by those horrified men at
          Innsmouth. Besides, what was found might possibly have more
          than one explanation. I do not know just how much of the
          whole tale has been told even to me, and I have many reasons
          for not wishing to probe deeper.  For my contact with this
          affair has been closer than that of any other layman, and I
          have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to
          drastic measures. </p>
 
        <p>It was I who fled frantically out of Innsmouth in the early
          morning hours of July 16, 1927, and whose frightened appeals
          for government inquiry and action brought on the whole
          reported episode. I was willing enough to stay mute while
          the affair was fresh and uncertain; but now that it is an
          old story, with public interest and curiosity gone, I have
          an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in
          that ill-rumored and evilly-shadowed seaport of death and
          blasphemous abnormality. The mere telling helps me to
          restore confidence in my own faculties; to reassure myself
          that I was not the first to succumb to a contagious
          nightmare hallucination.  It helps me, too, in making up my
          mind regarding a certain terrible step which lies ahead of
          me. </p>
 
        <p>I never heard of Innsmouth till the day before I saw it for
          the first and - so far - last time. I was celebrating my
          coming of age by a tour of New England - sightseeing,
          antiquarian, and genealogical - and had planned to go
          directly from ancient Newburyport to Arkham, whence my
          mother's family was derived. I had no car, but was
          travelling by train, trolley and motor-coach, always seeking
          the cheapest possible route. In Newburyport they told me
          that the steam train was the thing to take to Arkham; and it
          was only at the station ticket-office, when I demurred at
          the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth. The stout,
          shrewd-faced agent, whose speech shewed him to be no local
          man, seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy, and
          made a suggestion that none of my other informants had
          offered. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;You could take that old bus, I suppose,&quot; he said
          with a certain hesitation, &quot;but it ain't thought much
          of hereabouts. It goes through Innsmouth - you may have
          heard about that - and so the people don't like it. Run by
          an Innsmouth fellow - Joe Sargent - but never gets any
          custom from here, or Arkham either, I guess. Wonder it keeps
          running at all. I s'pose it's cheap enough, but I never see
          mor'n two or three people in it - nobody but those Innsmouth
          folk. Leaves the square - front of Hammond's Drug Store - at
          10 a.m. and 7 p.m. unless they've changed lately. Looks like
          a terrible rattletrap - I've never been on it.&quot; </p>
 
        <p>That was the first I ever heard of shadowed Innsmouth. Any
          reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in
          recent guidebooks would have interested me, and the agent's
          odd manner of allusion roused something like real
          curiosity. A town able to inspire such dislike in it its
          neighbors, I thought, must be at least rather unusual, and
          worthy of a tourist's attention. If it came before Arkham I
          would stop off there and so I asked the agent to tell me
          something about it. He was very deliberate, and spoke with
          an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Innsmouth? Well, it's a queer kind of a town down at
          the mouth of the Manuxet. Used to be almost a city - quite a
          port before the War of 1812 - but all gone to pieces in the
          last hundred years or so. No railroad now - B. and M. never
          went through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up
          years ago. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and
          no business to speak of except fishing and
          lobstering. Everybody trades mostly either here or in Arkham
          or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing's
          left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest
          kind of part time. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That refinery, though, used to he a big thing, and
          old man Marsh, who owns it, must be richer'n Croesus. Queer
          old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in his home. He's
          supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity
          late in life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandson of
          Captain Obed Marsh, who founded the business. His mother
          seems to've been some kind of foreigner - they say a South
          Sea islander - so everybody raised Cain when he married an
          Ipswich girl fifty years ago. They always do that about
          Innsmouth people, and folks here and hereabouts always try
          to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in 'em. But
          Marsh's children and grandchildren look just like anyone
          else far's I can see. I've had 'em pointed out to me here -
          though, come to think of it, the elder children don't seem
          to be around lately. Never saw the old man. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well,
          young fellow, you mustn't take too much stock in what people
          here say. They're hard to get started, but once they do get
          started they never let up. They've been telling things about
          Innsmouth - whispering 'em, mostly - for the last hundred
          years, I guess, and I gather they're more scared than
          anything else. Some of the stories would make you laugh -
          about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and
          bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about
          some kind of devil-worship and awful sacrifices in some
          place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845
          or thereabouts - but I come from Panton, Vermont, and that
          kind of story don't go down with me.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;You ought to hear, though, what some of the
          old-timers tell about the black reef off the coast - Devil
          Reef, they call it. It's well above water a good part of the
          time, and never much below it, but at that you could hardly
          call it an island. The story is that there's a whole legion
          of devils seen sometimes on that reef - sprawled about, or
          darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top. It's
          a rugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and
          toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big
          detours just to avoid it. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That is, sailors that didn't hail from Innsmouth. One
          of the things they had against old Captain Marsh was that he
          was supposed to land on it sometimes at night when the tide
          was right. Maybe he did, for I dare say the rock formation
          was interesting, and it's just barely possible he was
          looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it; but there was
          talk of his dealing with demons there. Fact is, I guess on
          the whole it was really the Captain that gave the bad
          reputation to the reef. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over
          half the folks in Innsmouth was carried off. They never did
          quite figure out what the trouble was, but it was probably
          some foreign kind of disease brought from China or somewhere
          by the shipping. It surely was bad enough - there was riots
          over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that I don't
          believe ever got outside of town - and it left the place in
          awful shape. Never came back - there can't be more'n 300 or
          400 people living there now. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;But the real thing behind the way folks feel is
          simply race prejudice - and I don't say I'm blaming those
          that hold it. I hate those Innsmouth folks myself, and I
          wouldn't care to go to their town. I s'pose you know -
          though I can see you're a Westerner by your talk - what a
          lot our New England ships - used to have to do with queer
          ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else,
          and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back
          with 'em. You've probably heard about the Salem man that
          came home with a Chinese wife, and maybe you know there's
          still a bunch of Fiji Islanders somewhere around Cape
          Cod. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Well, there must be something like that back of the
          Innsmouth people. The place always was badly cut off from
          the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we can't
          be sure about the ins and outs of the matter; but it's
          pretty clear that old Captain Marsh must have brought home
          some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in
          commission back in the twenties and thirties. There
          certainly is a strange kind of streak in the Innsmouth folks
          today - I don't know how to explain it but it sort of makes
          you crawl. You'll notice a little in Sargent if you take his
          bus. Some of 'em have queer narrow heads with flat noses and
          bulgy, starry eyes that never seem to shut, and their skin
          ain't quite right.  Rough and scabby, and the sides of the
          necks are all shriveled or creased up. Get bald, too, very
          young. The older fellows look the worst - fact is, I don't
          believe I've ever seen a very old chap of that kind. Guess
          they must die of looking in the glass! Animals hate 'em -
          they used to have lots of horse trouble before the autos
          came in. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Nobody around here or in Arkham or Ipswich will have
          anything to do with 'em, and they act kind of offish
          themselves when they come to town or when anyone tries to
          fish on their grounds. Queer how fish are always thick off
          Innsmouth Harbour when there ain't any anywhere else around
          - but just try to fish there yourself and see how the folks
          chase you off! Those people used to come here on the
          railroad - walking and taking the train at Rowley after the
          branch was dropped - but now they use that bus.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Yes, there's a hotel in Innsmouth - called the Gilman
          House - but I don't believe it can amount to much. I
          wouldn't advise you to try it. Better stay over here and
          take the ten o'clock bus tomorrow morning; then you can get
          an evening bus there for Arkham at eight o'clock. There was
          a factory inspector who stopped at the Gilman a couple of
          years ago and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the
          place. Seems they get a queer crowd there, for this fellow
          heard voices in other rooms - though most of 'em was empty -
          that gave him the shivers. It was foreign talk he thought,
          but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice
          that sometimes spoke. It sounded so unnatural - slopping
          like, he said - that he didn't dare undress and go to
          sleep. Just waited up and lit out the first thing in the
          morning. The talk went on most all night. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;This fellow - Casey, his name was - had a lot to say
          about how the Innsmouth folk, watched him and seemed kind of
          on guard. He found the Marsh refinery a queer place - it's
          in an old mill on the lower falls of the Manuxet. What he
          said tallied up with what I'd heard. Books in bad shape, and
          no clear account of any kind of dealings. You know it's
          always been a kind of mystery where the Marshes get the gold
          they refine. They've never seemed to do much buying in that
          line, but years ago they shipped out an enormous lot of
          ingots. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewelry
          that the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly,
          or that was seen once or twice on some of the Marsh
          women-folks. People allowed maybe old Captain Obed traded
          for it in some heathen port, especially since he always
          ordered stacks of glass beads and trinkets such as seafaring
          men used to get for native trade. Others thought and still
          think he'd found an old pirate cache out on Devil Reef. But
          here's a funny thing. The old Captain's been dead these
          sixty years, and there's ain't been a good-sized ship out of
          the place since the Civil War; but just the same the Marshes
          still keep on buying a few of those native trade things -
          mostly glass and rubber gewgaws, they tell me. Maybe the
          Innsmouth folks like 'em to look at themselves - Gawd knows
          they've gotten to be about as bad as South Sea cannibals and
          Guinea savages. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That plague of '46 must have taken off the best blood
          in the place. Anyway, they're a doubtful lot now, and the
          Marshes and other rich folks are as bad as any. As I told
          you, there probably ain't more'n 400 people in the whole
          town in spite of all the streets they say there are. I guess
          they're what they call 'white trash' down South - lawless
          and sly, and full of secret things. They get a lot of fish
          and lobsters and do exporting by truck. Queer how the fish
          swarm right there and nowhere else. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Nobody can ever keep track of these people, and state
          school officials and census men have a devil of a time. You
          can bet that prying strangers ain't welcome around
          Innsmouth. I've heard personally of more'n one business or
          government man that's disappeared there, and there's loose
          talk of one who went crazy and is out at Danvers now. They
          must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That's why I wouldn't go at night if I was you. I've
          never been there and have no wish to go, but I guess a
          daytime trip couldn't hurt you - even though the people
          hereabouts will advise you not to make it. If you're just
          sightseeing, and looking for old-time stuff, Innsmouth ought
          to be quite a place for you.&quot; </p>
 
        <p>And so I spent part of that evening at the Newburyport
          Public Library looking up data about Innsmouth. When I had
          tried to question the natives in the shops, the lunchroom,
          the garages, and the fire station, I had found them even
          harder to get started than the ticket agent had predicted;
          and realized that I could not spare the time to overcome
          their first instinctive reticence. They had a kind of
          obscure suspiciousness, as if there were something amiss
          with anyone too much interested in Innsmouth. At the
          Y. M. C. A., where I was stopping, the clerk merely
          discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and
          the people at the library shewed much the same
          attitude. Clearly, in the eyes of the educated, Innsmouth
          was merely an exaggerated case of civic degeneration. </p>
 
        <p>The Essex County histories on the library shelves had very
          little to say, except that the town was founded in 1643,
          noted for shipbuilding before the Revolution, a seat of
          great marine prosperity in the early 19th century, and later
          a minor factory center using the Manuxet as power. The
          epidemic and riots of 1846 were very sparsely treated, as if
          they formed a discredit to the county. </p>
 
        <p>References to decline were few, though the significance of
          the later record was unmistakable.  After the Civil War all
          industrial life was confined to the Marsh Refining Company,
          and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining
          bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing. That
          fishing paid less and less as the price of the commodity
          fell and large-scale corporations offered competition, but
          there was never a dearth of fish around Innsmouth
          Harbour. Foreigners seldom settled there, and there was some
          discreetly veiled evidence that a number of Poles and
          Portuguese who had tried it had been scattered in a
          peculiarly drastic fashion. </p>
 
        <p>Most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the
          strange jewelry vaguely associated with Innsmouth. It had
          evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a
          little, for mention was made of specimens in the museum of
          Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in the display room of
          the Newburyport Historical Society. The fragmentary
          descriptions of these things were bald and prosaic, but they
          hinted to me an undercurrent of persistent strangeness.
          Something about them seemed so odd and provocative that I
          could not put them out of my mind, and despite the relative
          lateness of the hour I resolved to see the local sample -
          said to be a large, queerly-proportioned thing evidently
          meant for a tiara - if it could possibly be arranged.
          </p>
 
        <p>The librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator
          of the Society, a Miss Anna Tilton, who lived nearby, and
          after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind
          enough to pilot me into the closed building, since the hour
          was not outrageously late. The collection was a notable one
          indeed, but in my present mood I had eyes for nothing but
          the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard
          under the electric lights.
          </p>
 
        <p>It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me
          literally gasp at the strange, unearthly splendour of the
          alien, opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet
          cushion. Even now I can hardly describe what I saw, though
          it was clearly enough a sort of tiara, as the description
          had said. It was tall in front, and with a very large and
          curiously irregular periphery, as if designed for a head of
          almost freakishly elliptical outline. The material seemed to
          be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness
          hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and
          scarcely identifiable metal. Its condition was almost
          perfect, and one could have spent hours in studying the
          striking and puzzlingly untraditional designs - some simply
          geometrical, and some plainly marine - chased or moulded in
          high relief on its surface with a craftsmanship of
          incredible skill and grace. </p>
 
        <p>The longer I looked, the more the thing fascinated me; and
          in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element
          hardly to be classified or accounted for. At first I decided
          that it was the queer other-worldly quality of the art which
          made me uneasy. All other art objects I had ever seen either
          belonged to some known racial or national stream, or else
          were consciously modernistic defiances of every recognized
          stream. This tiara was neither. It clearly belonged to some
          settled technique of infinite maturity and perfection, yet
          that technique was utterly remote from any - Eastern or
          Western, ancient or modern - which I had ever heard of or
          seen exemplified. It was as if the workmanship were that of
          another planet. </p>
 
        <p>However, I soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and
          perhaps equally potent source residing in the pictorial and
          mathematical suggestion of the strange designs. The patterns
          all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in
          time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the
          reliefs became almost sinister. Among these reliefs were
          fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignity -
          half ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestion - which one
          could not dissociate from a certain haunting and
          uncomfortable sense of pseudomemory, as if they called up
          some image from deep cells and tissues whose retentive
          functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral. At
          times I fancied that every contour of these blasphemous
          fish-frogs was over-flowing with the ultimate quintessence
          of unknown and inhuman evil. </p>
 
        <p>In odd contrast to the tiara's aspect was its brief and
          prosy history as related by Miss Tilton. It had been pawned
          for a ridiculous sum at a shop in State Street in 1873, by a
          drunken Innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a
          brawl. The Society had acquired it directly from the
          pawnbroker, at once giving it a display worthy of its
          quality. It was labeled as of probable East-Indian or
          Indochinese provenance, though the attribution was frankly
          tentative. </p>
 
        <p>Miss Tilton, comparing all possible hypotheses regarding
          its origin and its presence in New England, was inclined to
          believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard
          discovered by old Captain Obed Marsh. This view was surely
          not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high
          price which the Marshes began to make as soon as they knew
          of its presence, and which they repeated to this day despite
          the Society's unvarying determination not to sell. </p>
 
        <p>As the good lady shewed me out of the building she made it
          clear that the pirate theory of the Marsh fortune was a
          popular one among the intelligent people of the region. Her
          own attitude toward shadowed Innsmouth - which she never
          seen - was one of disgust at a community slipping far down
          the cultural scale, and she assured me that the rumours of
          devil-worship were partly justified by a peculiar secret
          cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the
          orthodox churches. </p>
 
        <p>It was called, she said, &quot;The Esoteric Order of
          Dagon&quot;, and was undoubtedly a debased, quasi-pagan
          thing imported from the East a century before, at a time
          when the Innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren. Its
          persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view
          of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine
          fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence in
          the town, replacing Freemasonry altogether and taking up
          headquarters in the old Masonic Hall on New Church
          Green. </p>
 
        <p>All this, to the pious Miss Tilton, formed an excellent
          reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and
          desolation; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive.  To
          my architectural and historical anticipations was now added
          an acute anthropological zeal, and I could scarcely sleep in
          my small room at the &quot;Y&quot; as the night wore
          away. </p>
 
        <h4 align="center">II</h4>

        <p>Shortly before ten the next morning I stood with one small
          valise in front of Hammond's Drug Store in old Market Square
          waiting for the Innsmouth bus. As the hour for its arrival
          drew near I noticed a general drift of the loungers to other
          places up the street, or to the Ideal Lunch across the
          square.  Evidently the ticket-agent had not exaggerated the
          dislike which local People bore toward Innsmouth and its
          denizens. In a few moments a small motor-coach of extreme
          decrepitude and dirty grey colour rattled down State Street,
          made a turn, and drew up at the curb beside me. I felt
          immediately that it was the right one; a guess which the
          half-illegible sign on the windshield -
          Arkham-Innsmouth-Newburyport - soon verified.
          </p>
 
        <p>There were only three passengers - dark, unkempt men of
          sullen visage and somewhat youthful cast - and when the
          vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking
          up State Street in a silent, almost furtive fashion. The
          driver also alighted, and I watched him as he went into the
          drug store to make some purchase. This, I reflected, must be
          the Joe Sargent mentioned by the ticket-agent; and even
          before I noticed any details there spread over me a wave of
          spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor
          explained. It suddenly struck me as very natural that the
          local people should not wish to ride on a bus owned and
          driven by this man, or to visit any oftener than possible
          the habitat of such a man and his kinsfolk. </p>
 
        <p>When the driver came out of the store I looked at him more
          carefully and tried to determine the source of my evil
          impression. He was a thin, stoop-shouldered man not much
          under six feet tall, dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes
          and wearing a frayed golf cap. His age was perhaps
          thirty-five, but the odd, deep creases in the sides of his
          neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull,
          expressionless face. He had a narrow head, bulging,
          watery-blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a
          receding forehead and chin, and singularly undeveloped
          ears. His long thick lip and coarse-pored, greyish cheeks
          seemed almost beardless except for some sparse yellow hairs
          that straggled and curled in irregular patches; and in
          places the surface seemed queerly irregular, as if peeling
          from some cutaneous disease. His hands were large and
          heavily veined, and had a very unusual greyish-blue
          tinge. The fingers were strikingly short in proportion to
          the rest of the structure, and seemed to have a tendency to
          curl closely into the huge palm. As he walked toward the bus
          I observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his
          feet were inordinately immense. The more I studied them the
          more I wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them. </p>
 
        <p>A certain greasiness about the fellow increased my
          dislike. He was evidently given to working or lounging
          around the fish docks, and carried with him much of their
          characteristic smell. Just what foreign blood was in him I
          could not even guess. His oddities certainly did not look
          Asiatic, Polynesian, Levantine or negroid, yet I could see
          why the people found him alien.  I myself would have thought
          of biological degeneration rather than alienage.
          </p>
 
        <p>I was sorry when I saw there would be no other passengers
          on the bus. Somehow I did not like the idea of riding alone
          with this driver. But as leaving time obviously approached I
          conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard, extending
          him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word
          &quot;Innsmouth.&quot; He looked curiously at me for a
          second as he returned forty cents change without speaking. I
          took a seat far behind him, but on the same side of the bus,
          since I wished to watch the shore during the journey. </p>
 
        <p>At length the decrepit vehicle stared with a jerk, and
          rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of State Street
          amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust. Glancing at the
          people on the sidewalks, I thought I detected in them a
          curious wish to avoid looking at the bus - or at least a
          wish to avoid seeming to look at it. Then we turned to the
          left into High Street, where the going was smoother; flying
          by stately old mansions of the early republic and still
          older colonial farmhouses, passing the Lower Green and
          Parker River, and finally emerging into a long, monotonous
          stretch of open shore country. </p>
 
        <p>The day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand and
          sedge-grass, and stunted shrubbery became more and desolate
          as we proceeded. Out the window I could see the blue water
          and the sandy line of Plum Island, and we presently drew
          very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the
          main highway to Rowley and Ipswich. There were no visible
          houses, and I could tell by the state of the road that
          traffic was very light hereabouts. The weather-worn
          telephone poles carried only two wires. Now and then we
          crossed crude wooden bridges over tidal creeks that wound
          far inland and promoted the general isolation of the
          region. </p>
 
        <p>Once in a while I noticed dead stumps and crumbling
          foundation-walls above the drifting sand, and recalled the
          old tradition quoted in one of the histories I had read,
          that this was once a fertile and thickly-settled
          countryside.  The change, it was said, came simultaneously
          with the Innsmouth epidemic of l846, and was thought by
          simple folk to have a dark connection with hidden forces of
          evil. Actually, it was caused by the unwise cutting of
          woodlands near the shore, which robbed the soil of the best
          protection and opened the way for waves of wind-blown
          sand. </p>
 
        <p>At last we lost sight of Plum Island and saw the vast
          expanse of the open Atlantic on our left. Our narrow course
          began to climb steeply, and I felt a singular sense of
          disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the
          rutted road-way met the sky. It was as if the bus were about
          to keep on in its ascent, leaving the sane earth altogether
          and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and
          cryptical sky. The smell of the sea took on ominous
          implications, and the silent driver's bent, rigid back and
          narrow head became more and more hateful. As I looked at him
          I saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as
          his face, having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a
          grey scabrous surface. </p>
 
        <p>Then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley
          beyond, where the Manuxet joins the sea just north of the
          long line of cliffs that culminate in Kingsport Head and
          veer off toward Cape Ann. On the far misty horizon I could
          just make out the dizzy profile of the Head, topped by the
          queer ancient house of which so many legends are told; but
          for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer
          panorama just below me.  I had, I realized, come face to
          face with rumour-shadowed Innsmouth.
          </p>
 
        <p>It was a town of wide extent and dense construction, yet
          one with a portentous dearth of visible life. From the
          tangle of chimney-pots scarcely a wisp of smoke came, and
          the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against
          the seaward horizon. One of them was crumbling down at the
          top, and in that and another there were only black gaping
          holes where clock-dials should have been. The vast huddle of
          sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with
          offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay, and as we
          approached along the now descending road I could see that
          many roofs had wholly caved in. There were some large square
          Georgian houses, too, with hipped roofs, cupolas, and railed
          &quot;widow's walks.&quot; These were mostly well back from
          the water, and one or two seemed to be in moderately sound
          condition. Stretching inland from among them I saw the
          rusted, grass-grown line of the abandoned railway, with
          leaning telegraph-poles now devoid of wires, and the
          half-obscured lines of the old carriage roads to Rowley and
          Ipswich. </p>
 
        <p>The decay was worst close to the waterfront, though in its
          very midst I could spy the white belfry of a fairly well
          preserved brick structure which looked like a small
          factory. The harbour, long clogged with sand, was enclosed
          by an ancient stone breakwater; on which I could begin to
          discern the minute forms of a few seated fishermen, and at
          whose end were what looked like the foundations of a bygone
          lighthouse. A sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier
          and upon it I saw a few decrepit cabins, moored dories, and
          scattered lobster-pots. The only deep water seemed to be
          where the river poured out past the belfried structure and
          turned southward to join the ocean at the breakwater's
          end. </p>
 
        <p>Here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the
          shore to end in indeterminate rottenness, those farthest
          south seeming the most decayed. And far out at sea, despite
          a high tide, I glimpsed a long, black line scarcely rising
          above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent
          malignancy. This, I knew, must be Devil Reef. As I looked, a
          subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the
          grim repulsion; and oddly enough, I found this overtone more
          disturbing than the primary impression. </p>
 
        <p>We met no one on the road, but presently began to pass
          deserted farms in varying stages of ruin. Then I noticed a
          few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows
          and shells and dead fish lying about the littered
          yards. Once or twice I saw listless-looking people working
          in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling
          beach below, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged children
          playing around weed-grown doorsteps.  Somehow these people
          seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings, for
          almost every one had certain peculiarities of face and
          motions which I instinctively disliked without being able to
          define or comprehend them. For a second I thought this
          typical physique suggested some picture I had seen, perhaps
          in a book, under circumstances of particular horror or
          melancholy; but this pseudo-recollection passed very
          quickly. </p>
 
        <p>As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the
          steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness,
          The leaning, unpainted houses grew thicker, lined both sides
          of the road, and displayed more urban tendencies than did
          those we were leaving behind, The panorama ahead had
          contracted to a street scene, and in spots I could see where
          a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had
          formerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted,
          and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and
          cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed. Pervading
          everything was the most nauseous fishy odour
          imaginable. </p>
 
        <p>Soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on
          the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and
          decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed
          grandeur. So far I had seen no people in the town, but there
          now came signs of a sparse habitation - curtained windows
          here and there, and an occasional battered motorcar at the
          curb. Pavement and sidewalks were increasingly well-defined,
          and though most of the houses were quite old - wood and
          brick structures of the early 19th century - they were
          obviously kept fit for habitation. As an amateur antiquarian
          I almost lost my olfactory disgust and my feeling of menace
          and repulsion amidst this rich, unaltered survival from the
          past. </p>
 
        <p>But I was not to reach my destination without one very
          strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality. The
          bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point
          with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a
          circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large
          pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The
          structure's once white paint was now gray and peeling and
          the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I
          could only with difficulty make out the words &quot;Esoteric
          Order of Dagon&quot;. This, then was the former Masonic Hall
          now given over to a degraded cult. As I strained to decipher
          this inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous
          tones of a cracked bell across the street, and I quickly
          turned to look out the window on my side of the coach.
          </p>
 
        <p>The sound came from a squat stone church of manifestly
          later date than most of the houses, built in a clumsy Gothic
          fashion and having a disproportionately high basement with
          shuttered windows. Though the hands of its clock were
          missing on the side I glimpsed, I knew that those hoarse
          strokes were tolling the hour of eleven. Then suddenly all
          thoughts of time were blotted out by an onrushing image of
          sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seized me
          before I knew what it really was. The door of the church
          basement was open, revealing a rectangle of blackness
          inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed or seemed
          to cross that dark rectangle; burning into my brain a
          momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more
          maddening because analysis could not shew a single
          nightmarish quality in it. </p>
 
        <p>It was a living object - the first except the driver that I
          had seen since entering the compact part of the town - and
          had I been in a steadier mood I would have found nothing
          whatever of terror in it. Clearly, as I realised a moment
          later, it was the pastor; clad in some peculiar vestments
          doubtless introduced since the Order of Dagon had modified
          the ritual of the local churches. The thing which had
          probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied
          the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an
          almost exact duplicate of the one Miss Tilton had shown me
          the previous evening. This, acting on my imagination, had
          supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate
          face and robed, shambling form beneath it. There was not, I
          soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that
          shuddering touch of evil pseudo-memory. Was it not natural
          that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals
          an unique type of head-dress made familiar to the community
          in some strange way - perhaps as treasure-trove? </p>
 
        <p>A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people
          now became visible on the sidewalks - lone individuals, and
          silent knots of two or three. The lower floors of the
          crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy
          signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled
          along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more
          distinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge
          ahead, spanned by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge beyond
          which a large square opened out. As we clanked over the
          bridge I looked out on both sides and observed some factory
          buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way
          down. The water far below was very abundant, and I could see
          two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least
          one downstream on my left. From this point the noise was
          quite deafening. Then we rolled into the large semicircular
          square across the river and drew up on the right-hand side
          in front of a tall, cupola crowned building with remnants of
          yellow paint and with a half-effaced sign proclaiming it to
          be the Gilman House. </p>
 
        <p>I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to
          check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby. There was only
          one person in sight - an elderly man without what I had come
          to call the &quot;Innsmouth look&quot; - and I decided not
          to ask him any of the questions which bothered me;
          remembering that odd things had been noticed in this
          hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the square, from which the
          bus had already gone, and studied the scene minutely and
          appraisingly. </p>
 
        <p>One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight
          line of the river; the other was a semicircle of
          slant-roofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period, from
          which several streets radiated away to the southeast, south,
          and southwest. Lamps were depressingly few and small - all
          low-powered incandescents - and I was glad that my plans
          called for departure before dark, even though I knew the
          moon would be bright. The buildings were all in fair
          condition, and included perhaps a dozen shops in current
          operation; of which one was a grocery of the First National
          chain, others a dismal restaurant, a drug store, and a
          wholesale fish-dealer's office, and still another, at the
          eastward extremity of the square near the river an office of
          the town's only industry - the Marsh Refining Company.
          There were perhaps ten people visible, and four or five
          automobiles and motor trucks stood scattered about. I did
          not need to be told that this was the civic centre of
          Innsmouth. Eastward I could catch blue glimpses of the
          harbour, against which rose the decaying remains of three
          once beautiful Georgian steeples. And toward the shore on
          the opposite bank of the river I saw the white belfry
          surmounting what I took to be the Marsh refinery. </p>
 
        <p>For some reason or other I chose to make my first inquiries
          at the chain grocery, whose personnel was not likely to be
          native to Innsmouth. I found a solitary boy of about
          seventeen in charge, and was pleased to note the brightness
          and affability which promised cheerful information. He
          seemed exceptionally eager to talk, and I soon gathered that
          he did not like the place, its fishy smell, or its furtive
          people. A word with any outsider was a relief to him. He
          hailed from Arkham, boarded with a family who came from
          Ipswich, and went back whenever he got a moment off. His
          family did not like him to work in Innsmouth, but the chain
          had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his
          job. </p>
 
        <p>There was, he said, no public library or chamber of
          commerce in Innsmouth, but I could probably find my way
          about. The street I had come down was Federal. West of that
          were the fine old residence streets - Broad, Washington,
          Lafayette, and Adams - and east of it were the shoreward
          slums. It was in these slums - along Main Street - that I
          would find the old Georgian churches, but they were all long
          abandoned. It would be well not to make oneself too
          conspicuous in such neighbourhoods - especially north of the
          river since the people were sullen and hostile. Some
          strangers had even disappeared.
          </p>
 
        <p>Certain spots were almost forbidden territory, as he had
          learned at considerable cost.  One must not, for example,
          linger much around the Marsh refinery, or around any of the
          still used churches, or around the pillared Order of Dagon
          Hall at New Church Green. Those churches were very odd - all
          violently disavowed by their respective denominations
          elsewhere, and apparently using the queerest kind of
          ceremonials and clerical vestments.  Their creeds were
          heterodox and mysterious, involving hints of certain
          marvelous transformations leading to bodily immorality - of
          a sort - on this earth. The youth's own pastor - Dr. Wallace
          of Asbury M. E.  Church in Arkham - had gravely urged him
          not to join any church in Innsmouth.
          </p>
 
        <p>As for the Innsmouth people - the youth hardly knew what to
          make of them. They were as furtive and seldom seen as
          animals that live in burrows, and one could hardly imagine
          how they passed the time apart from their desultory fishing.
          Perhaps - judging from the quantities of bootleg liquor they
          consumed - they lay for most of the daylight hours in an
          alcoholic stupor. They seemed sullenly banded together in
          some sort of fellowship and understanding - despising the
          world as if they had access to other and preferable spheres
          of entity. Their appearance - especially those staring,
          unwinking eyes which one never saw shut - was certainly
          shocking enough; and their voices were disgusting. It was
          awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night, and
          especially during their main festivals or revivals, which
          fell twice a year on April 30th and October 31st. </p>
 
        <p>They were very fond of the water, and swam a great deal in
          both river and harbour. Swimming races out to Devil Reef
          were very common, and everyone in sight seemed well able to
          share in this arduous sport. When one came to think of it,
          it was generally only rather young people who were seen
          about in public, and of these the oldest were apt to be the
          most tainted-looking.  When exceptions did occur, they were
          mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy, like the old
          clerk at the hotel. One wondered what became of the bulk of
          the older folk, and whether the &quot;Innsmouth look&quot;
          were not a strange and insidious disease-phenomenon which
          increased its hold as years advanced. </p>
 
        <p>Only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about
          such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single
          individual after maturity - changes invoking osseous factors
          as basic as the shape of the skull - but then, even this
          aspect was no more baffling and unheard-of than the visible
          features of the malady as a whole. It would be hard, the
          youth implied, to form any real conclusions regarding such a
          matter; since one never came to know the natives personally
          no matter how long one might live in Innsmouth.
          </p>
 
        <p>The youth was certain that many specimens even worse than
          the worst visible ones were kept locked indoors in some
          places. People sometimes heard the queerest kind of
          sounds. The tottering waterfront hovels north of the river
          were reputedly connected by hidden tunnels, being thus a
          veritable warren of unseen abnormalities. What kind of
          foreign blood - if any - these beings had, it was impossible
          to tell. They sometimes kept certain especially repulsive
          characters out of sight when government and others from the
          outside world came to town. </p>
 
        <p>It would be of no use, my informant said, to ask the
          natives anything about the place.  The only one who would
          talk was a very aged but normal looking man who lived at the
          poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time
          walking about or lounging around the fire station. This
          hoary character, Zadok Allen, was 96 years old and somewhat
          touched in the head, besides being the town drunkard. He was
          a strange, furtive creature who constantly looked over his
          shoulder as if afraid of something, and when sober could not
          be persuaded to talk at all with strangers. He was, however,
          unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison; and once
          drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of
          whispered reminiscence. </p>
 
        <p>After all, though, little useful data could be gained from
          him; since his stories were all insane, incomplete hints of
          impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source
          save in his own disordered fancy. Nobody ever believed him,
          but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with
          strangers; and it was not always safe to be seen questioning
          him. It was probably from him that some of the wildest
          popular whispers and delusions were derived. </p>
 
        <p>Several non-native residents had reported monstrous
          glimpses from time to time, but between old Zadok's tales
          and the malformed inhabitants it was no wonder such
          illusions were current. None of the non-natives ever stayed
          out late at night, there being a widespread impression that
          it was not wise to do so. Besides, the streets were
          loathsomely dark. </p>
 
        <p>As for business - the abundance of fish was certainly
          almost uncanny, but the natives were taking less and less
          advantage of it. Moreover, prices were falling and
          competition was growing. Of course the town's real business
          was the refinery, whose commercial office was on the square
          only a few doors east of where we stood. Old Man Marsh was
          never seen, but sometimes went to the works in a closed,
          curtained car. </p>
 
        <p>There were all sorts of rumors about how Marsh had come to
          look. He had once been a great dandy; and people said he
          still wore the frock-coated finery of the Edwardian age
          curiously adapted to certain deformities. His son had
          formerly conducted the office in the square, but latterly
          they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leaving
          the brunt of affairs to the younger generation. The sons and
          their sisters had come to look very queer, especially the
          elder ones; and it was said that their health was
          failing. </p>
 
        <p>One of the Marsh daughters was a repellent,
          reptilian-looking woman who wore an excess of weird
          jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to
          which the strange tiara belonged. My informant had noticed
          it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from
          some secret hoard, either of pirates or of demons. The
          clergymen - or priests, or whatever they were called
          nowadays - also wore this kind of ornament as a headdress;
          but one seldom caught glimpses of them. Other specimens the
          youth had not seen, though many were rumoured to exist
          around Innsmouth. </p>
 
        <p>The Marshes, together with the other three gently bred
          families of the town - the Waites, the Gilmans, and the
          Eliots - were all very retiring. They lived in immense
          houses along Washington Street, and several were reputed to
          harbour in concealment certain living kinsfolk whose
          personal aspect forbade public view, and whose deaths had
          been reported and recorded.
          </p>
 
        <p>Warning me that many of the street signs were down, the
          youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking
          sketch map of the town's salient features.  After a moment's
          study I felt sure that it would be of great help, and
          pocketed it with profuse thanks. Disliking the dinginess of
          the single restaurant I had seen, I bought a fair supply of
          cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later
          on. My program, I decided, would be to thread the principal
          streets, talk with any non-natives I might encounter, and
          catch the eight o'clock coach for Arkham. The town, I could
          see, formed a significant and exaggerated example of
          communal decay; but being no sociologist I would limit my
          serious observations to the field of architecture. </p>
 
        <p>Thus I began my systematic though half-bewildered tour of
          Innsmouth's narrow, shadow-blighted ways. Crossing the
          bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls, I
          passed close to the Marsh refinery, which seemed to be oddly
          free from the noise of industry. The building stood on the
          steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of
          streets which I took to be the earliest civic center,
          displaced after the Revolution by the present Town
          Square. </p>
 
        <p>Re-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a
          region of utter desertion which somehow made me
          shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged
          and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish,
          decapitated steeple of an ancient church. Some houses along
          Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded
          up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping
          windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous
          and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the
          foundations.  Those windows stared so spectrally that it
          took courage to turn eastward toward the
          waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells
          in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as
          houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The
          sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and
          death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black,
          brooding compartments given over to cob-webs and memories
          and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and
          aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can
          disperse. </p>
 
        <p>Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in
          having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent
          shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, save that
          there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a
          living thing did I see except for the scattered fishermen on
          the distant break-water, and not a sound did I hear save the
          lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in
          the Manuxet. The town was getting more and more on my
          nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I picked my way
          back over the tottering Water Street bridge. The Fish Street
          bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins. </p>
 
        <p>North of the river there were traces of squalid life -
          active fish-packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys
          and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from
          indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the
          dismal streets and unpaved lanes - but I seemed to find this
          even more oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one
          thing, the people were more hideous and abnormal than those
          near the centre of the town; so that I was several times
          evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which I could
          not quite place. Undoubtedly the alien strain in the
          Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland -
          unless, indeed, the &quot;Innsmouth look&quot; were a
          disease rather than a blood stain, in which case this
          district might be held to harbour the more advanced
          cases. </p>
 
        <p>One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few
          faint sounds I heard. They ought naturally to have come
          wholly from the visibly inhabited houses, yet in reality
          were often strongest inside the most rigidly boarded-up
          facades. There were creakings, scurryings, and hoarse
          doubtful noises; and I thought uncomfortably about the
          hidden tunnels suggested by the grocery boy. Suddenly I
          found myself wondering what the voices of those denizens
          would be like. I had heard no speech so far in this quarter,
          and was unaccountably anxious not to do so. </p>
 
        <p>Pausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous
          old churches at Main and Church Streets, I hastened out of
          that vile waterfront slum. My next logical goal was New
          Church Green, but somehow or other I could not bear to
          repass the church in whose basement I had glimpsed the
          inexplicably frightening form of that strangely diademmed
          priest or pastor. Besides, the grocery youth had told me
          that churches, as well as the Order of Dagon Hall, were not
          advisable neighbourhoods for strangers. </p>
 
        <p>Accordingly I kept north along Main to Martin, then turning
          inland, crossing Federal Street safely north of the Green,
          and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern
          Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and Adams Streets. Though
          these stately old avenues were ill-surfaced and unkempt,
          their elm-shaded dignity had not entirely departed. Mansion
          after mansion claimed my gaze, most of them decrepit and
          boarded up amidst neglected grounds, but one or two in each
          street shewing signs of occupancy. In Washington Street
          there was a row of four or five in excellent repair and with
          finely-tended lawns and gardens. The most sumptuous of these
          - with wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way
          to Lafayette Street - I took to be the home of Old Man
          Marsh, the afflicted refinery owner.
          </p>
 
        <p>In all these streets no living thing was visible, and I
          wondered at the complete absence of cats and dogs from
          Innsmouth. Another thing which puzzled and disturbed me,
          even in some of the best-preserved mansions, was the tightly
          shuttered condition of many third-story and attic
          windows. Furtiveness and secretiveness seemed universal in
          this hushed city of alienage and death, and I could not
          escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every
          hand by sly, staring eyes that never shut. </p>
 
        <p>I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a
          belfry on my left. Too well did I recall the squat church
          from which those notes came. Following Washington street
          toward the river, I now faced a new zone of former industry
          and commerce; noting the ruins of a factory ahead, and
          seeing others, with the traces of an old railway station and
          covered railway bridge beyond, up the gorge on my
          right. </p>
 
        <p>The uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a
          warning sign, but I took the risk and crossed again to the
          south bank where traces of life reappeared. Furtive,
          shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction, and
          more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously. Innsmouth
          was rapidly becoming intolerable, and I turned down Paine
          Street toward the Square in the hope of getting some vehicle
          to take me to Arkham before the still-distant starting-time
          of that sinister bus. </p>
 
        <p>It was then that I saw the tumbledown fire station on my
          left, and noticed the red faced, bushy-bearded, watery eyed
          old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of
          it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal looking
          firemen. This, of course, must be Zadok Allen, the
          half-crazed, liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old
          Innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and
          incredible. </p>
 
        <h4 align="center">III</h4>

        <p>It must have been some imp of the perverse - or some
          sardonic pull from dark, hidden sources - which made me
          change my plans as I did. I had long before resolved to
          limit my observations to architecture alone, and I was even
          then hurrying toward the Square in an effort to get quick
          transportation out of this festering city of death and
          decay; but the sight of old Zadok Allen set up new currents
          in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly. </p>
 
        <p>I had been assured that the old man could do nothing but
          hint at wild, disjointed, and incredible legends, and I had
          been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen
          talking with him; yet the thought of this aged witness to
          the town's decay, with memories going back to the early days
          of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount of reason
          could make me resist.  After all, the strangest and maddest
          of myths are often merely symbols or allegories based upon
          truth - and old Zadok must have seen everything which went
          on around Innsmouth for the last ninety years. Curiosity
          flared up beyond sense and caution, and in my youthful
          egotism I fancied I might be able to sift a nucleus of real
          history from the confused, extravagant outpouring I would
          probably extract with the aid of raw whiskey. </p>
 
        <p>I knew that I could not accost him then and there, for the
          firemen would surely notice and object. Instead, I
          reflected, I would prepare by getting some bootleg liquor at
          a place where the grocery boy had told me it was plentiful.
          Then I would loaf near the fire station in apparent
          casualness, and fall in with old Zadok after he had started
          on one of his frequent rambles.  The youth had said that he
          was very restless, seldom sitting around the station for
          more than an hour or two at a time. </p>
 
        <p>A quart bottle of whiskey was easily, though not cheaply,
          obtained in the rear of a dingy variety-store just off the
          Square in Eliot Street. The dirty-looking fellow who waited
          on me had a touch of the staring &quot;Innsmouth look&quot;,
          but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to the
          custom of such convivial strangers - truckmen, gold-buyers,
          and the like - as were occasionally in town. </p>
 
        <p>Reentering the Square I saw that luck was with me; for -
          shuffling out of Paine street around the corner of the
          Gilman House - I glimpsed nothing less than the tall, lean,
          tattered form of old Zadok Allen himself. In accordance with
          my plan, I attracted his attention by brandishing my
          newly-purchased bottle: and soon realised that he had begun
          to shuffle wistfully after me as I turned into Waite Street
          on my way to the most deserted region I could think of. </p>
 
        <p>I was steering my course by the map the grocery boy had
          prepared, and was aiming for the wholly abandoned stretch of
          southern waterfront which I had previously visited. The only
          people in sight there had been the fishermen on the distant
          breakwater; and by going a few squares south I could get
          beyond the range of these, finding a pair of seats on some
          abandoned wharf and being free to question old Zadok
          unobserved for an indefinite time.  Before I reached Main
          Street I could hear a faint and wheezy &quot;Hey,
          Mister!&quot; behind me and I presently allowed the old man
          to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart
          bottle. </p>
 
        <p>I began putting out feelers as we walked amidst the
          omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins, but found
          that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as I had
          expected. At length I saw a grass-grown opening toward the
          sea between crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length of
          an earth-and-masonry wharf projecting beyond. Piles of
          moss-covered stones near the water promised tolerable seats,
          and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a
          ruined warehouse on the north. Here, I thought was the ideal
          place for a long secret colloquy; so I guided my companion
          down the lane and picked out spots to sit in among the mossy
          stones. The air of death and desertion was ghoulish, and the
          smell of fish almost insufferable; but I was resolved to let
          nothing deter me. </p>
 
        <p>About four hours remained for conversation if I were to
          catch the eight o'clock coach for Arkham, and I began to
          dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler; meanwhile
          eating my own frugal lunch. In my donations I was careful
          not to overshoot the mark, for I did not wish Zadok's vinous
          garrulousness to pass into a stupor. After an hour his
          furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing, but much
          to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about
          Innsmouth and its shadow-haunted past. He would babble of
          current topics, revealing a wide acquaintance with
          newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a
          sententious village fashion. </p>
 
        <p>Toward the end of the second hour I feared my quart of
          whiskey would not be enough to produce results, and was
          wondering whether I had better leave old Zadok and go back
          for more. Just then, however, chance made the opening which
          my questions had been unable to make; and the wheezing
          ancient's rambling took a turn that caused me to lean
          forward and listen alertly. My back was toward the
          fishy-smelling sea, but he was facing it and something or
          other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low,
          distant line of Devil Reef, then showing plainly and almost
          fascinatingly above the waves. The sight seemed to displease
          him, for he began a series of weak curses which ended in a
          confidential whisper and a knowing leer.  He bent toward me,
          took hold of my coat lapel, and hissed out some hints that
          could not be mistaken, </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Thar's whar it all begun - that cursed place of all
          wickedness whar the deep water starts. Gate o' hell - sheer
          drop daown to a bottom no saoundin'-line kin tech. Ol' Cap'n
          Obed done it - him that faound aout more'n was good fer him
          in the Saouth Sea islands. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Everybody was in a bad way them days. Trade fallin'
          off, mills losin' business - even the new ones - an' the
          best of our menfolks kilt aprivateerin' in the War of 1812
          or lost with the Elizy brig an' the Ranger scow - both on
          'em Gilman venters. Obed Marsh he had three ships afloat -
          brigantine Columby, brig Hefty, an' barque Sumatry Queen. He
          was the only one as kep' on with the East-Injy an' Pacific
          trade, though Esdras Martin's barkentine Malay Bride made a
          venter as late as twenty-eight. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Never was nobody like Cap'n Obed - old limb o' Satan!
          Heh, heh! I kin mind him a-tellin' abaout furren parts, an'
          callin' all the folks stupid for goin' to Christian meetin'
          an' bearin' their burdns meek an' lowly. Says they'd orter
          git better gods like some o' the folks in the Injies - gods
          as ud bring 'em good fishin' in return for their sacrifices,
          an' ud reely answer folks's prayers. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Matt Eliot his fust mate, talked a lot too, only he
          was again' folks's doin' any heathen things. Told abaout an
          island east of Othaheite whar they was a lot o' stone ruins
          older'n anybody knew anying abaout, kind o' like them on
          Ponape, in the Carolines, but with carven's of faces that
          looked like the big statues on Easter Island. Thar was a
          little volcanic island near thar, too, whar they was other
          ruins with diff'rent carvin' - ruins all wore away like
          they'd ben under the sea onct, an' with picters of awful
          monsters all over 'em. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Wal, Sir, Matt he says the natives anound thar had
          all the fish they cud ketch, an' sported bracelets an'
          armlets an' head rigs made aout o' a queer kind o' gold an'
          covered with picters o' monsters jest like the ones carved
          over the ruins on the little island - sorter fish-like frogs
          or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o' positions
          likes they was human bein's. Nobody cud get aout o' them
          whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives
          wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when
          the very next island had lean pickin's. Matt he got to
          wonderon' too an' so did Cap'n Obed. Obed he notices,
          besides, that lots of the hn'some young folks ud drop aout
          o' sight fer good from year to year, an' that they wan't
          many old folks around. Also, he thinks some of the folks
          looked dinned queer even for Kanakys. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;It took Obed to git the truth aout o' them heathen. I
          dun't know haow he done it, but be begun by tradin' fer the
          gold-like things they wore. Ast 'em whar they come from, an'
          ef they cud git more, an' finally wormed the story aout o'
          the old chief -- Walakea, they called him. Nobody but Obed
          ud ever a believed the old yeller devil, but the Cap'n cud
          read folks like they was books. Heh, heh! Nobody never
          believes me naow when I tell 'em, an' I dun't s'pose you
          will, young feller - though come to look at ye, ye hev kind
          o' got them sharp-readin' eyes like Obed had.&quot; </p>
 
        <p>The old man's whisper grew fainter, and I found myself
          shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his
          intonation, even though I knew his tale could be nothing but
          drunken phantasy. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Wal, Sir, Obed he 'lart that they's things on this
          arth as most folks never heerd about - an' wouldn't believe
          ef they did hear. lt seems these Kanakys was sacrificin'
          heaps o' their young men an' maidens to some kind o'
          god-things that lived under the sea, an' gittin' all kinds
          o' favour in return.  They met the things on the little
          islet with the queer ruins, an' it seems them awful picters
          o' frog-fish monsters was supposed to be picters o' these
          things. Mebbe they was the kind o' critters as got all the
          mermaid stories an' sech started. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;They had all kinds a' cities on the sea-bottom, an'
          this island was heaved up from thar.  Seem they was some of
          the things alive in the stone buildin's when the island come
          up sudden to the surface, That's how the Kanakys got wind
          they was daown thar. Made sign-talk as soon as they got over
          bein' skeert, an' pieced up a bargain afore long. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Them things liked human sacrifices. Had had 'em ages
          afore, but lost track o' the upper world after a time. What
          they done to the victims it ain't fer me to say, an' I guess
          Obed was'n't none too sharp abaout askin'. But it was all
          right with the heathens, because they'd ben havin' a hard
          time an' was desp'rate abaout everything. They give a sarten
          number o' young folks to the sea-things twice every year -
          May-Eve an' Hallawe'en - reg'lar as cud be. Also give some
          a' the carved knick-knacks they made.  What the things
          agreed to give in return was plenty a' fish - they druv 'em
          in from all over the sea - an' a few gold like things naow
          an' then.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Wal, as I says, the natives met the things on the
          little volcanic islet - goin' thar in canoes with the
          sacrifices et cet'ry, and bringin' back any of the gold-like
          jools as was comin' to 'em. At fust the things didn't never
          go onto the main island, but arter a time they come to want
          to. Seems they hankered arter mixin' with the folks, an'
          havin' j'int ceremonies on the big days - May-Eve an'
          Hallowe'en. Ye see, they was able to live both in ant aout
          o' water - what they call amphibians, I guess. The Kanakys
          told 'em as haow folks from the other islands might wanta
          wipe 'an out if they got wind o' their bein' thar, but they
          says they dun't keer much, because they cud wipe aout the
          hull brood o' humans ef they was willin' to bother - that
          is, any as didn't be, sarten signs sech as was used onct by
          the lost Old Ones, whoever they was. But not wantin' to
          bother, they'd lay low when anybody visited the island. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;When it come to matin' with them toad-lookin' fishes,
          the Kanakys kind o' balked, but finally they larnt something
          as put a new face on the matter. Seems that human folks has
          got a kind a' relation to sech water-beasts - that
          everything alive come aout o' the water onct an' only needs
          a little change to go back agin. Them things told the
          Kanakys that ef they mixed bloods there'd be children as ud
          look human at fust, but later turn more'n more like the
          things, till finally they'd take to the water an' jine the
          main lot o' things daown har. An' this is the important
          part, young feller - them as turned into fish things an'
          went into the water wouldn't never die. Them things never
          died excep' they was kilt violent.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them
          islanders they was all full o' fish blood from them deep
          water things. When they got old an' begun to shew it, they
          was kep' hid until they felt like takin' to the water an'
          quittin' the place. Some was more teched than others, an'
          some never did change quite enough to take to the water; but
          mosily they turned out jest the way them things said. Them
          as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as
          was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they
          was past seventy, though they'd usually go daown under for
          trial trips afore that. Folks as had took to the water
          gen'rally come back a good deal to visit, so's a man ud
          often be a'talkin' to his own five-times-great-grandfather
          who'd left the dry land a couple o' hundred years or so
          afore. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Everybody got aout o' the idee o' dyin' - excep' in
          canoe wars with the other islanders, or as sacrifices to the
          sea-gods daown below, or from snakebite or plague or sharp
          gallopin' ailments or somethin' afore they cud take to the
          water - but simply looked forrad to a kind o' change that
          wa'n't a bit horrible artet a while. They thought what
          they'd got was well wuth all they'd had to give up - an' I
          guess Obed kind o' come to think the same hisself when he'd
          chewed over old Walakea's story a bit. Walakea, though, was
          one of the few as hadn't got none of the fish blood - bein'
          of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other
          islands. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Walakea he shewed Obed a lot o' rites an'
          incantations as had to do with the sea things, an' let him
          see some o' the folks in the village as had changed a lot
          from human shape. Somehaow or other, though, he never would
          let him see one of the reg'lar things from right aout o' the
          water. In the end he give him a funny kind o' thingumajig
          made aout o' lead or something, that he said ud bring up the
          fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a
          nest o' 'em. The idee was to drop it daown with the right
          kind o' prayers an' sech. Walakea allowed as the things was
          scattered all over the world, so's anybody that looked
          abaout cud find a nest an' bring 'em up ef they was
          wanted. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Matt he didn't like this business at all, an' wanted
          Obed shud keep away from the island; but the Cap'n was sharp
          fer gain, an' faound he cud get them gold-like things so
          cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of them. Things went
          on that way for years an' Obed got enough o' that gold-like
          stuff to make him start the refinery in Waite's old
          run-daown fullin' mill. He didn't dass sell the pieces like
          they was, for folks ud be all the time askin' questions. All
          the same his crews ud get a piece an' dispose of it naow and
          then, even though they was swore to keep quiet; an' he let
          his women-folks wear some o' the pieces as was more
          human-like than most. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Well, come abaout thutty-eight - when I was seven
          year' old - Obed he faound the island people all wiped aout
          between v'yages. Seems the other islanders had got wind o'
          what was goin' on, and had took matters into their own
          hands.  S'pose they must a had, after all, them old magic
          signs as the sea things says was the only things they was
          afeard of. No tellin' what any o' them Kanakys will chance
          to git a holt of when the sea-bottom throws up some island
          with ruins older'n the deluge. Pious cusses, these was -
          they didn't leave nothin' standin' on either the main island
          or the little volcanic islet excep' what parts of the ruins
          was too big to knock daown. In some places they was little
          stones strewed abaout - like charms - with somethin' on 'em
          like what ye call a swastika naowadays.  Prob'ly them was
          the Old Ones' signs. Folks all wiped aout no trace o' no
          gold-like things an' none the nearby Kanakys ud breathe a
          word abaout the matter. Wouldn't even admit they'd ever ben
          any people on that island. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That naturally hit Obed pretty hard, seein' as his
          normal trade was doin' very poor.  It hit the whole of
          Innsmouth, too, because in seafarint days what profited the
          master of a ship gen'lly profited the crew
          proportionate. Most of the folks araound the taown took the
          hard times kind o' sheep-like an' resigned, but they was in
          bad shape because the fishin' was peterin' aout an' the
          mills wan't doin' none too well. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Then's the time Obed he begun a-cursin' at the folks
          fer bein' dull sheep an' prayin' to a Christian heaven as
          didn't help 'em none. He told 'em he'd knowed o' folks as
          prayed to gods that give somethin' ye reely need, an' says
          ef a good bunch o' men ud stand by him, he cud mebbe get a
          holt o' sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o' fish an' quite
          a bit of gold. 0' course them as sarved on the Sumatry
          Queen, an' seed the island knowed what he meant, an' wa'n't
          none too anxious to get clost to sea-things like they'd
          heard tell on, but them as didn't know what 'twas all abaout
          got kind o' swayed by what Obed had to say, and begun to ast
          him what he cud do to sit 'em on the way to the faith as ud
          bring 'em results.&quot;
          </p>
 
        <p>Here the old man faltered, mumbled, and lapsed into a moody
          and apprehensive silence; glancing nervously over his
          shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the
          distant black reef. When I spoke to him he did not answer,
          so I knew I would have to let him finish the bottle. The
          insane yarn I was hearing interested me profoundly, for I
          fancied there was contained within it a sort of crude
          allegory based upon the strangeness of Innsmouth and
          elaborated by an imagination at once creative and full of
          scraps of exotic legend. Not for a moment did I believe that
          the tale had any really substantial foundation; but none the
          less the account held a hint of genuine terror if only
          because it brought in references to strange jewels clearly
          akin to the malign tiara I had seen at Newburyport.  Perhaps
          the ornaments had, after all, come from some strange island;
          and possibly the wild stories were lies of the bygone Obed
          himself rather than of this antique toper. </p>
 
        <p>I handed Zadok the bottle, and he drained it to the last
          drop. It was curious how he could stand so much whiskey, for
          not even a trace of thickness had come into his high, wheezy
          voice. He licked the nose of the bottle and slipped it into
          his pocket, then beginning to nod and whisper softly to
          himself.  I bent close to catch any articulate words he
          might utter, and thought I saw a sardonic smile behind the
          stained bushy whiskers. Yes - he was really forming words,
          and I could grasp a fair proportion of them. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Poor Matt - Matt he allus was agin it - tried to line
          up the folks on his side, an' had long talks with the
          preachers - no use - they run the Congregational parson aout
          o' taown, an' the Methodist feller quit - never did see
          Resolved Babcock, the Baptist parson, agin - Wrath 0' Jehovy
          - I was a mightly little critter, but I heerd what I heerd
          an, seen what I seen - Dagon an' Ashtoreth - Belial an'
          Beelzebub - Golden Caff an' the idols o' Canaan an' the
          Philistines - Babylonish abominations - Mene, mene, tekel,
          upharisn - -.&quot;
          </p>
 
        <p>He stopped again, and from the look in his watery blue eyes
          I feared he was close to a stupor after all. But when I
          gently shook his shoulder he turned on me with astonishing
          alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Dun't believe me, hey? Hey, heh, heh - then jest tell
          me, young feller, why Cap'n Obed an' twenty odd other folks
          used to row aout to Devil Reef in the dead o' night an'
          chant things so laoud ye cud hear 'em all over taown when
          the wind was right? Tell me that, hey? An' tell me why Obed
          was allus droppin' heavy things daown into the deep water
          t'other side o' the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a
          cliff lower'n ye kin saound?  Tell me what he done with that
          funny-shaped lead thingumajig as Walakea give him? Hey, boy?
          An' what did they all haowl on May-Eve, an, agin the next
          Hallowe'en? An' why'd the new church parsons - fellers as
          used to he sailors - wear them queer robes an' cover
          their-selves with them gold-like things Obed brung?
          Hey?&quot;
          </p>
 
        <p>The watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now,
          and the dirty white beard bristled electrically. Old Zadok
          probably saw me shrink back, for he began to cackle
          evilly. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Heh, heh, heh, heh! Beginni'n to see hey? Mebbe ye'd
          like to a ben me in them days, when I seed things at night
          aout to sea from the cupalo top o' my haouse.  Oh, I kin
          tell ye' little pitchers hev big ears, an' I wa'n't missin'
          nothin' o' what was gossiped abaout Cap'n Obed an' the folks
          aout to the reef! Heh, heh, heh! Haow abaout the night I
          took my pa's ship's glass up to the cupalo an' seed the reef
          a-bristlin' thick with shapes that dove off quick soon's the
          moon riz? </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Obed an' the folks was in a dory, but them shapes
          dove off the far side into the deep water an' never come up
          ... </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Haow'd ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a
          cupola a-watchin' shapes as wa'n't human shapes? ...Heh?
          ... Heh, heh, heh ...&quot; </p>
 
        <p>The old man was getting hysterical, and I began to shiver
          with a nameless alarm. He laid a gnarled claw on my
          shoulder, and it seemed to me that its shaking was not
          altogether that of mirth. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;S'pose one night ye seed somethin' heavy heaved offen
          Obed's dory beyond the reef' and then learned next day a
          young feller was missin' from home. Hey! Did anybody ever
          see hide or hair o' Hiram Gilman agin. Did they? An' Nick
          Pierce, an' Luelly Waite, an' Adoniram Saouthwick, an' Henry
          Garrison Hey? Heh, heh, heh, heh ... Shapes talkin' sign
          language with their hands ... them as had reel hands
          ... </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Wal, Sir, that was the time Obed begun to git on his
          feet agin. Folks see his three darters a-wearin' gold-like
          things as nobody'd never see on 'em afore, an' smoke stared
          comin' aout o' the refin'ry chimbly. Other folks was
          prosp'rin, too - fish begun to swarm into the harbour fit to
          kill' an' heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to ship
          aout to Newb'ryport, Arkham, an' Boston. T'was then Obed got
          the ol' branch railrud put through.  Some Kingsport
          fishermen heerd abaout the ketch an' come up in sloops, but
          they was all lost. Nobody never see 'em agin. An' jest then
          our folk organised the Esoteric Order 0' Dagon, an' bought
          Masoic Hall offen Calvary Commandery for it ... heh, heh,
          heh! Matt Eliot was a Mason an' agin the sellin', but he
          dropped aout o' sight jest then. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Remember, I ain't sayin' Obed was set on hevin'
          things jest like they was on that Kanaky isle. I dun't think
          he aimed at fust to do no mixin', nor raise no younguns to
          take to the water an' turn into fishes with eternal life. He
          wanted them gold things, an' was willin' to pay heavy, an' I
          guess the others was satisfied fer a while ... </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Come in' forty-six the taown done some lookin' an'
          thinkin' fer itself. Too many folks missin' - too much wild
          preachin' at meetin' of a Sunday - too much talk abaout that
          reef. I guess I done a bit by tellin' Selectman Mowry what I
          see from the cupalo. They was a party one night as follered
          Obed's craowd aout to the reef, an' I heerd shots betwixt
          the dories. Nex' day Obed and thutty-two others was in gaol,
          with everybody a-wonderin' jest what was afoot and jest what
          charge agin 'em cud he got to holt.  God, ef anybody'd
          look'd ahead ... a couple o' weeks later, when nothin' had
          ben throwed into the sea fer thet long ... </p>
 
        <p>Zadok was shewing sings of fright and exhaustion, and I let
          him keep silence for a while, though glancing apprehensively
          at my watch. The tide had turned and was coming in now, and
          the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him.  I was glad of
          that tide, for at high water the fishy smell might not be so
          bad. Again I strained to catch his whispers. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;That awful night ... I seed 'em. I was up in the
          cupalo ... hordes of 'em ... swarms of 'em ... all over the
          reef an' swimmin' up the harbour into the Manuxet ... God,
          what happened in the streets of Innsmouth that night
          ... they rattled our door, but pa wouldn't open ... then he
          clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find
          Selecman Mowry an' see what he cud do ... Maounds o' the
          dead an' the dyin' ... shots and screams ... shaoutin' in Ol
          Squar an' Taown Squar an' New Church Green - gaol throwed
          open ... - proclamation ... treason ... called it the plague
          when folks come in an' faoud haff our people missin'
          ... nobody left but them as ud jine in with Obed an' them
          things or else keep quiet ... never heard o' my pa no
          more... &quot; </p>
 
        <p>The old man was panting and perspiring profusely. His grip
          on my shoulder tightened.
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Everything cleaned up in the mornin' - but they was
          traces ... Obed he kinder takes charge an' says things is
          goin' to be changed ... others'll worship with us at
          meetin'-time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertin guests
          ... they wanted to mix like they done with the Kanakys, an'
          he for one didn't feel baound to stop 'em. Far gone, was
          Obed ... jest like a crazy man on the subjeck. He says they
          brung us fish an' treasure, an' shud hev what they hankered
          after ...&quot; </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Nothin' was to be diff'runt on the aoutsid; only we
          was to keep shy o' strangers ef we knowed what was good fer
          us. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;We all hed to take the Oath o' Dagon, an' later on
          they was secon' an' third oaths that some o' us took. Them
          as ud help special, ud git special rewards - gold an' sech -
          No use balkin', fer they was millions of 'em daown thar.
          They'd ruther not start risin' an' wipin' aout human-kind,
          but ef they was gave away an' forced to, they cud do a lot
          toward jest that. We didn't hev them old charms to cut 'em
          off like folks in the Saouth Sea did, an' them Kanakys
          wudu't never give away their secrets. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Yield up enough sacrifices an' savage knick-knacks
          an' harbourage in the taown when they wanted it, an' they'd
          let well enough alone. Wudn't bother no strangers as might
          bear tales aoutside - that is, withaout they got pryin'. All
          in the band of the faithful - Order 0' Dagon - an' the
          children shud never die, but go back to the Mother Hydra an'
          Father Dagon what we all come from onct ... Ia! Ia! Cthulhu
          fhtagn!  Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga
          - &quot; </p>
 
        <p>Old Zadok was fast lapsing into stark raving, and I held my
          breath. Poor old soul - to what pitiful depths of
          hallucination had his liquor, plus his hatred of the decay,
          alienage, and disease around him, brought that fertile,
          imaginative brain? He began to moan now, and tears were
          coursing down his channelled checks into the depths of his
          beard. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;God, what I seen senct I was fifteen year' old -
          Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin! - the folks as was missin', and
          them as kilt theirselves - them as told things in Arkham or
          Ipswich or sech places was all called crazy, like you're
          callin' me right naow - but God, what I seen - They'd a kilt
          me long ago fer' what I know, only I'd took the fust an'
          secon' Oaths o' Dago offen Obed, so was pertected unlessen a
          jury of 'em proved I told things knowin' an' delib'rit
          ... but I wudn't take the third Oath - I'd a died ruther'n
          take that - </p>
 
        <p>&quot;It got wuss araound Civil War time, when children
          born senct 'forty-six begun to grow up - some 'em, that
          is. I was afeared - never did no pryin' arter that awful
          night, an' never see one o' - them - clost to in all my
          life.  That is, never no full-blooded one. I went to the
          war, an' ef I'd a had any guts or sense I'd a never come
          back, but settled away from here.  But folks wrote me things
          wa'n't so bad. That, I s'pose, was because gov'munt draft
          men was in taown arter 'sixty-three. Arter the war it was
          jest as bad agin. People begun to fall off - mills an' shops
          shet daown - shippin' stopped an' the harbour choked up -
          railrud give up - but they ... they never stopped swimmin'
          in an' aout o' the river from that cursed reef o' Satan -
          an' more an' more attic winders got a-boarded up, an' more
          an' more noises was heerd in haouses as wa'n't s'posed to
          hev nobody in 'em... </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Folks aoutside hev their stories abaout us - s'pose
          you've heerd a plenty on 'em, seein' what questions ye ast -
          stories abaout things they've seed naow an' then, an' abaout
          that queer joolry as still comes in from somewhars an' ain't
          quite all melted up - but nothin' never gits
          def'nite. Nobody'll believe nothin'. They call them
          gold-like things pirate loot, an' allaow the Innsmouth folks
          hez furren blood or is dis-tempered or somethin'.  Beside,
          them that lives here shoo off as many strangers as they kin,
          an' encourage the rest not to git very cur'ous, specially
          raound night time. Beasts balk at the critters - hosses
          wuss'n mules - but when they got autos that was all
          right. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;In 'forty-six Cap'n Obed took a second wife that
          nobody in the taown never see - some says he didn't want to,
          but was made to by them as he'd called in - had three
          children by her - two as disappeared young, but one gal as
          looked like anybody else an' was eddicated in Europe. Obed
          finally got her married off by a trick to an Arkham feller
          as didn't suspect nothin'. But nobody aoutside'll hav
          nothin' to do with Innsmouth folks naow. Barnabas Marsh that
          runs the refin'ry now is Obed's grandson by his fust wife -
          son of Onesiphorus, his eldest son, but his mother was
          another o' them as wa'n't never seen aoutdoors. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Right naow Barnabas is abaout changed. Can't shet his
          eyes no more, an' is all aout o' shape.  They say he still
          wears clothes, but he'll take to the water soon. Mebbe he's
          tried it already - they do sometimes go daown for little
          spells afore they go daown for good. Ain't ben seed abaout
          in public fer nigh on ten year'. Dun't know haow his poor
          wife kin feel - she come from Ipiwich, an' they nigh lynched
          Barnabas when he courted her fifty odd year' ago. Obed he
          died in 'seventy-eight an' all the next gen'ration is gone
          naow - the fust wife's children dead, and the rest ... God
          knows ...&quot; </p>
 
        <p>The sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent, and
          little by little it seemed to change the old man's mood from
          maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear.  He would pause now
          and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or
          out toward the reef, and despite the wild absurdity of his
          tale, I could not help beginning to share his
          apprehensiveness. Zadok now grew shriller, seemed to be
          trying to whip up his courage with louder speech. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Hey, yew, why dun't ye say somethin'? Haow'd ye like
          to he livin' in a taown like this, with everything a-rottin'
          an' dyin', an' boarded-up monsters crawlin' an' bleatin' an'
          barkin' an' hoppin' araoun' black cellars an' attics every
          way ye turn? Hey? Haow'd ye like to hear the haowlin' night
          arter night from the churches an' Order 0' Dagon Hall, an'
          know what's doin' part o' the haowlin'? Haow'd ye like to
          hear what comes from that awful reef every May-Eve an'
          Hallowmass? Hey? Think the old man's crazy, eh?  Wal, Sir,
          let me tell ye that ain't the wust!&quot; </p>
 
        <p>Zadok was really screaming now, and the mad frenzy of his
          voice disturbed me more than I care to own. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Curse ye, dun't set thar a'starin' at me with them
          eyes - I tell Obed Marsh he's in hell, an, hez got to stay
          thar!  Heh, heh ... in hell, I says! Can't git me - I hain't
          done nothin' nor told nobody nothin' - - </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Oh, you, young feller? Wal, even ef I hain't told
          nobody nothin' yet, I'm a'goin' to naow! Yew jest set still
          an' listen to me, boy - this is what I ain't never told
          nobody... I says I didn't get to do pryin' arter that night
          - but I faound things about jest the same!&quot; </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Yew want to know what the reel horror is, hey? Wal,
          it's this - it ain't what them fish devils hez done, but
          what they're a-goin' to do! They're a-bringin' things up
          aout o' whar they come from into the taown - been doin' it
          fer years, an' slackenin' up lately. Them haouses north o'
          the river be-twixt Water an' Main Streets is full of 'em -
          them devils an' what they brung - an' when they git ready
          ... I say, when they git... ever hear tell of a shoggoth?
          </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Hey, d'ye hear me? I tell ye I know what them things
          be - I seen 'em one night when ... eh-ahhh-ah! e'yahhh
          ... &quot; </p>
 
        <p>The hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old
          man's shriek almost made me faint.  His eyes, looking past
          me toward the malodorous sea, were positively starting from
          his head; while his face was a mask of fear worthy of Greek
          tragedy. His bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder, and
          he made no motion as I turned my head to look at whatever he
          had glimpsed.
          </p>
 
        <p>There was nothing that I could see. Only the incoming tide,
          with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the
          long-flung line of breakers. But now Zadok was shaking me,
          and I turned back to watch the melting of that fear-frozen
          face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling
          gums. Presently his voice came back - albeit as a trembling
          whisper. </p>
 
        <p>&quot;Git aout o' here!  Get aout o' here! They seen us -
          git aout fer your life! Dun't wait fer nothin' - they know
          naow - Run fer it - quick - aout o' this taown - -&quot;
          </p>
 
        <p>Another heavy wave dashed against the loosing masonry of
          the bygone wharf, and changed the mad ancient's whisper to
          another inhuman and blood-curdling scream.  &quot;E-yaahhhh!
          ... Yheaaaaaa!...&quot; </p>
 
        <p>Before I could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his
          clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the
          street, reeling northward around the ruined warehouse
          wall. </p>
 
        <p>I glanced back at the sea, but there was nothing there. And
          when I reached Water Street and looked along it toward the
          north there was no remaining trace of Zadok Allen. </p>
 
        <h4 align="center">IV</h4>

        <p>I can hardly describe the mood in which I was left by this
          harrowing episode - an episode at once mad and pitiful,
          grotesque and terrifying. The grocery boy had prepared me
          for it, yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and
          disturbed. Puerile though the story was, old Zadok's insane
          earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting
          unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for
          the town and its blight of intangible shadow. </p>
 
        <p>Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of
          historic allegory; just now I wished to put it out of my
          head. The hour grown perilously late - my watch said 7:15,
          and the Arkham bus left Town Square at eight - so I tried to
          give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as
          possible, meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted
          streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel
          where I had checked my valise and would find my bus. </p>
 
        <p>Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient
          roofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and
          peace, I could not help glancing over my shoulder now and
          then. I would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous
          and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and wished there were some
          other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinister-looking
          fellow Sargent.  Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for
          there were architectural details worth viewing at every
          silent corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the
          necessary distance in a half-hour. </p>
 
        <p>Studying the grocery youth's map and seeking a route I had
          not traversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State
          for my approach to Town Square. Near the corner of Fall
          street I began to see scattered groups of furtive
          whisperers, and when I finally reached the Square I saw that
          almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of
          the Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, watery,
          unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in
          the lobby, and I hoped that none of these unpleasant
          creatures would be my fellow-passengers on the coach. </p>
 
        <p>The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers
          somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the
          sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the
          driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of
          newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers -
          the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that
          morning - shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint
          guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have
          sworn was not English. I boarded the empty coach and took
          the seat I had taken before, but was hardly settled before
          Sargent re-appeared and began mumbling in a throaty voice of
          peculiar repulsiveness. </p>
 
        <p>I was, it appeared, in very bad luck. There had been
          something wrong with the engine, despite the excellent time
          made from Newburyport, and the bus could not complete the
          journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired
          that night, nor was there any other way of getting
          transportation out of Innsmouth either to Arkham or
          elsewhere. Sargent was sorry, but I would have to stop over
          at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make the price easy
          for me, but there was nothing else to do. Almost dazed by
          this sudden obstacle, and violently dreading the fall of
          night in this decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the
          bus and reentered the hotel lobby; where the sullen
          queer-looking night clerk told me I could have Room 428 on
          next the top floor - large, but without running water - for
          a dollar. </p>
 
        <p>Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I
          signed the register, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my
          valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three
          creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed
          wholly devoid of life. My room was a dismal rear one with
          two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy
          court-yard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick
          blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward-stretching
          roofs with a marshy countryside beyond. At the end of the
          corridor was a bathroom - a discouraging relique with
          ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and
          musty wooded paneling around all the plumbing fixtures. </p>
 
        <p>It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and
          looked around for a dinner of some sort; noticing as I did
          so the strange glances I received from the unwholesome
          loafers. Since the grocery was closed, I was forced to
          patronise the restaurant I had shunned before; a stooped,
          narrow-headed man with staring, unwinking eyes, and a
          flat-nosed wench with unbelievably thick, clumsy hands being
          in attendance. The service was all of the counter type, and
          it relieved me to find that much was evidently served from
          cans and packages. A bowl of vegetable soup with crackers
          was enough for me, and I soon headed back for my cheerless
          room at the Gilman; getting a evening paper and a
          fly-specked magazine from the evil-visaged clerk at the
          rickety stand beside his desk. </p>
 
        <p>As twilight deepened I turned on the one feeble electric
          bulb over the cheap, iron-framed bed, and tried as best I
          could to continue the reading I had begun.  I felt it
          advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied, for it would
          not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient,
          blight-shadowed town while I was still within its
          borders. The insane yarn I had heard from the aged drunkard
          did not promise very pleasant dreams, and I felt I must keep
          the image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from
          my imagination. </p>
 
        <p>Also, I must not dwell on what that factory inspector had
          told the Newburyport ticket-agent about the Gilman House and
          the voices of its nocturnal tenants - not on that, nor on
          the face beneath the tiara in the black church doorway; the
          face for whose horror my conscious mind could not
          account. It would perhaps have been easier to keep my
          thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so
          gruesomely musty. As it was, the lethal mustiness blended
          hideously with the town's general fishy odour and
          persistently focussed one's fancy on death and decay. </p>
 
        <p>Another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt
          on the door of my room. One had been there, as marks clearly
          shewed, but there were signs of recent removal. No doubt it
          had been out of order, like so many other things in this
          decrepit edifice. In my nervousness I looked around and
          discovered a bolt on the clothes press which seemed to be of
          the same size, judging from the marks, as the one formerly
          on the door. To gain a partial relief from the general
          tension I busied myself by transferring this hardware to the
          vacant place with the aid of a handy three-in-one device
          including a screwdriver which I kept on my key-ring. The
          bolt fitted perfectly, and I was somewhat relieved when I
          knew that I could shoot it firmly upon retiring. Not that I
          had any real apprehension of its need, but that any symbol
          of security was welcome in an environment of this kind.
          There were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to
          connecting rooms, and these I proceeded to fasten. </p>
 
        <p>I did not undress, but decided to read till I was sleepy
          and then lie down with only my coat, collar, and shoes
          off. Taking a pocket flash light from my valise, I placed it
          in my trousers, so that I could read my watch if I woke up
          later in the dark. Drowsiness, however, did not come; and
          when I stopped to analyse my thoughts I found to my disquiet
          that I was really unconsciously listening for something -
          listening for something which I dreaded but could not
          name. That inspector's story must have worked on my
          imagination more deeply than I had suspected. Again I tried
          to read, but found that I made no progress. </p>
 
        <p>After a time I seemed to hear the stairs and corridors
          creak at intervals as if with footsteps, and wondered if the
          other rooms were beginning to fill up. There were no voices,
          however, and it struck me that there was something subtly
          furtive about the creaking. I did not like it, and debated
          whether I had better try to sleep at all. This town had some
          queer people, and there had undoubtedly been several
          disappearances. Was this one of those inns where travelers
          were slain for their money? Surely I had no look of
          excessive prosperity. Or were the towns folk really so
          resentful about curious visitors? Had my obvious
          sightseeing, with its frequent map-consultations, aroused
          unfavorable notice. It occurred to me that I must be in a
          highly nervous state to let a few random creakings set me
          off speculating in this fashion - but I regretted none the
          less that I was unarmed. </p>
 
        <p>At length, feeling a fatigue which had nothing of
          drowsiness in it, I bolted the newly outfitted hall door,
          turned off the light, and threw myself down on the hard,
          uneven bed - coat, collar, shoes, and all. In the darkness
          every faint noise of the night seemed magnified, and a flood
          of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me. I was sorry I
          had put out the light, yet was too tired to rise and turn it
          on again. Then, after a long, dreary interval, and prefaced
          by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor, there came that
          soft, damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign
          fulfillment of all my apprehensions. Without the least
          shadow of a doubt, the lock of my door was being tried -
          cautiously, furtively, tentatively - with a key. </p>
 
        <p>My sensations upon recognising this sign of actual peril
          were perhaps less rather than more tumultuous because of my
          previous vague fears. I had been, albeit without definite
          reason, instinctively on my guard - and that was to my
          advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it might turn
          out to be. Nevertheless the change in the menace from vague
          premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock, and
          fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow. It never once
          occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere
          mistake. Malign purpose was all I could think of, and I kept
          deathly quiet, awaiting the would-be intruder's next
          move. </p>
 
        <p>After a time the cautious rattling ceased, and I heard the
          room to the north entered with a pass key. Then the lock of
          the connecting door to my room was softly tried. The bolt
          held, of course, and I heard the floor creak as the prowler
          left the room. After a moment there came another soft
          rattling, and I knew that the room to the south of me was
          being entered.  Again a furtive trying of a bolted
          connecting door, and again a receding creaking. This time
          the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I
          knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of
          my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or
          lesser time, as the future would shew. </p>
 
        <p>The readiness with which I fell into a plan of action
          proves that I must have been subconsciously fearing some
          menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours.
          From the first I felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger
          not to be met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as
          precipitately as possible.  The one thing to do was to get
          out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through
          some channel other than the front stairs and lobby.
          </p>
 
        <p>Rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch, I
          sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and
          pocket some belongings for a swift, valiseless
          flight. Nothing, however, happened; and I saw that the power
          had been cut off. Clearly, some cryptic, evil movement was
          afoot on a large scale - just what, I could not say. As I
          stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch I
          heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I
          could barely distinguish voices in conversation. A moment
          later I felt less sure that the deeper sounds were voices,
          since the apparent hoarse barkings and loose-syllabled
          croakings bore so little resemblance to recognized human
          speech. Then I thought with renewed force of what the
          factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering
          and pestilential building. </p>
 
        <p>Having filled my pockets with the flashlight's aid, I put
          on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of
          descent. Despite the state's safety regulations there was no
          fire escape on this side of the hotel, and I saw that my
          windows commanded only a sheer three story drop to the
          cobbled courtyard.  On the right and left, however, some
          ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel; their
          slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from
          my fourth-story level. To reach either of these lines of
          buildings I would have to be in a room two from my own - in
          one case on the north and in the other case on the south -
          and my mind instantly set to work what chances I had of
          making the transfer. </p>
 
        <p>I could not, I decided, risk an emergence into the
          corridor; where my footsteps would surely be heard, and
          where the difficulties of entering the desired room would be
          insuperable. My progress, if it was to be made at all, would
          have to be through the less solidly-built connecting doors
          of the rooms; the locks and bolts of which I would have to
          force violently, using my shoulder as a battering-ram
          whenever they were set against me. This, I thought, would be
          possible owing to the rickety nature of the house and its
          fixtures; but I realised I could not do it noiselessly. I
          would have to count on sheer speed, and the chance of
          getting to a window before any hostile forces became
          coordinated enough to open the right door toward me with a
          pass-key. My own outer door I reinforced by pushing the
          bureau against it - little by little, in order to make a
          minimum of sound. </p>
 
        <p>I perceived that my chances were very slender, and was
          fully prepared for any calamity.  Even getting to another
          roof would not solve the problem for there would then remain
          the task of reaching the ground and escaping from the town.
          One thing in my favour was the deserted and ruinous state of
          the abutting building and the number of skylights gaping
          blackly open in each row.
          </p>
 
        <p>Gathering from the grocery boy's map that the best route
          out of town was southward, I glanced first at the connecting
          door on the south side of the room. It was designed to open
          in my direction, hence I saw - after drawing the bolt and
          finding other fastening in place - it was not a favorable
          one for forcing. Accordingly abandoning it as a route, I
          cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any
          attack which might be made on it later from the next room.
          The door on the north was hung to open away from me, and
          this - though a test proved it to be locked or bolted from
          the other side - I knew must be my route. If I could gain
          the roofs of the buildings in Paine Street and descend
          successfully to the ground level, I might perhaps dart
          through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite building
          to Washington or Bates - or else emerge in Paine and edge
          around southward into Washington. In any case, I would aim
          to strike Washington somehow and get quickly out of the Town
          Square region. My preference would be to avoid Paine, since
          the fire station there might be open all night.
          </p>
 
        <p>As I thought of these things I looked out over the squalid
          sea of decaying roofs below me, now brightened by the beams
          of a moon not much past full. On the right the black gash of
          the river-gorge clove the panorama; abandoned factories and
          railway station clinging barnacle-like to its sides. Beyond
          it the rusted railway and the Rowley road led off through a
          flat marshy terrain dotted with islets of higher and dryer
          scrub-grown land. On the left the creek-threaded
          country-side was nearer, the narrow road to Ipswich gleaming
          white in the moonlight. I could not see from my side of the
          hotel the southward route toward Arkham which I had
          determined to take. </p>
 
        <p>I was irresolutely speculating on when I had better attack
          the northward door, and on how I could least audibly manage
          it, when I noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given
          place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs.  A
          wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom, and the
          boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous
          load. Muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached,
          and at length a firm knock came at my outer door. </p>
 
        <p>For a moment I simply held my breath and waited. Eternities
          seemed to elapse, and the nauseous fishy odour of my
          environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly.
          Then the knocking was repeated - continuously, and with
          growing insistence.  I knew that the time for action had
          come, and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward
          connecting door, bracing myself for the task of battering it
          open. The knocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its volume
          would cover the sound of my efforts. At last beginning my
          attempt, I lunged again and again at the thin paneling with
          my left shoulder, heedless of shock or pain. The door
          resisted even more than I expected, but I did not give
          in. And all the while the clamour at the outer door
          increased.
          </p>
 
        <p>Finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash
          that I knew those outside must have heard. Instantly the
          outside knocking became a violent battering, while keys
          sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both
          sides of me. Rushing through the newly opened connexion, I
          succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock
          could he turned; but even as I did so I heard the hall door
          of the third room - the one from whose window I had hoped to
          reach the roof below - being tried with a pass key. </p>
 
        <p>For an instant I felt absolute despair, since my trapping
          in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete. A wave
          of almost abnormal horror swept over me, and invested with a
          terrible but unexplainable singularity the
          flashlight-glimpsed dust prints made by the intruder who had
          lately tried my door from this room. Then, with a dazed
          automatism which persisted despite hopelessness, I made for
          the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of
          pushing at it in an effort to get through and - granting
          that fastenings might be as providentially intact as in this
          second room - bolt the hall door beyond before the lock
          could be turned from outside. </p>
 
        <p>Sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprieve - for the
          connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually
          ajar. In a second I was though, and had my right knee and
          shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening
          inward. My pressure took the opener off guard, for the thing
          shut as I pushed, so that I could slip the well-conditioned
          bolt as I had done with the other door. As I gained this
          respite I heard the battering at the two other doors abate,
          while a confused clatter came from the connecting door I had
          shielded with the bedstead. Evidently the bulk of my
          assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing
          in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass key
          sounded in the next door to the north, and I knew that a
          nearer peril was at hand. </p>
 
        <p>The northward connecting door was wide open, but there was
          no time to think about checking the already turning lock in
          the hall. All I could do was to shut and bolt the open
          connecting door, as well as its mate on the opposite side -
          pushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the
          other, and moving a washstand in front of the hall door. I
          must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me
          till I could get out the window and on the roof of the Paine
          Street block. But even in this acute moment my chief horror
          was something apart from the immediate weakness of my
          defenses. I was shuddering because not one of my pursuers,
          despite some hideous panting, grunting, and subdued barkings
          at odd intervals, was uttering an unmuffled or intelligible
          vocal sound. </p>
 
        <p>As I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I
          heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the
          room north of me, and perceived that the southward battering
          had ceased. Plainly, most of my opponents were about to
          concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they
          knew must open directly on me. Outside, the moon played on
          the ridgepole of the block below, and I saw that the jump
          would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface
          on which I must land. </p>
 
        <p>Surveying the conditions, I chose the more southerly of the
          two windows as my avenue of escape; planning to land on the
          inner slope of the roof and make for the nearest
          sky-light. Once inside one of the decrepit brick structures
          I would have to reckon with pursuit; but I hoped to descend
          and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed
          courtyard, eventually getting to Washington Street and
          slipping out of town toward the south. </p>
 
        <p>The clatter at the northerly connecting door was now
          terrific, and I saw that the weak panelling was beginning to
          splinter. Obviously, the besiegers had brought some
          ponderous object into play as a battering-ram. The bedstead,
          however, still held firm; so that I had at least a faint
          chance of making good my escape. As I opened the window I
          noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies
          suspended from a pole by brass rings, and also that there
          was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the
          exterior.  Seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous
          jump, I yanked at the hangings and brought them down, pole
          and all; then quickly hooking two of the rings in the
          shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside.  The heavy
          folds reached fully to the abutting roof, and I saw that the
          rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight. So,
          climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope
          ladder, I left behind me forever the morbid and
          horror-infested fabric of the Gilman House. </p>
 
        <p>I landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof, and
          succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a
          slip. Glancing up at the window I had left, I observed it
          was still dark, though far across the crumbling chimneys to
          the north I could see lights ominously blazing in the Order
          of Dagon Hall, the Baptist church, and the Congregational
          church which I recalled so shiveringly. There had seemed to
          be no one in the courtyard below, and I hoped there would be
          a chance to get away before the spreading of a general
          alarm. Flashing my pocket lamp into the skylight, I saw that
          there were no steps down. The distance was slight, however,
          so I clambered over the brink and dropped; striking a dusty
          floor littered with crumbling boxes and barrels. </p>
 
        <p>The place was ghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such
          impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by
          my flashlight - after a hasty glance at my watch, which
          shewed the hour to be 2 a.m. The steps creaked, but seemed
          tolerably sound; and I raced down past a barnlike second
          storey to the ground floor. The desolation was complete, and
          only echoes answered my footfalls.  At length I reached the
          lower hall at the end of which I saw a faint luminous
          rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway. Heading
          the other way, I found the back door also open; and darted
          out and down five stone steps to the grass-grown
          cobblestones of the courtyard. </p>
 
        <p>The moonbeams did not reach down here, but I could just see
          my way about without using the flashlight. Some of the
          windows on the Gilman House side were faintly glowing, and I
          thought I heard confused sounds within. Walking softly over
          to the Washington Street side I perceived several open
          doorways, and chose the nearest as my route out. The hallway
          inside was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw
          that the street door was wedged immovably shut. Resolved to
          try another building, I groped my way back toward the
          courtyard, but stopped short when close to the doorway. </p>
 
        <p>For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd
          of doubtful shapes was pouring - lanterns bobbing in the
          darkness, and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries
          in what was certainly not English. The figures moved
          uncertainly, and I realized to my relief that they did not
          know where I had gone; but for all that they sent a shiver
          of horror through my frame. Their features were
          indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling gait was
          abominably repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one
          figure was strangely robed, and unmistakably surmounted by a
          tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar. As the
          figures spread throughout the courtyard, I felt my fears
          increase. Suppose I could find no egress from this building
          on the street side? The fishy odour was detestable, and I
          wondered I could stand it without fainting. Again groping
          toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came
          upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless
          windows. Fumbling in the rays of my flashlight, I found I
          could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed
          outside and was fully closing the aperture in its original
          manner. </p>
 
        <p>I was now in Washington Street, and for the moment saw no
          living thing nor any light save that of the moon. From
          several directions in the distance, however, I could hear
          the sound of hoarse voices, of footsteps, and of a curious
          kind of pattering which did not sound quite like
          footsteps. Plainly I had no time to lose. The points of the
          compass were clear to me, and I was glad that all the street
          lights were turned off, as is often the custom on strongly
          moonlit nights in prosperous rural regions. Some of the
          sounds came from the south, yet I retained my design of
          escaping in that direction. There would, I knew, be plenty
          of deserted doorways to shelter me in case I met any person
          or group who looked like pursuers.
          </p>
 
        <p>I walked rapidly, softly, and close to the ruined
          houses. While hatless and dishevelled after my arduous
          climb, I did not look especially noticeable; and stood a
          good chance of passing unheeded if forced to encounter any
          casual wayfarer. </p>
 
        <p>At Bates Street I drew into a yawning vestibule while two
          shambling figures crossed in front of me, but was soon on my
          way again and approaching the open space where Eliot Street
          obliquely crosses Washington at the intersection of
          South. Though I had never seen this space, it had looked
          dangerous to me on the grocery youth's map; since the
          moonlight would have free play there. There was no use
          trying to evade it, for any alternative course would involve
          detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying
          effect. The only thing to do was to cross it boldly and
          openly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk
          as best I could, and trusting that no one - or at least no
          pursuer of mine - would be there. </p>
 
        <p>Just how fully the pursuit was organised - and indeed, just
          what its purpose might be - I could form no idea. There
          seemed to be unusual activity in the town, but I judged that
          the news of my escape from the Gilman had not yet spread. I
          would, of course, soon have to shift from Washington to some
          other southward street; for that party from the hotel would
          doubtless be after me. I must have left dust prints in that
          last old building, revealing how I had gained the
          street. </p>
 
        <p>The open space was, as I had expected, strongly moonlit;
          and I saw the remains of a parklike, iron-railed green in
          its center. Fortunately no one was about though a curious
          sort of buzz or roar seemed to be increasing in the
          direction of Town Square. South Street was very wide,
          leading directly down a slight declivity to the waterfront
          and commanding a long view out a sea; and I hoped that no
          one would be glancing up it from afar as I crossed in the
          bright moonlight. </p>
 
        <p>My progress was unimpeded, and no fresh sound arose to hint
          that I had been spied. Glancing about me, I involuntarily
          let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the
          sea, gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street's
          end. Far out beyond the breakwater was the dim, dark line of
          Devil Reef, and as I glimpsed it I could not help thinking
          of all the hideous legends I had heard in the last
          twenty-four hours - legends which portrayed this ragged rock
          as a veritable gateway to realms of unfathomed horror and
          inconceivable abnormality. </p>
 
        <p>Then, without warning, I saw the intermittent flashes of
          light on the distant reef. They were definite and
          unmistakable, and awaked in my mind a blind horror beyond
          all rational proportion. My muscles tightened for panic
          flight, held in only by a certain unconscious caution and
          half-hypnotic fascination.  And to make matters worse, there
          now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the Gilman House,
          which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a series of
          analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be
          nothing less than an answering signal. </p>
 
        <p>Controlling my muscles, and realising afresh - how plainly
          visible I was, I resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling
          pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous
          reef as long as the opening of South Street gave me a
          seaward view. What the whole proceeding meant, I could not
          imagine; unless it involved some strange rite connected with
          Devil Reef, or unless some party had landed from a ship on
          that sinister rock. I now bent to the left around the
          ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in
          the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical
          flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons. </p>
 
        <p>It was then that the most horrible impression of all was
          borne in upon me - the impression which destroyed my last
          vestige of self-control and sent me running frantically
          southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily
          staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. For at a
          closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef
          and the shore were far from empty. They were alive with a
          teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town; and
          even at my vast distance and in my single moment of
          perception I could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing
          arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be
          expressed or consciously formulated. </p>
 
        <p>My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for
          at my left I began to hear something like the hue and cry of
          organised pursuit. There were footsteps and gutteral sounds,
          and a rattling motor wheezed south along Federal Street. In
          a second all my plans were utterly changed - for if the
          southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I must clearly
          find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into a
          gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the
          moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the
          parallel street. </p>
 
        <p>A second reflection was less comforting. Since the pursuit
          was down another street, it was plain that the party was not
          following me directly. It had not seen me, but was simply
          obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape.  This,
          however, implied that all roads leading out of Innsmouth
          were similarly patrolled; for the people could not have
          known what route I intended to take. If this were so, I
          would have to make my retreat across country away from any
          road; but how could I do that in view of the marshy and
          creek-riddled nature of all the surrounding region? For a
          moment my brain reeled - both from sheer hopelessness and
          from a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odour. </p>
 
        <p>Then I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose
          solid line of ballasted, weed-grown earth still stretched
          off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge
          at the river-gorge. There was just a chance that the
          townsfolk would not think of that; since its briar-choked
          desertion made it half-impassable, and the unlikeliest of
          all avenues for a fugitive to choose. I had seen it clearly
          from my hotel window and knew about how it lay. Most of its
          earlier length was uncomfortably visible from the Rowley
          road, and from high places in the town itself; but one could
          perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth. At
          any rate, it would form my only chance of deliverance, and
          there was nothing to do but try it. </p>
 
        <p>Drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I once more
          consulted the grocery boy's map with the aid of the
          flashlight. The immediate problem was how to reach the
          ancient railway; and I now saw that the safest course was
          ahead to Babson Street; then west to Lafayette - there
          edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to
          the one I had traversed - and subsequently back northward
          and westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates,
          Adam, and Bank streets - the latter skirting the river gorge
          - to the abandoned and dilapidated station I had seen from
          my window. My reason for going ahead to Babson was that I
          wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to
          begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as
          South. </p>
 
        <p>Starting once more, I crossed the street to the right-hand
          side in order to edge around into Babeon as inconspicuously
          as possible. Noises still continued in Federal Street, and
          as I glanced behind me I thought I saw a gleam of light near
          the building through which I had escaped. Anxious to leave
          Washington Street, I broke into a quiet dogtrot, trusting to
          luck not to encounter any observing eye. Next the corner of
          Babson Street I saw to my alarm that one of the houses was
          still inhabited, as attested by curtains at the window; but
          there were no lights within, and I passed it without
          disaster. </p>
 
        <p>In Babson Street, which crossed Federal and might thus
          reveal me to the searchers, I clung as closely as possible
          to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway
          as the noises behind me momentarily increased. The open
          space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon, but my
          route would not force me to cross it. During my second pause
          I began to detect a fresh distribution of vague sounds; and
          upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car
          darting across the open space, bound outward along Eliot
          Street, which there intersects both Babson and Lafayette.
          </p>
 
        <p>As I watched - choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour
          after a short abatement - I saw a band of uncouth, crouching
          shapes loping and shambling in the same direction; and knew
          that this must be the party guarding the Ipswich road, since
          that highway forms an extension of Eliot Street. Two of the
          figures I glimpsed were in voluminous robes, and one wore a
          peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight. The
          gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through
          me - for it seemed to me the creature was almost
          hopping. </p>
 
        <p>When the last of the band was out of sight I resumed my
          progress; darting around the corner into Lafayette Street,
          and crossing Eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the
          party be still advancing along that thoroughfare.  I did
          hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward Town
          Square, but accomplished the passage without disaster. My
          greatest dread was in re-crossing broad and moonlit South
          Street - with its seaward view - and I had to nerve myself
          for the ordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and
          possible Eliot Street stragglers could not fail to glimpse
          me from either of two points. At the last moment I decided I
          had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before
          in the shambling gait of an average Innsmouth native. </p>
 
        <p>When the view of the water again opened out - this time on
          my right - I was half-determined not to look at it at all. I
          could not however, resist; but cast a sidelong glance as I
          carefully and imitatively shambled toward the protecting
          shadows ahead. There was no ship visible, as I had
          half-expected there would be. Instead, the first thing which
          caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the
          abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky,
          tarpaulin-covered object. Its rowers, though distantly and
          indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent
          aspect. Several swimmers were still discernible; while on
          the far black reef I could see a faint, steady glow unlike
          the winking beacon visible before, and of a curious colour
          which I could not precisely identify. Above the slant roofs
          ahead and to the right there loomed the tall cupola of the
          Gilman House, but it was completely dark. The fishy odour,
          dispelled for a moment by some merciful breeze, now closed
          in again with maddening intensity. </p>
 
        <p>I had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering
          band advancing along Washington from the north. As they
          reached the broad open space where I had had my first
          disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water I could see them
          plainly only a block away - and was horrified by the bestial
          abnormality of their faces and the doglike sub-humanness of
          their crouching gait. One man moved in a positively simian
          way, with long arms frequently touching the ground; while
          another figure - robed and tiaraed - seemed to progress in
          an almost hopping fashion. I judged this party to be the one
          I had seen in the Gilman's courtyard - the one, therefore,
          most closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned to
          look in my direction I was transfixed with fright, yet
          managed to preserve the casual, shambling gait I had
          assumed. To this day I do not know whether they saw me or
          not. If they did, my stratagem must have deceived them, for
          they passed on across the moonlit space without varying
          their course - meanwhile croaking and jabbering in some
          hateful guttural patois I could not identify.
          </p>
 
        <p>Once more in shadow, I resumed my former dog-trot past the
          leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the
          night. Having crossed to the western sidewalk I rounded the
          nearest corner into Bates Street where I kept close to the
          buildings on the southern side. I passed two houses shewing
          signs of habitation, one of which had faint lights in upper
          rooms, yet met with no obstacle. As I tuned into Adams
          Street I felt measurably safer, but received a shook when a
          man reeled out of a black doorway directly in front of
          me. He proved, however, too hopelessly drunk to be a menace;
          so that I reached the dismal ruins of the Bank Street
          warehouses in safety. </p>
 
        <p>No one was stirring in that dead street beside the
          river-gorge, and the roar of the waterfalls quite drowned my
          foot steps. It was a long dog-trot to the ruined station,
          and the great brick warehouse walls around me seemed somehow
          more terrifying than the fronts of private houses. At last I
          saw the ancient arcaded station - or what was left of it -
          and made directly for the tracks that started from its
          farther end. </p>
 
        <p>The rails were rusty but mainly intact, and not more than
          half the ties had rotted away.  Walking or running on such a
          surface was very difficult; but I did my best, and on the
          whole made very fair time. For some distance the line kept
          on along the gorge's brink, but at length I reached the long
          covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzying
          height. The condition of this bridge would determine my next
          step. If humanly possible, I would use it; if not, l would
          have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest
          intact highway bridge. </p>
 
        <p>The vast, barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed
          spectrally in the moonlight, and I saw that the ties were
          safe for at least a few feet within. Entering, I began to
          use my flashlight, and was almost knocked down by the cloud
          of bats that flapped past me. About half-way across there
          was a perilous gap in the ties which I feared for a moment
          would halt me; but in the end I risked a desperate jump
          which fortunately succeeded. </p>
 
        <p>I was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from
          that macabre tunnel. The old tracks crossed River Street at
          grade, and at once veered off into a region increasingly
          rural and with less and less of Innsmouth's abhorrent fishy
          odour. Here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me
          and cruelly tore at my clothes, but I was none the less glad
          that they were there to give me concealment in case of
          peril. I knew that much of my route must be visible from the
          Rowley road. </p>
 
        <p>The marshy region began very abruptly, with the single
          track on a low, grassy embankment where the weedy growth was
          somewhat thinner. Then came a sort of island of higher
          ground, where the line passed through a shallow open cut
          choked with bushes and brambles. I was very glad of this
          partial shelter, since at this point the Rowley road was
          uncomfortably near according to my window view. At the end
          of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a
          safer distance; but meanwhile I must be exceedingly careful.
          I was by this time thankfully certain that the railway
          itself was not patrolled. </p>
 
        <p>Just before entering the cut I glanced behind me, but saw
          no pursuer. The ancient spires and roofs of decaying
          Innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow
          moonlight, and I thought of how they must have looked in the
          old days before the shadow fell. Then, as my gaze circled
          inland from the town, something less tranquil arrested my
          notice and held me immobile for a second. </p>
 
        <p>What I saw - or fancied I saw - was a disturbing suggestion
          of undulant motion far to the south; a suggestion which made
          me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of
          the city along the level Ipswich road. The distance was
          great and I could distinguish nothing in detail; but I did
          not at all like the look of that moving column. It undulated
          too much, and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now
          westering moon. There was a suggestion of sound, too, though
          the wind was blowing the other way - a suggestion of bestial
          scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the
          parties I had lately overheard. </p>
 
        <p>All sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I
          thought of those very extreme Innsmouth types said to be
          hidden in crumbling, centuried warrens near the waterfront;
          I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers I had
          seen. Counting the parties so far glimpsed, as well as those
          presumably covering other roads, the number of my pursuers
          must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as
          Innsmouth. </p>
 
        <p>Whence could come the dense personnel of such a column as I
          now beheld? Did those ancient, unplumbed warrens teem with a
          twisted, uncatalogued, and unsuspected life? Or had some
          unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown outsiders on
          that hellish reef? Who were they? Why were they here? And if
          such a column of them was scouring the Ipswich road, would
          the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented? </p>
 
        <p>I had entered the brush-grown cut and was struggling along
          at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again
          waxed dominant. Had the wind suddenly changed eastward, so
          that it blew in from the sea and over the town? It must
          have, I concluded, since I now began to hear shocking
          guttural murmurs from that hitherto silent direction. There
          was another sound, too - a kind of wholesale, colossal
          flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the
          most detestable sort. It made me think illogically of that
          unpleasantly undulating column on the far-off Ipswich road.
          </p>
 
        <p>And then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I
          paused shivering and grateful for the cut's protection. It
          was here, I recalled, that the Rowley road drew so close to
          the old railway before crossing westward and diverging.
          Something was coming along that road, and I must lie low
          till its passage and vanishment in the distance. Thank
          heaven these creatures employed no dogs for tracking -
          though perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the
          omnipresent regional odour. Crouched in the bushes of that
          sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe, even though I knew the
          searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not
          much more than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see
          them, but they could not, except by a malign miracle, see
          me. </p>
 
        <p>All at once I began dreading to look at them as they
          passed. I saw the close moonlit space where they would surge
          by, and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable
          pollution of that space. They would perhaps be the worst of
          all Innsmouth types - something one would not care to
          remember. </p>
 
        <p>The stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a
          bestial babel of croaking, baying and barking without the
          least suggestion of human speech. Were these indeed the
          voices of my pursuers? Did they have dogs after all?  So far
          I had seen none of the lower animals in Innsmouth. That
          flopping or pattering was monstrous - I could not look upon
          the degenerate creatures responsible for it. I would keep my
          eyes shut till the sound receded toward the west. The horde
          was very close now - air foul with their hoarse snarlings,
          and the ground almost shaking with their alien-rhythmed
          footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to come, and I put every
          ounce of will-power into the task of holding my eyelids
          down. </p>
 
        <p>I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was
          a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination. The
          later action of the government, after my frantic appeals,
          would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth; but could not
          an hallucination have been repeated under the quasi-hypnotic
          spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowed town? Such
          places have strange properties, and the legacy of insane
          legend might well have acted on more than one human
          imagination amidst those dead, stench-cursed streets and
          huddles of rotting roofs and crumbling steeples. Is it not
          possible that the germ of an actual contagious madness lurks
          in the depths of that shadow over Innsmouth? Who can be sure
          of reality after hearing things like the tale of old Zadok
          Allen? The government men never found poor Zadok, and have
          no conjectures to make as to what became of him. Where does
          madness leave off and reality begin? Is it possible that
          even my latest fear is sheer delusion? </p>
 
        <p>But I must try to tell what I thought I saw that night
          under the mocking yellow moon - saw surging and hopping down
          the Rowley road in plain sight in front of me as I crouched
          among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut. Of
          course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed. It was
          foredoomed to failure - for who could crouch blindly while a
          legion of croaking, baying entities of unknown source
          flopped noisomely past, scarcely more than a hundred yards
          away? </p>
 
        <p>I thought I was prepared for the worst, and I really ought
          to have been prepared considering what I had seen
          before. </p>
 
        <p>My other pursuers had been accursedly abnormal - so should
          I not have been ready to face a strengthening of the
          abnormal element; to look upon forms in which there was no
          mixture of the normal at all? I did not open my eyes until
          the raucous clamour came loudly from a point obviously
          straight ahead.  Then I knew that a long section of them
          must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut
          flattened out and the road crossed the track - and I could
          no longer keep myself from sampling whatever honor that
          leering yellow moon might have to shew. </p>
 
        <p>It was the end, for whatever remains to me of life on the
          surface of this earth, of every vestige of mental peace and
          confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human
          mind. Nothing that I could have imagined - nothing, even,
          that I could have gathered had I credited old Zadok's crazy
          tale in the most literal way - would be in any way
          comparable to the demoniac, blasphemous reality that I saw -
          or believe I saw. I have tied to hint what it was in order
          to postpone the horror of writing it down baldly.  Can it be
          possible that this planet has actually spawned such things;
          that human eyes have truly seen, as objective flesh, what
          man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous
          legend? </p>
 
        <p>And yet I saw them in a limitless stream - flopping,
          hopping, croaking, bleating - urging inhumanly through the
          spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of
          fantastic nightmare. And some of them had tall tiaras of
          that nameless whitish-gold metal ... and some were strangely
          robed ... and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly
          humped black coat and striped trousers, and had a man's felt
          hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a
          head. </p>
 
        <p>I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green,
          though they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and
          slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly.  Their
          forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
          were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that
          never closed. At the sides of their necks were palpitating
          gills, and their long paws were webbed. They hopped
          irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I
          was somehow glad that they had no more than four
          limbs. Their croaking, baying voices, clearly wed tar
          articulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression
          which their staring faces lacked. </p>
 
        <p>But for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar
          to me. I knew too well what they must be - for was not the
          memory of the evil tiara at Newburyport still fresh? They
          were the blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless design -
          living and horrible - and as I saw them I knew also of what
          that humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement had
          fearsomely reminded me. Their number was past guessing. It
          seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of them and
          certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only the
          least fraction. In another instant everything was blotted
          out by a merciful fit of fainting; the first I had ever
          had. </p>
 
        <h4 align="center">V</h4>

        <p>It was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me front my
          stupor in the brush-grown railway cut, and when I staggered
          out to the roadway ahead I saw no trace of any prints in the
          fresh mud. The fishy odour, too, was gone, Innsmouth's
          ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up greyly toward
          the southeast, but not a living creature did I spy in all
          the desolate salt marshes around. My watch was still going,
          and told me that the hour was past noon. </p>
 
        <p>The reality of what I had been through was highly uncertain
          in my mind, but I felt that something hideous lay in the
          background. I must get away from evil-shadowed Innsmouth -
          and accordingly I began to test my cramped, wearied powers
          of locomotion. Despite weakness hunger, horror, and
          bewilderment I found myself after a time able to walk; so
          started slowly along the muddy road to Rowley. Before
          evening I was in village, getting a meal and providing
          myself with presentable cloths. I caught the night train to
          Arkham, and the next day talked long and earnestly with
          government officials there; a process I later repeated in
          Boston. With the main result of these colloquies the public
          is now familiar - and I wish, for normality's sake, there
          were nothing more to tell. Perhaps it is madness that is
          overtaking me - yet perhaps a greater horror - or a greater
          marvel - is reaching out. </p>
 
        <p>As may well be imagined, I gave up most of the foreplanned
          features of the rest of my tour - the scenic, architectural,
          and antiquarian diversions on which I had counted so
          heavily. Nor did I dare look for that piece of strange
          jewelry said to be in the Miskatonic University Museum. I
          did, however, improve my stay in Arkham by collecting some
          genealogical notes I had long wished to possess; very rough
          and hasty data, it is true, but capable of good use later no
          when I might have time to collate and codify them. The
          curator of the historical society there - Mr. B. Lapham
          Peabody - was very courteous about assisting me, and
          expressed unusual interest when I told him I was a grandson
          of Eliza Orne of Arkham, who was born in 1867 and had
          married James Williamson of Ohio at the age of seventeen.
          </p>
 
        <p>It seemed that a material uncle of mine had been there many
          years before on a quest much like my own; and that my
          grandmother's family was a topic of some local
          curiosity. There had, Mr. Peabody said, been considerable
          discussion about the marriage of her father, Benjamin Orne,
          just after the Civil War; since the ancestry of the bride
          was peculiarly puzzling. That bride was understood to have
          been an orphaned Marsh of New Hampshire - a cousin of the
          Essex County Marshes - but her education had been in France
          and she knew very little of her family. A guardian had
          deposited funds in a Boston bank to maintain her and her
          French governess; but that guardian's name was unfamiliar to
          Arkham people, and in time he dropped out of sight, so that
          the governess assumed the role by court appointment.  The
          Frenchwoman - now long dead - was very taciturn, and there
          were those who said she would have told more than she
          did. </p>
 
        <p>But the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to
          place the recorded parents of the young woman - Enoch and
          Lydia (Meserve) Marsh - among the known families of New
          Hampshire. Possibly, many suggested, she was the natural
          daughter of some Marsh of prominence - she certainly had the
          true Marsh eyes.  Most of the puzzling was done after her
          early death, which took place at the birth of my grandmother
          - her only child. Having formed some disagreeable
          impressions connected with the name of Marsh, I did not
          welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree;
          nor was I pleased by Mr. Peabody's suggestion that I had the
          true Marsh eyes myself. However, I was grateful for data
          which I knew would prove valuable; and took copious notes
          and lists of book references regarding the well-documented
          Orne family. </p>
 
        <p>I went directly home to Toledo from Boston, and later spent
          a month at Maumee recuperating from my ordeal. In September
          I entered Oberlin for my final year, and from then till the
          next June was busy with studies and other wholesome
          activities - reminded of the bygone terror only by
          occasional official visits from government men in connexion
          with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had
          started. Around the middle of July - just a year after the
          Innsmouth experience - I spent a week with my late mother's
          family in Cleveland; checking some of my new genealogical
          data with the various notes, traditions, and bits of
          heirloom material in existence there, and seeing what kind
          of a connected chart I could construct. </p>
 
        <p>I did not exactly relish this task, for the atmosphere of
          the Williamson home had always depressed me. There was a
          strain of morbidity there, and my mother had never
          encouraged my visiting her parents as a child, although she
          always welcomed her father when he came to Toledo. My
          Arkham-born grandmother had seemed strange and almost
          terrifying to me, and I do not think I grieved when she
          disappeared. I was eight years old then, and it was said
          that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my
          Uncle Douglas, her eldest son. He had shot himself after a
          trip to New England - the same trip, no doubt, which had
          caused him to be recalled at the Arkham Historical
          Society. </p>
 
        <p>This uncle had resembled her, and I had never liked him
          either. Something about the staring, unwinking expression of
          both of them had given me a vague, unaccountable
          uneasiness. My mother and Uncle Walter had not looked like
          that. They were like their father, though poor little cousin
          Lawrence - Walter's son - had been almost perfect duplicate
          of his grandmother before his condition took him to the
          permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at Canton.  I had not
          seen him in four years, but my uncle once implied that his
          state, both mental and physical, was very bad. This worry
          had probably been a major cause of his mother's death two
          years before. </p>
 
        <p>My grandfather and his widowed son Walter now comprised the
          Cleveland household, but the memory of older times hung
          thickly over it. I still disliked the place, and tried to
          get my researches done as quickly as possible. Williamson
          records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my
          grandfather; though for Orne material I had to depend on my
          uncle Walter, who put at my disposal the contents of all his
          files, including notes, letters, cuttings, heirlooms,
          photographs, and miniatures. </p>
 
        <p>It was in going over the letters and pictures on the Orne
          side that I began to acquire a kind of terror of my own
          ancestry. As I have said, my grandmother and Uncle Douglas
          had always disturbed me. Now, years after their passing, I
          gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened
          feeling of repulsion and alienation. I could not at first
          understand the change, but gradually a horrible sort of
          comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind
          despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even
          the least suspicion of it. It was clear that the typical
          expression of these faces now suggested something it had not
          suggested before - something which would bring stark panic
          if too openly thought of. </p>
 
        <p>But the worst shock came when my uncle shewed me the Orne
          jewellery in a downtown safe deposit vault. Some of the
          items were delicate and inspiring enough, but there was one
          box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious
          great-grandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to
          produce. They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost
          repulsive design, and had never to his knowledge been
          publicly worn; though my grandmother used to enjoy looking
          at them. Vague legends of bad luck clustered around them,
          and my great-grandmother's French governess had said they
          ought not to be worn in New England, though it would be
          quite safe to wear them in Europe. </p>
 
        <p>As my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the
          things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and
          frequent hideousness of the designs. Artists and
          archaeologists who had seen them pronounced their
          workmanship superlatively and exotically exquisite, though
          no one seemed able to define their exact material or assign
          them to any specific art tradition. There were two armlets,
          a tiara, and a kind of pectoral; the latter having in high
          relief certain figures of almost unbearable
          extravagance. </p>
 
        <p>During this description I had kept a tight rein on my
          emotions, but my face must have betrayed my mounting
          fears. My uncle looked concerned, and paused in his
          unwrapping to study my countenance. I motioned to him to
          continue, which he did with renewed signs of reluctance. He
          seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piece -
          the tiara - became visible, but I doubt if he expected quite
          what actually happened. I did not expect it, either, for I
          thought I was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the
          jewellery would turn out to be. What I did was to faint
          silently away, just as I had done in that brier choked
          railway cut a year before. </p>
 
        <p>From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding
          and apprehension nor do I know how much is hideous truth and
          how much madness. My great-grandmother had been a Marsh of
          unknown source whose husband lived in Arkham - and did not
          old Zadok say that the daughter of Obed Marsh by a monstrous
          mother was married to an Arkham man trough trick? What was
          it the ancient toper had muttered about the line of my eyes
          to Captain Obed's? In Arkham, too, the curator had told me I
          had the true Marsh eyes. Was Obed Marsh my own
          great-great-grandfather? Who - or what - then, was my
          great-great-grandmother?  But perhaps this was all
          madness. Those whitish-gold ornaments might easily have been
          bought from some Innsmouth sailor by the father of my
          great-grand-mother, whoever he was. And that look in the
          staring-eyed faces of my grandmother and self-slain uncle
          might be sheer fancy on my part - sheer fancy, bolstered up
          by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my
          imagination. But why had my uncle killed himself after an
          ancestral quest in New England? </p>
 
        <p>For more than two years l fought off these reflections with
          partial success. My father secured me a place in an
          insurance office, and I buried myself in routine as deeply
          as possible. In the winter of 1930-31, however, the dreams
          began. They were very sparse and insidious at first, but
          increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went
          by. Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed
          to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of
          weedy cyclopean walls with grotesque fishes as my
          companions. Then the other shapes began to appear, filling
          me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But during the
          dreams they did not horrify me at all - I was one with them;
          wearing their unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous
          ways, and praying monstrously at their evil sea-bottom
          temples. </p>
 
        <p>There was much more than I could remember, but even what I
          did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a
          madman or a genius if ever I dared write it down. Some
          frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to drag
          me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable
          abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process told
          heavily on me. My health and appearance grew steadily worse,
          till finally I was forced to give up my position and adopt
          the static, secluded life of an invalid. Some odd nervous
          affliction had me in its grip, and I found myself at times
          almost unable to shut my eyes. </p>
 
        <p>It was then that I began to study the mirror with mounting
          alarm. The slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to
          watch, but in my case there was something subtler and more
          puzzling in the background. My father seemed to notice it,
          too, for he began looking at me curiously and almost
          affrightedly.  What was taking place in me? Could it be that
          I was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle Douglas?
          </p>
 
        <p>One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my
          grandmother under the sea. She lived in a phosphorescent
          palace of many terraces, with gardens of strange leprous
          corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences, and welcomed
          me with a warmth that may have been sardonic. She had
          changed - as those who take to the water change - and told
          me she had never died. Instead, she had gone to a spot her
          dead son had learned about, and had leaped to a realm whose
          wonders - destined for him as well - he had spurned with a
          smoking pistol. This was to be my realm, too - I could not
          escape it. I would never die, but would live with those who
          had lived since before man ever walked the earth. </p>
 
        <p>I met also that which had been her grandmother. For eighty
          thousand years Pth'thya-l'yi had lived in Y'ha-nthlei, and
          thither she had gone back after Obed Marsh was
          dead. Y'ha-nthlei was not destroyed when the upper-earth men
          shot death into the sea. It was hurt, but not destroyed. The
          Deep Ones could never be destroyed, even though the
          palaeogean magic of the forgotten Old Ones might sometimes
          check them. For the present they would rest; but some day,
          if they remembered, they would rise again for the tribute
          Great Cthulhu craved. It would be a city greater than
          Innsmouth next time. They had planned to spread, and had
          brought up that which would help them, but now they must
          wait once more. For bringing the upper-earth men's death I
          must do a penance, but that would not be heavy. This was the
          dream in which I saw a shoggoth for the first time, and the
          sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming. That morning
          the mirror definitely told me I had acquired the Innsmouth
          look. </p>
 
        <p>So far I have not shot myself as my uncle Douglas did. I
          bought an automatic and almost took the step, but certain
          dreams deterred me. The tense extremes of horror are
          lessening, and I feel queerly drawn toward the unknown
          sea-deeps instead of fearing them. I hear and do strange
          things in sleep, and awake with a kind of exaltation instead
          of terror. I do not believe I need to wait for the full
          change as most have waited. If I did, my father would
          probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin
          is shut up. Stupendous and unheard-of splendors await me
          below, and I shall seek them soon. Ia-R'lyehl Cihuiha
          flgagnl id Ia! No, I shall not shoot myself - I cannot be
          made to shoot myself! </p>
 
        <p>I shall plan my cousin's escape from that Canton mad-house,
          and together we shall go to marvel-shadowed Innsmouth. We
          shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive
          down through black abysses to Cyclopean and many-columned
          Y'ha-nthlei, and in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall
          dwell amidst wonder and glory for ever. </p>

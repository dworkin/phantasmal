      Articles for Phantasmal and Innsmouth Developers </h3>

    <p> I've repeatedly recommended the various Skotos articles.
      Not only do I have definite personal favorites, there
      are also definitely articles that are more relevant
      to Innsmouth or just generally more informative and
      specific than others.  But I haven't been very
      good about telling anybody which ones.  This page
      is meant for articles, Skotos and otherwise, that I
      consider strongly relevant to Phantasmal's or Innsmouth's
      development
      in one way or another.  Or, y'know, I just think they're
      cool.  Whichever. </p>

    <p> Don't take a column's lack of presence on this page as
      an indictment -- I haven't listed everything I care about,
      everything I liked or even the best stuff that's relevant
      to Innsmouth.  But this gets <i>something</i> up that
      I can recommend to people. </p>

    <h3> From &quot;Trials, Triumphs and Trivialities&quot; by
      Shannon Appelcline </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_Oct05.html">
	  Objectionable Economies</a>, a description of object
	economies and what you need to do to make them work.
	Not yet relevant to Innsmouth, but eventually... </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_19.html">
	  Hobgoblins, Part One </a> which describes global versus
	local verbs.  Particularly relevent to parser debates on
        the Phantasmal bboards.
      </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_20.html">
	  Hobgoblins, Part Two </a> on things like inheritance
	(multiple kinds) and consistency.  Good stuff. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_28.html">
	  The Dynamic Dilemma, Part Two</a> discusses spawning.
	Note how Phantasmal doesn't do simple spawn points yet?
	Read this.  Do it. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_33.html">
	  What a StoryBuilder Can <i>Do</i></a>, a description of
	the basics of the Skotos toolkit.  Probably outdated by
	now. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_34.html">
	  The Power of the Medium: Individualized Output </a> is
	chock-full of stuff that Phantasmal currently does nothing
	with, but eventually I'd love to. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_35.html">
	  The Power of the Medium: Text! </a> tells us yet again
	that Shannon Appelcline knows damn well what makes MUDs
	excellent. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_48.shtml">
	  Building Blocks:  Rooms</a> begins the incredible
	Building Blocks series.  Read them.  Read them all. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_50.shtml">
	  Building Blocks: Details</a>.  This one is <i>extremely</i>
	relevant as we sketch out Phantasmal's details, which are
	currently probably <i>too</i> much like Skotos'.</li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_51.shtml">
	  Building Blocks: Names</a>.  Another brilliant article
	in the series. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_53.shtml">
	  Building Blocks: Maps </a> has some lovely observations
	on mapping and consistency. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_54.shtml">
	  Building Blocks: Zones</a> is definitely not the best
	of the bunch, but still quite valuable. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_57.shtml">
	  Future Memes, Part Three: Settings and Physics</a>.
	Shannon throws a lot of curveballs to get you thinking.
	This is one I consider particularly Innsmouth-relevant.
      </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_59.shtml">
	  Building Blocks:  Portables </a> is about a lot more than
	that.  It explains some of why I've been merging so many
	types of Phantasmal objects with such zeal. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_60.shtml">
	  Building Blocks:  Data Inheritance </a> explains
	data inheritance and why it's not code inheritance.  What
	I'm planning for Phantasmal has a lot in common with this,
	though with some subtleties and differences. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_61.shtml">
	  Building Blocks Examples:  The Hologram Nexus </a> puts
	all this Building Blocks stuff into practice.  I recommend
	reading those articles first or it won't make that much
	sense. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_94.shtml">
	  The Elements of Good ScaryTelling, Part One: Haunting Themes</a>
	My experience has been that to deal with subtle storytelling
	in online games, you quickly start talking about horror games.
	Even if that's not what you're building. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> From &quot;Notes from the Dawn of Time&quot; by
      Richard Bartle </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> His <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/DAWNOF.shtml">
	  article list</a> is on Skotos.  Mainly he writes long
	series of articles, so no one individual article is as
	satisfyingly linkable as with Shannon Appelcline. </li>
      <li> His early stuff, from about 9/20/2001 to 11/28/2001
	explains a lot of why regular inheritance (not data
	inheritance) is nifty but works indifferently for MUDs.
	Worth a read if you're thinking that what we need is
	massive inheritance. </li>
      <li> After that, from about 1/2/2002 to 7/3/2002, he analyzes
	parsing in fearsome detail. </li>
      <li> And then he works on mobile AI and planning, including
	having mobiles figure out what they need and give you
	quests based on it.  That's as far as he's gotten. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> From &quot;MetaStatic &quot; by Sam Witt </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Sam Witt tends to briefly describe his ideas, with which
	I usually agree vigorously, but rarely goes into very much
	extra detail on them.  So again, he doesn't have many
	articles that I find massively linkable. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic14.html">
	  The Value of the Random Dungeon</a> describes a basic
	approach to building vast expanses.  Overall I agree with it.
	We don't have SAM (or Sam) on Phantasmal, of course. </li>

      <li> The "Death of a Thousand Cuts" series is more specific,
	though, parts
	<a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic25.html">One</a>,
	<a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic26.html">Two</a>,
	<a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic27.html">Three
	</a>, and
	<a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/metastatic28.html">Four
	</a>.  I'm not sure if I'd take this approach, but I <i>know</i>
	I respect this approach to keeping player power manageable
	and the game running reasonably.  It's the basis of a real
	object economy, among other reasons. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> From &quot;Storms on Cloud Nine&quot; by Scott
      Holliday </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Despite the name,
	<a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/storms06.shtml">
	  Evil and Wickedness</a> is basically just a guide to
	creating decently believable NPCs within current AI
	constraints. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> My stuff! </h3>

    <p>
      Since I've now got my own Skotos column, I may as well plug it.
      NeoArchaeology is me, and I'll put these up as they go up.
      Well, either that or I'll just put them up when I remember to...
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/neo1.html">Toys
        in the Attic </a> is my first column.  It's a quick survey
	of free MUD development stuff. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> From Delphine T. Lynx's &quot;Daedalian
      Musing&quot; </h3>

    <p> The column isn't applicable to Phantasmal most weeks, but a couple
      of the articles are very good and all are at least tolerable.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> His article
	<a href="http://www.mudconnect.com/articles/dm/boo.html">Boo?</a>
	is a good explanation of how to start scaring players in your
	MUD.  I agree with, oh, about 90% of it. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.mudconnect.com/articles/dm/dcrawl2.html">
	  Dungeon Crawling?: Caves</a> is a summary of what makes caves
	interesting settings in a MUD.  That's neither here nor there.
	But the same article has truly <i>excellent</i> unpredictable
	ways to get players into and out of MUD settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.kanga.nu/mirrors/mu.ranter.net/theory/">
	  Mu's Unbelievably Long and Disjointed Ramblings About RPG
	  Design</a> hits a little of everything.  Game balance, what
	you have to do in a fantasy game to keep idiots happy, everything
	about medieval and fantasy objects and their economy, game
	design wisdom...  Pretty much everything's excellent, but
	<i>do not</i>, under any circumstances, skip the
	<b>Food Basis</b> section.  It's probably the best
	article anywhere on how medieval geography and agriculture
	holds together. </li>

      <li> <a href="http://members.aol.com/essuncius/cover4.htm">Uncle
        Figgy's Guide to Good Fantasy</a> explores the 'realistic'
        effects of magic on a fantasy setting.  It talks about various
        types and levels of magic, and the social effects that those
        magics would have on other professions. </li>

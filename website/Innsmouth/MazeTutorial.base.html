<h3 style="text-align: center">Molly O'Hara's Maze Tutorial</h3>

<p>Molly O'Hara of 4Dimensions.org posted this maze tutorial to a
board on TopMUDSites.com. I'm reposting it here because hey, it's
good.</p>

<p>Here's something simple for all codebases. MAZES. Most players
hate them, but we all use them, to add some space between other
zones, and also to torment them a bit. But not all new Builders
know how to make a Maze right, so here is a crash course:</p>

<p>Basically there are two types of mazes, linear or grids,
representing the winding tunnels in a Dungeon or a seemingly
endless prairie or forest. Mostly they are created in the same
simple way, by linking the rooms back in circles, and here's where
inexperienced Builders quite often go wrong.</p>

<p>Linking in circles is fine, unless you do it on a straight line
with too short distance between the back-linked rooms. The minimum
distance is the number of rooms you can see other chars in, when
looking in a direction. Otherwise you are going to see yourself,
and that immediately gives the trick away. So the smallest
functional maze you can make is 4 rooms, linked in a square, like
this</p>
<pre>

</pre>

<p>To make a maze out of this you just need to link a to d both
north and west, and then link the three other rooms after the same
principle. Even a mini maze like this can keep some players running
around in circles for ages, but of course the more rooms you use,
the harder it gets. And the room descs don't HAVE to be all similar
either, even though that's the most common. A maze can be just as
confusing - and a lot more interesting - with individual descs.</p>

<p>We have a 100 room desert, that is a grid maze, where the rooms
are all individual. The desert has a definite topography with
ridges, depressions and a couple of waterholes, and because of the
circle linking it gets repetitive in a certain rhythm, but
basically you can wander around there forever. The desert code
makes it a nasty place, where you mostly need to find some shadow
during daytime, and move only at night. And it has had several
players begging to be let out, because the exit is quite hard to
find, and we made the entire zone !recall, !teleport and
!summon-out too.</p>

<p>The exit from a maze is of course the funny thing to make. It
can be something as simple as a closed or hidden door, but it can
also be something subtler, like an invisible portal or some mob
letting you out in return for a favour. Or it can be a nasty trick.
Below is an example of the latter. (This maze is in our Mud School,
so I am not giving any big secrets away).</p>
<hr>

<p>Before they enter the Maze, the player gets the following
information:<br>
When you go east from this room, you'll enter a maze. It is not
very large, but it can still be pretty confusing. The rooms look
all the same, so it will be a bit hard to figure out where you are.
The Quest is simply to find the way out of the maze. Apart from the
obvious solution of just going DOWN to Recall and dropping out, of
course. *snicker*.</p>

<p>The maze itself is only 6 rooms, linked after the principle in
the example above, and each room looks like this:</p>

<p>In A Large Forest [ Exits: n e s w d ]<br>
The forest is large, the trees tower above your head. Very little
light penetrates through the dense foliage, not even in the middle
of the day. Although there is no undergrowth blocking the view,
this forest is still confusing, since every direction looks the
same. The ground is covered with sparse grass, and there are
several rabbit holes here, so watch your step. Occasionally you
catch a glimpse of one of these cotton-tails, scampering away at
the sound of your footsteps.</p>

<p>You can go in all cardinal directions in all rooms. Looking in
any direction gives the same info: "All directions look the same in
this forest".</p>

<p>Looking up, only shows the sky above, so that is no option.
Climbing the trees doesn't work either. Looking down gives this
info: "A small rabbit hole leads down." And also shows up the usual
lazy crowd of players squatting at Recall.</p>

<p>There are no hidden doors or portals anywhere. So how do you get
out?</p>

<p>Easy. You go down.</p>

<p>One of the six rooms is different, the exit down leads to an
extra room, which in turns leads down to Recall. The attentive
player would notice this because of the message about the players
down there. Instead of "You see Soandso immediately to the down",
in one of the rooms it will say "close by to the down" instead.</p>

<p>But since this Maze is in the Mud School, we want to teach the
new players to use the not-so-common options LISTEN and SMELL, and
therefor we put the main clue there. So in 5 of the rooms you get
the Listen message "You hear the wind in the crowns of the trees"
while in the room with the exit you get "A rustling sound is coming
from the rabbit hole below. Wow, that hole is really uncommonly
big!"</p>

<p>That's one if the things you can use the extra descs for.</p>
<hr>

<p>On a side note:<br>
There are some coded or scripted ways to make mazes too, and at
least one of them is downloadable from the net. Exits get opened
and shut randomly as the zone resets, so it's never quite the same.
But I really don't like those options myself. To me it makes sense
that once you have mapped a maze, you should be able to follow the
same path next time you enter it. We do have one Maze however,
which is scripted to give an individual path for each player who
makes it through. For each individual player the path is always the
same, but no two players get the same route. This was made to stop
the blabbering among some players who told each other the
directions, and was of course very effective. But it also took a
pretty long and complicated script to set it up, and even though I
am fond of scripts, I prefer things to be simple.</p>

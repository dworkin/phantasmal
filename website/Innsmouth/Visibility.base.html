    <h3 style="text-align: center"> MUD Visibility and Perception
        for Phantasmal </h3>

    <p>
      Visibility should be important to Phantasmal -- light levels, lines
      of sight, ability to notice details.  These things are linked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most MUDs place limited importance on visibility because allowing
      very perceptive characters to notice vast amounts of detail gets
      very distracting very quickly.  In, say, a forest setting, there are
      simply too many things going on.  The challenge, then, is not to
      determine whether a character can detect particular things, but
      to reduce the amount of detail coming in to a manageable level.
      Phantasmal will eventually attempt both tasks.
    </p>

    <h3> Detecting Detail </h3>

    <p>
      Detecting detail is a matter of determining what the player can
      determine about the environment around him.  There are many events
      occurring constantly -- mobiles move, objects are gotten and dropped,
      mobiles speak or fidget.  The question, then, is which ones the
      player or character can detect, and how those events appear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lines of sight are among the simplest ways to manage this -- in
      a given location, there is effectively a list of other locations
      that are visible.  Since it isn't really possible to tell where a
      character is within that location (Phantasmal doesn't use a
      coordinate grid), we must simply assume that character can
      potentially see
      events in every location on the list of visible locations.  Audible
      locations are similar -- a character can hear events occurring in
      any location on the &quot;audible list&quot;, potentially.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other senses -- taste, touch and smell -- are all localized.  A
      character can only taste, touch or smell in his current location,
      or one containing it.  Smells can propagate, but a character cannot
      instantaneously detect a smell in another location.
    </p>

    <p>
      Locations that are visible or audible from the current location
      will still (usually) transmit sights and sounds less well than
      if the character were standing in that location.  Each will
      effectively have a percentage of the visibility/audibility that
      is actually transmitted.  Note that in the case of visibility,
      this is not transitive -- you can't see a location that is visible
      from another location automatically.  Otherwise you could always see
      around corners!  While it might make sense to propagate sounds
      automatically (and at some level, this will need to occur), Phantasmal
      will internally simply use an audible-list just like the
      visible-list since all of this information can be determined when
      the objects are connected by exits.
     </p>

     <p>
       Objects in Phantasmal can have alternate low-light descriptions.
       These are usually part of the markup of the object description,
       though they can be detected programmatically if necessary.
       These are not specifically low-light descriptions, but are rather
       low-detail descriptions.  For instance, an object seen through
       fog, or in darkness, or far away, or without glasses, would use
       this description.  Thus a tall, brown-haired man might be
       &quot;a man&quot; or &quot;somebody tall&quot; at a distance.
       Similarly, to recognize another character you must be close enough
       and in good enough lighting and visibility to know who you're
       looking at.
     </p>

     <p>
       Conceivably, this could be used to &quot;mis-recognize&quot;
       people for mysterious, dramatic or comedic effect.  That's longer
       term, though.
     </p>

     <p>
       And finally, some objects require appropriate skills, abilities
       or characteristics to recognize.  For instance, you might need
       to be an Angel or Demon to recognize a &quot;tin can of mightly
       slaying, blessed to the Lord&quot;, or have a good grasp of
       philately to notice a valuable misprint stamp on a postcard.
       Objects in the class heirarchy can mark themselves as requiring
       particular skills or attributes to recognize, and players without
       those skills or attributes will simply see the object as the
       next-most-general in the heirarchy -- the valuable misprint
       stamp would be simply a stamp, the blessed tin can would be
       simply a tin can, or garbage.
     </p>

    <h3> Managing Detail </h3>

    <p>
      The most difficult part is not creating all of this detail, but
      keeping the player from being overwhelmed.  Phantasmal eventually
      hopes to have several mechanisms for this -- Object Grouping,
      Event Grouping, Perceptual Thresholds, and Automatic Detail Adjustment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Object Grouping is described in its own separate document, and
      relies heavily on the class heirarchy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Event Grouping is the idea that many events occurring simultaneously
      can be grouped into a single message.  For instance, twenty
      balloons popping at once (perhaps a result of an air pressure
      change) might say that &quot;a large cluster of balloons all pop at
      once&quot; rather than having twenty separate messages about the
      balloons popping.  The trick is to detect that these events are
      occurring roughly simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, events of different types could be grouped in essentially
      the same way -- the sound of a cannon roaring, the smell of gunpowder
      and a small tremor in the earth could be grouped together into
      &quot;a cannon fires nearby!  It's incredibly loud!&quot;, but a
      character farther away would only feel the tremor, and a deaf
      character in the dark might only smell gunpowder.  This combination,
      if implemented well, could also allow certain deception to occur.
      For instance, a spell that caused a tremor in the earth could be
      masked by cannonfire, or a magically-muffled cannon could be used
      to convince nearby enemies that such a spell had been cast (but
      the smell might give it away!).
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously there's a limit to what events can be grouped, but in
      many cases (such as the cannon above), the events could be
      dispatched all at once, specifically marked as being mergeable.
      Characters that could detect all of the events would see them
      as merged, while characters that couldn't perceive one or more
      would see only the relevant parts of the event.  As the grouping
      system got better it could notice events like separate balloons
      popping independently and group them, or group all sounds or
      smells together if they occur quickly, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      More difficult is grouping <i>sequential</i> events that are
      related.  For instance, sharpening a sword might involve taking
      out a whetstone, oiling it, using it many times and then putting
      everything away again.  It isn't necessary to give continual
      updates on the status of the activity unless something interrupts
      it.  So the events should be grouped as a sequence, so that if
      all goes well the player will see only &quot; you begin sharpening
      the sword&quot; and, eventually, &quot;you finish sharpening
      the sword&quot;.  However, if the whetstone oil contains nasty
      grit which prevents you from using it, you might see:
    </p>
<pre>
  > sharpen sword
  You take out a whetstone from your backpack.
  You take out whetstone oil from your backpack.
  You pour the whetstone oil on the whetstone.
  Yuck!  Your whetstone oil is black and gritty, and now your
        whetstone is all dirty and greasy!
  > swear like a golfer
</pre>

    <p>
      Perceptual Thresholds are a name for preventing a character
      from detecting things that are too far apart in intensity.
      Thus, it's very difficult to smell something subtle when
      there's red herring in the air.  It's hard to see the fine
      detail of a Ming vase when you're blinded by a flash of
      magnesium powder burning, and when a cannon goes off, it's hard
      to hear yourself think :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      When a character has a vast amount of information coming in,
      even if none of that information is especially intense (as in
      Perceptual Thresholds above), the least noteworthy (probably
      approximated as the least-perceptible by default) will be
      lost until a reasonable amount of information is available.
      For instance, a character running rapidly through the woods
      will probably get shorter room descriptions (cutting out
      less perceptible or noteworthy bits) and won't see the ants
      crawling along or hear the birdsong -- those things aren't
      as noteworthy as the basic room description, and the information
      is simply coming in too fast.

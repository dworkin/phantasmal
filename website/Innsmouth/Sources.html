    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Innsmouth MUD's Sources and Policies </h2>

    <p> Chaosium materials aren't the
      definitive source for Lovecraft stuff.
      The phrase &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; refers to a collection not
      only of Lovecraft's work, but also of several others' --
      Ramsey Campbell, August Derleth, and Brian Lumley for instance.
      Certain aspects of the other writers' stories
      may clash with the bleak horror of Lovecraft's original
      settings.  Like Chaosium, Innsmouth MUD
      restricts itself specifically to the fiction
      we feel is appropriate for our use.  However, we're mostly
      limiting ourselves to the works of the Gentleman from Providence
      himself.
    </p>

    <p> Any unintended deviations in Innsmouth MUD from
      the actual works by
      Lovecraft will be corrected if players point them out.
      But bear in mind that not all
      settings are in exactly the situation described by Lovecraft.  For
      instance, not every day would see Zadok Allen out to look for a
      tourist.  But we try to maintain things in a condition where
      Lovecraft's stories <i>could be</i> a snapshot of our setting,
      probably at a different time.  Day-to-day deviations are
      fine -- if Joe Sargent's bus isn't in the town square at midnight,
      or one day it happens to be broken down, we consider that a feature and
      not a bug. </p>

    <p> There are aspects of the Chaosium materials I try not to use.
      Mostly, they're the parts not
      derived directly from Lovecraft or from actual 1920s history.
      That's for legal reasons as much as anything else.  I greatly
      respect Chaosium and I have no wish to steal their intellectual
      property.  However, I'd also prefer to avoid gratuitous
      differences.  For instance, if we ever do Arkham we'll also use
      Gahan Wilson's street map.  But Chaosium materials aren't
      definitive in Innsmouth MUD, not about situations, locations
      and horrors, and certainly not about what characters live at what
      street addresses.  Deviations
      from Chaosium's source material are expected and encouraged.
    </p>

    <p> For those of you who have played CthulhuMUD:  I have no
      plans to allow the playing of Shoggoths, Mi-Go, Deep Ones,
      Yithians (Great Race), Zoogs or other nonhuman races
      any time soon.  Having a class of players whose primary
      purpose involves hunting and killing human beings fits very
      poorly into my current plans for the MUD.  I may eventually
      consider adding something of this kind in a very limited,
      very roleplaying-specific capacity.  But even in that case
      it would have very little in common with, say, the
      CthulhuMUD &quot;mi-go brain hunter&quot; class. </p>

    <p> Also for those of you who played CthulhuMUD:  I like
      and respect many of the policies they maintained.
      For instance, those about newbie-harassment, in-character versus
      out-of-character interaction, and cheating.  CthulhuMUD
      and Blood Dusk have the policies I most respect of the
      MUDs I've played, and the policies that have lent the most
      to the feel of the game.  Expect some similarities.  Also,
      expect some differences.

<p>These are poorly-organized thoughts about persistence in MUDs,
and various issues related to it.</p>

<h3>Time in MUDs, and Continuity</h3>

<p>In-MUD time has a conversion factor associated with it -- that
is, it's a multiple of real-world wall-clock time. How long a
real-world day is in the MUD (and vice-versa) depends on that
conversion. This leads to a whole host of realism problems related
to things like travel time and reaction time, but we're going to
ignore all those for now as not being related to persistence.</p>

<p>There's a problem that <i>does</i> have to do with
persistence... When the MUD goes down for awhile there'll be a jump
in real-world time. This includes scheduled maintenance, not just
crashes. The question is how the MUD should address that.</p>

<p>Some ways we could deal with the programmatic interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep going forward, running all the scripts and triggers,
  until we catch up. That could be *really* slow on startup, and
  there are questions of safety and things if players are logged in
  at the time, or if their bodies or possessions are vulnerable. A
  lot of time can go by all at once...</li>

  <li>Cancel all the call_outs, but make some way to subscribe for
  a notification when the time skips to reschedule them. That
  requires a lot of code on the part of anybody that reschedules.
  But for events that should just happen every so often, but we
  don't care about their cumulative effects, it works great.</li>

  <li>Keep going like nothing happened -- this would require any
  events that really cared about real-world time to check the time
  for themselves.</li>

  <li>Have some notifications that run at specific times relative
  to the real world, and others that just run "periodically" -- the
  period ones would keep ticking away across statedumps, skipping
  all the ones from the MUD's lost time. The real-world ones would
  be delivered at the right times, but any that would have happened
  when the MUD was down would all happen at once right after it
  came back up, probably passing a "late" flag to say that they
  hadn't happened at the correct real-world time. This is a hybrid
  between the first approach and the second one.</li>
</ul>

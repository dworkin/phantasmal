<h3>Regarding Copyrights...</h3>

<p>
  Copyright law is actually rather convoluted.  The following is taken
  from the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">U.S. Copyright
  Office</a> website regarding <a
  href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/circs/circ1.html#hlc">How Long
  Copyright Protection Endures</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><cite><b>Works Originally Created and Published or Registered
Before January 1, 1978</b></cite> </p>

<p><cite>Under the law in effect before 1978, copyright was secured
  either on the date a work was published with a copyright notice or
  on the date of registration if the work was registered in
  unpublished form. In either case, the copyright endured for a first
  term of 28 years from the date it was secured. During the last
  (28th) year of the first term, the copyright was eligible for
  renewal. The Copyright Act of 1976 extended the renewal term from 28
  to 47 years for copyrights that were subsisting on January 1, 1978,
  or for pre-1978 copyrights restored under the Uruguay Round
  Agreements Act (URAA), making these works eligible for a total term
  of protection of 75 years. Public Law 105-298, enacted on October
  27, 1998, further extended the renewal term of copyrights <i>still
  subsisting on that date</i> by an additional 20 years, providing for
  a renewal term of 67 years and a total term of protection of 95
  years.  <i>(Italics added.)</i></cite> </p>

<p>
  Since those stories published in 1922 and earlier were no longer
  under copyright when Public Law 105-298 was passed in 1998, they
  remain public domain.  Regarding his stories published after 1922,
  S. T. Joshi's biography of Lovecraft contains several very
  interesting comments (pages 640-641).
</p>

<p>
  Joshi concludes that most, if not all, of his works are in the
  public domain. After Lovecraft's death, his copyrights would have
  belonged to the only surviving heir appointed in his will of 1912,
  his Aunt Annie Gamwell.  She died four years later, and the
  copyrights then devolved to two of her descendants, Ethel Phillips
  Morrish and Edna Lewis.  They in turn signed a document (the
  &quot;Morrish-Lewis gift&quot;) allowing Arkham House to publish all
  his works, but apparently not granting them the copyrights. For a
  time, Derleth claimed that the copyrights on the anthologies Arkham
  House published applied to the stories themselves, which is
  manifestly not the case.
</p>

<p>
  The other route by which the copyrights could have been acquired by
  Arkham House is from <i>Weird Tales</i>.  On October 9, 1947,
  Derleth purchased &quot;all rights&quot; from <i>Weird Tales</i>, but even
  this is problematic - by April 1926 (and possibly sooner) Lovecraft had been
  reserving all second printing rights for himself<sup>1</sup>, so on
  those stories, <i>Weird Tales</i> didn't own any rights to sell.  Of
  the thirteen stories published in <i>Weird Tales</i> before 1926,
  seven had already been published in amateur journals, and were
  thereby in the public domain before <i>Weird Tales</i> printed them;
  that leaves only six<sup>2</sup> that <i>Weird Tales</i> actually
  owned rights to.  However, repeated searches of the Library of
  Congress have failed to yield any evidence that the copyrights were
  renewed after 28 years - <em>thereby allowing the stories to fall
  into the public domain by operation of law.</em>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>

<li> 1 &mdash; The original contracts apparently no longer exist, but
there is considerable circumstantial evidence to support this.  See
page 641 of S. T. Joshi's &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: A Life&quot; for more
information. </li>

<li> 2 &mdash; According to S. T. Joshi.  I can't figure out which six
he means - certainly, &quot;The Temple&quot;, &quot;The
Moon-Bog&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;He&quot; were
accepted by <i>Weird Tales</i> before April 1926. They may have owned
second rights to &quot;The Horror at Red Hook&quot; as well, as I am
not sure when this was accepted.  The fact that Wright (editor of
<i>Weird Tales</i>) required Lovecraft's permission to add his name to
the list of plaintifs in a copyright violation suit in 1929 involving
this story indicates to me that Lovecraft owned the second rights.

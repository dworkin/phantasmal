  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Actions and Events in MUDs </h3>

  <p>
    Imagine a 'perfect' MUD, one that handles multiple languages,
    differing perceptions and event grouping, including everything
    that <a href="Visibility.html">the Visibility</a> document
    mentions, and does it all seamlessly and flawlessly.  Let's
    describe what it actually does and start assigning some names to
    components.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are <em>instant</em> events going on all the time.
    <em>Instant</em> events are anything that can echo text to a
    player.  For example, if somebody says something in a room, that's
    a simple <em>instant</em> event.  If a cannon fires, or a man in a
    suit enters the room, those are also <em>instant</em> events.  The
    text that is displayed may be different for different players.  In
    some cases no text may happen at all.  If no players' characters
    are in the room, or the event is too subtle for them to perceive,
    or if the event gets grouped with other events and echoed later,
    then no text will be displayed for the event.  Different text will
    be sent to different players if the players speak different
    languages, and perhaps if the characters have different levels of
    some specific perception skill.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some events will have multiple components -- an obvious component
    and a hidden one, for instance, or components for multiple
    different senses such as hearing and sight.  The player will
    receive different text in different circumstances for these
    events, and our perfect MUD will group the various components into
    a potentially smaller number of pieces of text.  The cannon
    firing, despite the hearing and smell components, can still all be
    grouped together as &quot;the cannon fires&quot;.  Sets of events
    that are grouped together, and all go off together from the same
    trigger, are called Composite Events.  They are the easiest kind
    of events to combine into less text since they are already lumped
    together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every event will consist of some pieces of player-perceivable
    markup (PPM).  A piece of PPM can appear differently to a
    character depending on skills known, light level, and other
    factors described <a href="Visibility.html">here</a>.
    Traditionally, <em>instant</em> events in MUDs consist of one
    chunk of PPM each for &quot;to actor&quot;, &quot;to victim&quot;,
    possibly &quot;to self&quot; for reflexive verbs, and &quot;to
    others&quot;.  Specific multi-targeted events might have more, and
    untargeted events will have fewer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every PPM will effectively consist of a set of Phrases.  A Phrase
    (in Phantasmal) is a string which can appear differently to
    different players, but not usually to different characters.  A
    Phrase can often translate itself into different languages, so it
    will appear differently to a player who has requested an English
    interface than one who asks to view the MUD in Spanish.  It may
    also contain simple markup like bold, italics, or color codes,
    which are individually translated by different players' terminals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal doesn't yet support a separate PPM object, though it
    probably should.  And it should name it something snappier :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    Each <em>instant</em> action will also carry information about
    what sense it occurs in (sight, sound, taste, touch, vibration,
    infrared, ESP, etc).  This may be combined with information about
    what skills are required to perceive the event.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Timed</em> events are, in effect, scripted arrangements of
    <em>instant</em> actions.  A <em>timed</em> event is an action
    that conceptually occurs over a significant period of time without
    changing.  A buzzing sound, the sharpening of a blade, the smell
    of banana leaves and an army shuffling down a muddy slope could
    all be represented as <em>timed</em> events.  The common factor is
    that each of these takes a nonzero period of time within the MUD.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Timed</em> events consist of an <em>instant</em> event to
    begin, another for people coming into range (walking into a room
    with the sound, for instance, or coming into view of the muddy
    slope), another for when the event stops, another for when you exit
    its field of influence and a final event for when it is
    interrupted.  Thus, for the buzzing sound:
  </p>

<pre>
  > north
  You enter the aviary.
  You hear a buzzing sound here.
  > put in earplugs
  You put in earplugs.
  The buzzing sound is no longer audible.
  > remove earplugs
  You remove your earplugs.
  You hear a buzzing sound here.
  > south
  You head south.
  The buzzing sound is no longer audible.
  You enter the Boring Room.  You should leave north.
  > north
  You enter the aviary.
  You hear a buzzing sound here.
  > listen
  There's a buzzing sound here.  It might be coming from some bushes.
  > stomp on bee
  You stomp on the bee hidden in the bushes.
  The buzzing sound stops abruptly.
</pre>

  <p>
    The Continuing Action may have different 'ending' events depending
    on how it finishes.  For instance, the action of drawing a sword
    might be an event designed to allow for interruption:
  </p>

<pre>
  > draw sword
  You draw your sword with a flourish.
  > sheathe sword
  You do.
  Odin enters.
  > draw sword
  You reach for your sword.
  Quick as a flame, Odin wields his spear.
  You draw your sword with a flourish.
</pre>

  <p>
    Note that the sword-drawing event has no starting sub-event (or
    else that event is silent).  The event says that you draw your
    sword if the action completes successfully, but says that you
    reach for your sword if it's interrupted.
  </p>

  <p>
    An example of a complex action with several senses:
  </p>

<pre>
  An explosion rocks the hall, the first of many.  It shakes you
  down to your toes.
  > close eyes
  You hear an enormous "boom!" and smell smoke and brimstone.  You are
  shaken down to your toes.
  > hold nose
  You hear an enormous "boom!".  You are shaken down to your toes.
  > curl up in a ball on the floor
  You hear yet another enormous "boom!".  You smell smoke and brimstone.
  > am I holding my nose?
  No, your arms are around your knees.

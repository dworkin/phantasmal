    <h3 align="center"> Class Heirarchy for Phantasmal </h3>

    <font size="4">

    <p>
      Phantasmal will eventually (I hope) have a multiple-inheritance
      class heirarchy of objects, which may inherit properties from
      each other.  An object will by default allow its parent class to
      define most of its properties, but may override specific properties
      that are important to the class (such as default volume, weight, etc).
      The object will have a Primary parent class, the first on the
      inheritance list, from which such properties are inherited.  To
      inherit a numerical property from a non-Primary parent, it must
      be overridden.  Some properties, like lists of nouns and adjectives,
      are inherited by merging from all parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      The class heirarchy is an important way to categorize player
      perception.  Any given object may require particular skills or
      properties on the player's part to recognize.  For instance,
      a Chinese vase might not be recognizable without some knowledge of
      China, and would thus default entirely to appearing as a vase to
      a player without such lore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Object Grouping would also work into the Class Heirarchy -- every
      object type could be marked as a Grouping, perhaps with a scale
      factor to tell how preferentially it should be chosen.  Thus, a
      very specific group like &quot;scimitar&quot; would have a high
      scale factor and be chosen readily, while a vaguer description like
      &quot;farm equipment&quot; would be chosen less often.

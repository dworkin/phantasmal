<h1>Using Phantasmal</h1>

<p>So you've downloaded Phantasmal and gotten it up and running.
You're reasonably well-versed in DGD and the Kernel MUDLib <a href=
"../DGD/index.html">(right?)</a>. Now it's time to do a little
more. You want to know if Phantasmal is for you. Should you use it
by itself? Should you build on it?</p>

<p>Yes, of course you should (&lt;grin&gt;). And you should submit
your changes to the author or put them up for download as yet
another public domain library. But first, you should build some
stuff with Phantasmal to get the hang of how to do it.</p>

<p>We expect that most Phantasmal games (including Sea of Night)
will keep these commands basically the same as these tutorials, but
may restrict who gets to use particular commands. So if you've just
been made a builder, don't expect the "%shutdown" command to work,
necessarily. Your MUD may claim there's no such thing when you try
it, even if you can find it in the online help.</p>

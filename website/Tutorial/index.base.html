<h1>Using Phantasmal</h1>

<p>So you've downloaded Phantasmal and gotten it up and running. You're
reasonably well-versed in DGD and the Kernel MUDLib <a href=
"../DGD/index.html">(right?)</a>. Now it's time to do a
little more. You want to know if Phantasmal is for you. Should you use
it by itself? Should you build on it?</p>

<p>Yes, of course you should (&lt;grin&gt;). And you should submit your
changes to the author or put them up for download as yet another public
domain library. But first, you should build some stuff with Phantasmal
to get the hang of how to do it.</p>

<p>We expect that most Phantasmal games (including Sea of Night) will
keep these commands basically the same as these tutorials, but may
restrict who gets to use particular commands. So if you've just been
made a builder, don't expect the "%shutdown" command to work,
necessarily. Your MUD may claim there's no such thing when you try it,
even if you can find it in the online help.</p>

<h2>Access, Resources and Quotas</h2>

<h3>Admin Access and Path Permissions</h3>

<p>Remember that incantation you did way back when, the one you used to
give you administrator character his power as a Mighty Admin? Now we'll
get around to letting you know how that worked and what similar things
you can do.</p>

<p>Phantasmal has its roots in the Kernel Library, and nowhere is that
more obvious than in these commands right here. There's a full
permissions system for this stuff that's <i>entirely separate</i> from
the way Phantasmal does most of what it does, and people who are
seriously privileged under this system have full power to do absolutely
anything to the MUD if they're so inclined. That's a generalization, but
basically it's very hard to defend your Phantasmal MUD against somebody
with these privileges -- it's just not designed for it. Once somebody
can run arbitrary code, and once they can compile objects inside the
main body of your MUD, a sufficiently clever attacker will be able to do
weird and nasty stuff to your MUD in one way or another.</p>

<p>So, let's show you how to give people this power, and what you can do
to understand it.</p>

<p>First, you should learn how to find out who can do what, and who
exists in your MUD. The <b>%access</b> command is a fine way to
determine what permissions somebody has. Just type "%access AdminName"
and it'll tell you what file access you've given them. That file access
takes the form of paths and types. For instance, awhile back when you
typed "%grant SomeIdiot / full", what you did was to give them full
(that's read/write plus admin) access to the root directory -- in other
words, full power to do anything to any file. And yes, that would be why
it's hard to stop them from hurting your MUD if they so choose.</p>

<p>There are also global areas that anybody can read. That's important
for things like the ROOM object that other people need to be able to
inherit. So if you type "%access global" in Phantasmal, you'll find that
the "/usr/common" directory is globally readable. That's where we store
stuff like ROOM and OBJECT so it has to be globally readable.</p>

<p>The Kernel Library (and thus Phantasmal) stores a list of everybody
that has any access that it cares about. Before you can have any
specific access, you have to be on The List. The way to put somebody on
The List is to type "%grant WhoEverTheyAre access". To take them off the
list, just type "%ungrant WhoEverTheyAre access".</p>

<p>So <b>%access</b> tells you what they can play with. How do you
change it? <b>%grant</b> and <b>%ungrant</b> again, it turns out. The
syntax for <b>%grant</b> is "%grant AdminName &lt;path&gt;
&lt;access&gt;". Path is just the path, and AdminName is granted the
listed access to that path and all subdirectories (with some specific
exceptions that the Kernel Library provides). Access is one of: read,
write, full. Full means both read and write, but also administrative
access to do other things. The <b>%ungrant</b> command has the same
syntax, but does the opposite -- it removes access to that path.</p>

<h3>Quotas and Resources</h3>

<p>There are certain types of resources that the Kernel MUDLib tracks
and limits. You can only use so much of any one of them before it stops
giving you any more. The <b>%quota</b> and <b>%rsrc</b> commands let you
play with them.</p>

<p>The <b>%rsrc</b> command, typed by itself, will show you the total
quota and usage of every resource for everybody in the MUD. It may look
like this:</p>
<pre>
resources                usage          max  decay  period
----------------+-------------+------------+------+---------
callouts                     1           -1
create stack                 0            5
create ticks                 0        10000
editors                      0           -1
events                       0           -1
filequota                 1167           -1
objects                    200           -1
stack                        0           50
tick usage             3589379           -1    10% per hour
ticks                        0       250000
</pre>

<p>The usage column gives the amount currently in use. The max column
tells you the total limit, and the decay column lets you know how fast
usage of that resource decays. On the left, of course, are the resource
names. Let's look at one individually. Go ahead and type "%rsrc tick
usage". You'll see something like this:</p>
<pre>
owner                    usage          max  decay  period
----------------+-------------+------------+------+---------
Ecru                         0           -1    10% per hour
System                     308           -1    10% per hour
admin                        0           -1    10% per hour
angelbob                101333           -1    10% per hour
common                 3436295           -1    10% per hour
thedarque                    0           -1    10% per hour
    </pre>

<p>Nifty, no? That breaks the total down into who is using what, and
their individual limits. And <b>%rsrc</b> can also be used to set the
total limit, by typing "%rsrc &lt;rsrc name&gt; &lt;new limit&gt;".
That's pretty cool. Now let's hit our final command and see what
<b>%quota</b> can do.</p>

<p>While <b>%rsrc</b> showed us a lot about the overall usage of
resources for everybody, <b>%quota</b> is more selective. Type it by
itself to see your usage of each resource, kinda like "%rsrc YourName"
would do. Type it with an admin's name to see that admin's usage of
various resources -- "%quota SomeIdiot". To see one specific resource
for one specific admin, type "%quota AdminName &lt;resource name&gt;",
such as "%quota angelbob tick usage" or "%quota angelbob events". And
finally, you can set a new quota for an admin by typing "%quota
AdminName &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;new limit&gt;". Note that -1 means
"unlimited" for most resources, which can be a useful thing.</p>

<p>You got this far and you're still actually reading? Man, you're
really delving. We don't have much more we can show you. But go ahead
and hit any <a href="../index.html">tutorials</a> you haven't already
finished. Below is a listing of various resources and what they mean to
the Kernel MUDLib. If you micromanage this stuff, you're ahead of
me.</p>
<hr />

<ul>
  <li>callouts - this is the number of call_out functions that are or
  may be active at once.</li>

  <li>create stack - this is the amount of stack space the Kernel
  Library wants available before it will create a new object</li>

  <li>create ticks - this is the number of ticks the Kernel Library
  wants available before it will create a new object</li>

  <li>editors - this is the number of editor instances that may be open
  and active at once.</li>

  <li>events - the Kernel Library can notify subscriber lists of events,
  which Phantasmal doesn't currently bother with. This is the number of
  available/possible events.</li>

  <li>filequota - You only get a certain number of bytes of storage to
  play with in your directory (unless this is set to -1). This is how
  much you're currently using, or your maximum limit.</li>

  <li>objects - each person has a maximum number of allowed objects
  (unless this is set to -1).</li>

  <li>stack - this is the amount of stack space remaining to be
  used</li>

  <li>tick usage - this is the number of ticks that have already been
  used. Every hour it decreases by 10% in the default
  configuration.</li>

  <li>ticks - this is the number of ticks remaining to be used</li>
</ul>

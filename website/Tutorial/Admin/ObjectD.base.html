<h2>Querying ObjectD</h2>

<p>I take it you're running low on tutorials. Why else would you be
figuring out how to play with Phantasmal's ObjectD? Apparently
you're bored or intrigued enough to find out how to play with
extremely low-level gritty details. Fair enough, I just document
this stuff.</p>

<p>You'll need a good working grasp of how inheritance and upgrades
work in the <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD/Kernel/">Kernel Library</a>
-- Phantasmal is based on it, and uses the same semantics for
inheritance. You'll also need to know roughly what an object
manager is and how it works. You'll find more than you ever wanted
to know in the mailing list archives. Let's jump right in, shall
we?</p>

<p>You'll need to find an object with the <b>%od_report</b>
command. One way to do that is to come up with an object you know
exists. These are entirely different from the kind of object you
make with <b>@make_portable</b> or <b>@new_room</b>. Instead,
they're LPC programs. So you could start by saying "%od_report
/usr/System/initd". That'd work. You might see:</p>
<pre>
Clonable
  0 clones exist
Name: /usr/System/initd
Index: 19
Comp_time: Fri Mar 14 07:17:17 2003
No previous issue
Inherits from: #50 #52
Also depends on: /include/kernel/kernel.h /include/config.h
/include/kernel/access.h /include/kernel/rsrc.h /include/kernel/version.h
/include/type.h /include/config.h /include/log.h
</pre>

<p>Confusing. That top line says that it's Clonable instead of
Inheritable, so an object and not a library. It has no current
clones, though. The Name is the object name, which you already knew
because you typed it. The "index" is also referred to as the Issue,
and tells what compiled version you're looking at. The same object
could exist in many different ways on the same running MUD just as
long as somebody inherited from them once and is thus still
pointing to them, which keeps them around.</p>

<p>The Comp_time is just when it was compiled. No black magic
there. "No previous issue" is what it says if your ObjectD isn't
tracking more than one version of this object. It might otherwise
mention a previous issue by number, which you could then examine
with <b>%od_report</b>. It <i>does</i> mention that it inherits
from some objects, #50 and #52. We'll look at one of them in a
minute. And then it "also depends on" files like
/include/kernel/kernel.h. Usually this means that it includes them
from its source file.</p>

<p>So if we want to find out what object #50 is, we'll type
"%od_report #50". Go ahead. I get:</p>
<pre>
Inheritable
Name: /kernel/lib/api/access
Index: 50
Comp_time: Fri Mar 14 07:17:17 2003
No previous issue
Inherits from:
Its children are: #56 #19 #15 #67 #68 #69
Also depends on: /include/kernel/kernel.h /include/config.h /include/kernel/access.h
</pre>

<p>Note that this one is inheritable. The previous object inherited
from it, so it better be. It's /kernel/lib/api/access, which seems
a pretty reasonable parent for /usr/System/initd. It also has no
previous issue. It inherits from nobody, but it has lots of
children, including #19. That's good, because #19 is
/usr/System/initd, so it'd better list that as a child.</p>

<p>There's only one other command that directly queries the
ObjectD, and that's <b>%list_dest</b>. Just type it by itself. If
you get output like this:</p>
<pre>
Objects:
    
</pre>

<p>Then nothing is on the list. If you see names afterward then it
means there's some object whose most recent issue is destructed.
The <b>%od_report</b> command works just fine on destructed objects
and issue numbers, so you can find out all about it.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Querying ObjectD</h2>

<p>I take it you're running low on tutorials. Why else would you be
figuring out how to play with Phantasmal's ObjectD? Apparently you're
bored or intrigued enough to find out how to play with extremely
low-level gritty details. Fair enough, I just document this stuff.</p>

<p>You'll need a good working grasp of how inheritance and upgrades work
in the <a href="http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD/Kernel/">Kernel
Library</a> -- Phantasmal is based on it, and uses the same semantics
for inheritance. You'll also need to know roughly what an object manager
is and how it works. You'll find more than you ever wanted to know in
the mailing list archives. Let's jump right in, shall we?</p>

<p>You'll need to find an object with the <b>%od_report</b> command. One
way to do that is to come up with an object you know exists. These are
entirely different from the kind of object you make with
<b>@make_portable</b> or <b>@new_room</b>. Instead, they're LPC
programs. So you could start by saying "%od_report /usr/System/initd".
That'd work. You might see:</p>
<pre>
Clonable
  0 clones exist
Name: /usr/System/initd
Index: 19
Comp_time: Fri Mar 14 07:17:17 2003
No previous issue
Inherits from: #50 #52
Also depends on: /include/kernel/kernel.h /include/config.h
/include/kernel/access.h /include/kernel/rsrc.h /include/kernel/version.h
/include/type.h /include/config.h /include/log.h
</pre>

<p>Confusing. That top line says that it's Clonable instead of
Inheritable, so an object and not a library. It has no current clones,
though. The Name is the object name, which you already knew because you
typed it. The "index" is also referred to as the Issue, and tells what
compiled version you're looking at. The same object could exist in many
different ways on the same running MUD just as long as somebody
inherited from them once and is thus still pointing to them, which keeps
them around.</p>

<p>The Comp_time is just when it was compiled. No black magic there. "No
previous issue" is what it says if your ObjectD isn't tracking more than
one version of this object. It might otherwise mention a previous issue
by number, which you could then examine with <b>%od_report</b>. It
<i>does</i> mention that it inherits from some objects, #50 and #52.
We'll look at one of them in a minute. And then it "also depends on"
files like /include/kernel/kernel.h. Usually this means that it includes
them from its source file.</p>

<p>So if we want to find out what object #50 is, we'll type "%od_report
#50". Go ahead. I get:</p>
<pre>
Inheritable
Name: /kernel/lib/api/access
Index: 50
Comp_time: Fri Mar 14 07:17:17 2003
No previous issue
Inherits from:
Its children are: #56 #19 #15 #67 #68 #69
Also depends on: /include/kernel/kernel.h /include/config.h /include/kernel/access.h
</pre>

<p>Note that this one is inheritable. The previous object inherited from
it, so it better be. It's /kernel/lib/api/access, which seems a pretty
reasonable parent for /usr/System/initd. It also has no previous issue.
It inherits from nobody, but it has lots of children, including #19.
That's good, because #19 is /usr/System/initd, so it'd better list that
as a child.</p>

<p>There's only one other command that directly queries the ObjectD, and
that's <b>%list_dest</b>. Just type it by itself. If you get output like
this:</p>
<pre>
Objects:
    </pre>

<p>Then nothing is on the list. If you see names afterward then it means
there's some object whose most recent issue is destructed. The
<b>%od_report</b> command works just fine on destructed objects and
issue numbers, so you can find out all about it.</p>

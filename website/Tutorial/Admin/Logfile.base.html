<h2>The System Logfile</h2>

<p>Your copy of Phantasmal has a logfile. Yes, that's right,
<i>yours</i> -- there's no getting around it. None! So what are you
going to do about it?</p>

<p>If I were you, I'd learn about it. This tutorial can help. First
you'll need to find it. Check out "/log/System.log" first, that's
the default location. If it's not there you'll just have to check
the "/include/config" file for something that looks like a logfile.
Have a look in your logfile. If you've been ignoring it up until
now, it's probably got a lot of random stuff in it. Mmm... Stuff.
You may even remember specific errors you've gotten and see them
there.</p>

<p>You may want to go ahead and remove the old logfile or back it
up, just so you don't have to scroll past all the old stuff. So do
that now if you're gonna. Then, at the MUD command line and with an
administrator character, type something like "%log YOUR AD HERE,
ONLY $99.99!". Now have a look in the logfile again.</p>

<p>Those spamming bastards! They're everywhere! Even in your
logfile. No, I'm being silly. That is (of course) the message you
just typed, in the logfile, with a little header above it. The
header tells you who typed it, what file the message came from and
various things like that.</p>

<p>It's kind of inconvenient to have to look at the logfile in the
terminal window and type the MUD commands from the MUD window,
isn't it? You can view the logfile more easily by subscribing to
the Logfile channel. You're an administrator, you can do that. Go
ahead and type "channels", which will show you your available
channels. Note that both the <b>Logfile</b> and <b>Error</b>
channels are available. I highly recommend subscribing to one or
the other, but not both. Any error will also make it into the
logfile and you probably don't want to see it twice (three times in
some cases).</p>

<p>Go ahead and subscribe to the logfile with a command like
"channels Logfile on". The try some test-logging... Type "%log
d00dz! 37337 \/\/AR3Z 5173 @ 127.0.0.1!". Bastards! Now they even
spam your terminal with their filth! You should bring down their
vile warez site with a denial-of-service attack!</p>

<p>But seriously, now you can tell that you're seeing what gets
written to the logfile as it gets written. Go you! You can
subscribe to only certain notification levels if you prefer.
There's a special syntax for subscribing to channels that only
administrators get -- check the usage information. To subscribe to
errors only, for instance, you can type "channels logfile on err".
You may need to unsubscribe and resubscribe to do this, though.</p>

<p>The error channel doesn't currently respect the level setting.
All errors are considered equal severity, so if you subscribe to
the error channel you see all of them. Still, it can be very
useful. Note: errors that are caught with a catch{} construct in
the code don't show up on the error channel or in the logfile.
Caught errors are considered routine so you don't want them
cluttering up your log.</p>

<p>There's one more nifty command to play with --
<b>%log_subscribe</b>. It lets you choose what goes into the
logfile and what doesn't. Every log message has a severity like
"verbose", "normal", "warning", "error" and "fatal". There are
equivalent numbers for the various severities. With
<b>%log_subscribe</b> you can choose, for each file, what severity
of error gets written to the logfile. This may not affect what
winds up on the Logfile channel, though. The syntax for
<b>%log_subscribe</b> is: "%log_subscribe &lt;file&gt;
&lt;level&gt;". If you want the settings to persist across
shutdowns, it's currently better to change the
"/data/system/logd_channels.unq" file, which has the same
functionality.</p>

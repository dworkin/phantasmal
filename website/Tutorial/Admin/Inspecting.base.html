@@TITLE Inspecting Your MUD@@

<h2>Inspecting Your Phantasmal-based MUD</h2>

<p>Now that you've got your MUD set up, there's a lot to do and a
lot to learn. Let's see some of what we can see.</p>

<p>The <i>most</i> important thing you can learn is the online help
command. This document assumes you're logged in with an admin
account. Just type "help" by itself and you should see some builder
help. If you don't see anything about building or administration,
your character isn't actually an administrator yet, or you're using
the wrong character.</p>

<p>As a player you probably tried the <b>who</b> command to show
you who was on. The more powerful <b>%who</b> (also called
<b>%people</b>) command will show you everybody you're allowed to
see, and will show you their IP addresses as well. Give it a try.
Just type it by itself on the command line.</p>

<p>A holdover from the Kernel MUDlib is the <b>%status</b> command.
You'll find that it shows you a lot of stuff with very little
explanation. It may look a bit like this:</p>
<pre>
                                          Server:       DGD 1.2.55

             864972 /   1300860 ( 66%)                      2 /   100 (  2%)

Objects:        205 /       500 ( 41%)    Connections:      1 /    40 (  2%)
</pre>

<p>The online help isn't very helpful about this one -- it's low
level nitty-gritty details. So let's hit what's here.</p>

<p>The sector size is how big a given DGD swap sector is. In the
listing above, it's 0.5K, or 512 bytes. In the example, 1394 of
them are being used (that's just under 700K in size), or 68% of the
available sectors. You can change how many are available in the
configuration file you set up for phantasmal, called
"phantasmal.dgd". You may need to increase it periodically as your
MUD grows.</p>

<p>The swap average describes the current swapping behavior and how
many objects are being swapped out to disk. Don't worry too much
about this until your machine makes chugga-chugga-chugga noises.
Even then, you probably mainly just need more sectors available on
disk and in memory.</p>

<p>The memory statistics, listed as static and dynamic, are things
that DGD will ordinarily handle pretty well for itself. If you get
serious weirdness here, you can e-mail the DGD mailing list and
Dworkin, the author of DGD, can probably help you out.</p>

<p>The start time is pretty self-explanatory. It should be when you
started the MUD. The uptime is how long it's been running. The
"server" entry is what version of DGD you're running. The number of
connections (1/40 above) is how many current connections you have
to your MUD (1 above) and how many you can have at most (40
above).</p>

<p>The number of objects is the number of compiled or cloned
objects are currently active in the MUD, and how many it can have
at maximum. If the percentage of used objects gets too large, you
can increase the available number in "phantasmal.dgd". The bigger
your MUD gets, the more objects it's likely to need. If you need to
reduce this in some other way you can use more <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD/DGD_LPC_Ref.html#LightWeightObjs">LWOs</a>
in your MUDLib -- they live in other objects' memory space so they
don't count against this total.</p>

<p>The maximum number of call_outs is also set in "phantasmal.dgd".
It's the number of pending uses of the <b>call_out()</b> kernel
function you can make before it decides you can't have any more.
There are many ways to avoid having too many of these. Phantasmal,
for instance, uses something it calls a TimeD to handle the
call_outs and call many functions from each single call_out
instance.</p>

<p>Now you know the basics of monitoring your MUD's health and
activity. Read more <a href="index.html">tutorials</a>, go ahead
and <a href="../OLC/index.html">build up</a> your MUD some more,
and release it on an unsuspecting public!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Inspecting Your Phantasmal-based MUD </h2>

    <p> Now that you've got your MUD set up, there's a lot to do and
      a lot to learn.  Let's see some of what we can see. </p>

    <p> The <i>most</i> important thing you can learn is the online
      help command.  This document assumes you're logged in with an
      admin account.  Just type &quot;help&quot; by itself and you
      should see some builder help.  If you don't see anything
      about building or administration, your character isn't
      actually an administrator yet, or you're using the wrong
      character. </p>

    <p> As a player you probably tried the <b>who</b> command to show
      you who was on.  The more powerful <b>%who</b> (also called
      <b>%people</b>) command will show you everybody you're allowed
      to see, and will show you their IP addresses as well.  Give
      it a try.  Just type it by itself on the command line.</p>

    <p> A holdover from the Kernel MUDlib is the <b>%status</b>
      command.  You'll find that it shows you a lot of stuff
      with very little explanation.  It may look a bit like this:
    </p>
<pre>
                                          Server:       DGD 1.2.55
------------ Swap device -------------
sectors:       1394 /      2048 ( 68%)    Start time:   Mar 14 07:17:17 2003
sector size:   0.5K            
swap average:  0.21, 0.09                 Uptime:       2 days, 04:39:28

--------------- Memory ---------------    ------------ Callouts ------------
static:      132544 /    256380 ( 52%)    short term:       2         (100%)
dynamic:     732428 /   1044480 ( 70%) +  long term:        0         (  0%) +
             864972 /   1300860 ( 66%)                      2 /   100 (  2%)

Objects:        205 /       500 ( 41%)    Connections:      1 /    40 (  2%)
</pre>
    <p>
      The online help isn't very helpful about this one -- it's low level
      nitty-gritty details.  So let's hit what's here. </p>

    <p> The sector size is how big a given DGD swap sector is.  In the
      listing above, it's 0.5K, or 512 bytes.  In the example, 1394 of
      them are being used (that's just under 700K in size), or 68% of
      the available sectors.  You can change how many are available
      in the configuration file you set up for phantasmal, called
      &quot;phantasmal.dgd&quot;.  You may need to increase it
      periodically as your MUD grows. </p>

    <p> The swap average describes the current swapping behavior and
      how many objects are being swapped out to disk.  Don't worry too
      much about this until your machine makes chugga-chugga-chugga
      noises.  Even then, you probably mainly just need more sectors
      available on disk and in memory. </p>

    <p> The memory statistics, listed as static and dynamic, are things
      that DGD will ordinarily handle pretty well for itself.  If you
      get serious weirdness here, you can e-mail the DGD mailing list
      and Dworkin, the author of DGD, can probably help you out. </p>

    <p> The start time is pretty self-explanatory.  It should be
      when you started the MUD.  The uptime is how long it's been running.
      The &quot;server&quot; entry is what version of DGD you're running.
      The number of connections (1/40 above) is how many current
      connections you have to your MUD (1 above) and how many you can
      have at most (40 above). </p>

    <p> The number of objects is the number of compiled or cloned
      objects are currently active in the MUD, and how many it can
      have at maximum.  If the percentage of used objects gets too
      large, you can increase the available number in
      &quot;phantasmal.dgd&quot;.  The bigger your MUD gets, the more
      objects it's likely to need.  If you need to reduce this in
      some other way you can use more
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD/DGD_LPC_Ref.html#LightWeightObjs">
	LWOs</a> in your MUDLib -- they
      live in other objects' memory space so they don't count against
      this total. </p>

    <p> The maximum number of call_outs is also set in
      &quot;phantasmal.dgd&quot;.  It's the number of pending uses
      of the <b>call_out()</b> kernel function you can make before
      it decides you can't have any more.  There are many ways to
      avoid having too many of these.  Phantasmal, for instance, uses
      something it calls a TimeD to handle the call_outs and call
      many functions from each single call_out instance. </p>

      activity.  Read more <a href="index.html">tutorials</a>,

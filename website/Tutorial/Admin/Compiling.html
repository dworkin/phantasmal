    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Compiling Programs In Your MUD </h2>

    <p> If you're a free spirit that likes to live dangerously then you'll
      want to change your source files and play with them dynamically
      while the MUD is running.  If you're writing features for somebody
      else's MUD and you don't run your own MUD on the same codebase,
      changing things on the fly is pretty much mandatory.  Either way,
      this tutorial will start you on that road. </p>

    <p> Being able to compile or recompile a single program is the most
      basic step, and you'll need the <b>%compile</b> command to do it.
      You can type &quot;%compile /usr/System/initd&quot; to
      recompile the InitD, for instance.  If it succeeds it'll tell
      you so, and if it fails it'll print the error(s) it got when
      trying to compile. </p>

    <p> Recompiling a library is more interesting, and at this point
      I'd recommend using the <b>%full_rebuild</b> command any time
      you modify any library -- better safe than sorry, and it's
      hard to keep track of what needs to be recompiled and
      what already has been.  The <b>%full_rebuild</b> command
      will take care of these things for you.  If you're curious
      what all the fuss is, have a look at the
      <a href="http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD/Kernel"> Kernel Library </a>
      and read the document on Inheritance.  Rather than understanding
      all that, though, you can let <b>%full_rebuild</b> do the
      automated version for you. </p>

    <p> Simply type &quot;%full_rebuild&quot; by itself at the command
      line and you'll see a message that it's rebuilding, eventually
      followed by the word &quot;Done&quot;.  That's if there's no
      errors.  If an error occurs then you'll see the errors printed.
      In that case, not all of the rebuild will happen since it stops at
      the file causing the error. </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center">Upgrading Objects In-Place </h3>

    <p> When you rebuild a program that has instances or clones, or
      even one that you call functions on, you'll be changing its
      behavior.  For instance, recompiling /usr/common/sys/mapd to
      have new code or data will instantly take effect after the
      rebuild, and rebuilding /usr/System/obj/user will immediately
      change the behavior of any network connections to users. </p>

    <p> When you add a data field, it starts uninitialized.  When
      you remove one or change its type, it also goes away or
      becomes uninitialized.  In that case, you may want to run
      a snippet of code to give it a new and more sensible value.
      The obvious way to do that is to put a function called
      &quot;upgraded&quot; in its definition.  The
      &quot;upgraded&quot; function should take a single integer
      varargs argument of type <b>int</b> if the class is cloneable
      and you expect to call the function on clones. </p>

    <p> ObjectD will only call the upgraded function once for each
      program it upgrades.  That means that daemons like MapD and ExitD
      will be able to simply use &quot;upgraded&quot; to update their
      data.  Libraries have no instance data so they're not too likely
      to have problems (though they may cause problems for programs
      that inherit them!), but clonable objects may have more to
      worry about.  Since each clone has instance data, it may be
      necessary to notify each clone of the upgrade.  Given how long
      it can take to call &quot;upgraded&quot; on each and every
      clone, the ObjectD doesn't do this.  So your program may need
      to perform an operation on every current clone when you upgrade
      its code and data members. </p>

    <p> One way to avoid this problem is to have an initialization
      flag in the object, one you've just added.  Then you can
      initialize the new data when you perform some common operation
      on the object and set the flag as well.  This wastes a little
      space for the flag, and a little time when checking for it
      (remember, the code that checks for the flag is there forever,
      it's just that you only initialize once).  But it can be
      preferable to having to notify all the clones of your object.
    </p>

    <p> As a final note:  if your object has an &quot;upgrading&quot;
      function, that function will be called before the object is
      recompiled.  It uses the original code, <b>not</b> the new
      code after the recompile.  The &quot;upgraded&quot; function
      uses the new, post-recompile code.  It's important to keep
      track of this in some way.  In Phantasmal, currently we just
      always use &quot;upgraded&quot; so that we know the code we're
      using is the latest revision and we don't have to worry about
      whether the code in &quot;upgrading&quot; did the right thing.
      One can certainly imagine cases where the upgrade system might
      use &quot;upgrading&quot;, though -- for instance, classes that
      can read and write themselves to UNQ might save an UNQ version
      of themselves with &quot;upgrading&quot; and reload from it
      with &quot;upgraded&quot;, which would nicely avoid problems
      when changing data types. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center"> Starting and Stopping Your MUD </h2>

    <p> Starting your MUD is something you should already have done.
      You saw how to make the &quot;phantasmal.dgd&quot; configuration
      file, and you've probably read enough DGD documentation to know
      how to start with that from a statedump file (<i>haven't</i> you?).
      So let's see about stopping the MUD cleanly, and about making
      those statedump files. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal stores its data in two primary ways between restarts.
      Those ways are statedump files and UNQ files.  Let's start with
      statedumps because they're easier. </p>

    <p> You can use the <b>%swapout</b> command to swap out all
      objects.  This
      makes sure your statedump file is up-to-date, though you're
      still better off typing &quot;%statedump&quot; instead.  In
      fact, by and large, we don't recommend the <b>%swapout</b>
      command for anything but debugging. </p>

    <p> If you want to swap out to the swapfile and make sure you
      get the very latest of everything, you probably want to
      use <b>%reboot</b>, which will swap everything to the
      swapfile and then shut your MUD down.  This is the best way
      to be sure of preserving everything since the swapfile is
      all-inclusive.  All hail DGD! </p>

    <p> In addition to the swapfile you have the UNQ data files.
      The ones for most in-game objects live under the
      &quot;/data/object/&quot; directory.  You'll want to use
      them to hand-edit files, to do certain kinds of upgrades,
      to view files directly in your text editor, and perhaps
      for more reasons as well.  These are much more like
      traditional MUD area and object files. </p>

    <p> You can write them out with <b>%datadump</b>, also
      simply called <b>%save</b>.  You can write to a backup
      set of filenames with <b>%safesave</b> -- your MUD
      won't automatically overwrite these files on shutdown,
      and they won't be removed or destroyed normally.  Basically,
      it's one more way to make a backup. </p>

    <p> You can write to those files and shut the MUD down by
      typing &quot;%shutdown&quot;.  That updates your UNQ files
      but not your statedump.  It's the most conservative way
      to shut the MUD down, and the least amenable to long
      uptimes.  It also gives you the best chance of recovery
      if anything goes wrong, and will fix things like leaked
      memory or resources -- which can be a serious problem on
      a persistent MUD. </p>

    <p> What now?  You could read more <a
      href="../index.html">tutorials</a>.  It's not like there's any
      shortage.  Or you could read the extended remix of how
      statedumps are different from UNQfiles, which is mostly
      reproduced below.  This is originally taken from the SourceForge
      Developer Forum in November of 2002, and is a discussion mainly
      between me (Angelbob, or Noah Gibbs), Keith Dunwoody and sarak
      (Neil McBride).
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p style="color: green">Neil wrote (among other things):</p>

    <p>It started me asking the question that if it's a persistant mud
      using the DGD driver, why do we need to convert the data in the
      objects into UNQ to save onto disk? The UNQ format is good for
      archtypes so we can make copies or inherit from one (if that's
      possible in that format) but it seems we're doing something we don't
      need to if we're writing the data from objects down in UNQ format.
    </p>

    <p> DGD saves the state and everybody's happy :) Perhaps a UNQ
      save could be done for a version change of DGD where the old dump
      file becomes unusable?</p>

    <p> Along the same lines I thought that development could happen
      in much the same way, yet I still need to think more on that to
      get the idea clear in my head. </p>

    <p> Sorry for the vagueness, but this is just popping into my
      head now so I thought I'd write it down somewhere before I
      forgot it all again :p </p>

    <p> Anyway, there's my idea. We use UNQ for archtypes and DGD's
      dump feature for the ongoing world. Other than the 'difficult for
      people unfamiliar with it', what other problems would this have? </p>

    <hr />

    <p style="color: green">Noah replied:</p>

    <p> In theory, no problem at all. This is roughly what Skotos does
      with their stuff (using XML, not UNQ, and pretty much only for
      ur-object import/export). It can definitely be done. </p>

    <p>What it costs Phantasmal specifically is the way I currently do
      upgrades and stuff. In a system that dynamic, you have to be ready
      to write on-the-fly translators between all the in-memory data
      formats as they change. For instance, at one point I changed the
      helpfile structures to use a different set of fields. In the
      current system I just made the new fields optional in the UNQ
      loader (it filled in default values), shutdown and started back
      up. Hey, presto, everything was done with the bright shiny new
      fields. </p>

    <p> You could do that in a running system -- for instance, the
      HELPD will currently reload all entries every time the upgrade()
      command is called. Unfortunately you have to do it a little more
      carefully because upgrade() runs with the old code, not the new
      code. This will be fixed eventually, probably by adding *another*
      upgrade-type function that is compiled and then run later as part
      of another thread. You have to do it as another thread because the
      actual recompile takes place after the current thread has entirely
      completed. It's all a little touch-and-go. </p>

    <p> Now you could, for every system, just have an easy way to
      reload from UNQ just for that system like the HELPD above if you
      do it carefully or if upgraded() worked right. But then you
      quickly get to the same point, or you do far more work, or both.
    </p>

    <p> For instance, say you add new fields to objects. You need to
      write code to go through all existing objects and give them good
      default values. Or, you could reload all your archetypes from
      UNQ. This would leave all your instances in place, but require
      more code to make sure you updated all your instances and all your
      archetypes and never got any errors while it was halfway done. </p>

    <p> There's another question: how do you deal with loss of data?
      What if some admin writes a bad command and you lose location data
      for a random 1% of all objects in the game, and you need to
      restore from old backup files? UNQ is a pretty simple format to
      play with (in Perl, for instance). DGD dumpfiles are not. You can
      extract specific little chunks of an UNQ file easily, or just only
      use the ones you care about (just roomfile.unq, and only certain
      rooms). That's much harder when you've got a full memory dump from
      a running program. </p>

    <p> Skotos handles this with very regular backups of old
      dumpfiles, and if something goes catastrophically wrong they can
      pick through the in-memory stuff with their debugging tools, or
      through the dumpfile similarly, and it's *very* labor-intensive. I
      happen to like the idea of having easily-modifiable and
      easily-parsable backups. </p>

    <p> The other thing is: since your modifiable objects, your
      instances, have to have basically everything that your archetypes
      do, and you need to be able to read and write your archetypes as
      UNQ, you've already done 99% of the work to save your
      instances. If you want to have a way to load or save just the
      archetypes, go through, do an object save and only save objects
      with the archetype flag set. Not a big deal. If you look at the
      %save_objects command, it's already able to do a &quot;picky
      save&quot;, it's just that you supply the object numbers instead
      of it going through and picking out archetypes for itself. An
      &quot;%archetype_save&quot; command or &quot;%save_objects
      archetypes&quot; or something would be pretty easy to do. </p>

    <p> So why does Skotos do it that way? Because some of their
      development servers have been running off the same statefiles,
      without a reboot, since something like 1997, or had when they made
      that old post to the DGD mailing list :-) They're a real
      commercial outfit and they *really* care about uptime. I'm a
      callous bastard who reboots when he feels like it, and as long as
      it's possible for people with the drive of Skotos to do what they
      do based on Phantasmal, I feel no compulsion to do the same thing
      for myself. I'm quite happy announcing that people should stop
      doing stuff they care about, dumping all the data to UNQ, then
      rebooting and reloading from UNQ. It means I can dump all the old
      memory leaks and inconsistencies easily, and it means I can
      upgrade Phantasmal without having to convert all the old in-memory
      data. As far as I'm concerned, yay for reboots :-P </p>

    <p> I'm exaggerating, but you see my point. Doing it
      &quot;right&quot;, the way you suggest, winds up being far more
      labor-intensive in the long run. There's nothing deeply wrong with
      that, but it means that you're trading ease of development for
      uptime. That's great in a mature, running system but it sucks for
      something that isn't really even beta-test level yet, like
      Phantasmal. </p>

    <p> And think about it, do we really want to accompany every
      significant CVS checkin with a full set of code to do any
      necessary upgrades on a running server? Do you know what a bitch
      that can be to test properly? And you'll also need to include
      instructions on how to use it since some things would be
      basically: do a %full_rebuild. Load this specific new CVS
      file. Rebuild again. Load the latest CVS. Rebuild again. </p>

    <p> Seriously. Try it some time. Incremental updates are harder
      than they appear, and only part of the problem is really
      fixable. Also, you can't upgrade to the current version from any
      past version unless you know which one, so taking a running MUD
      from a really old Phantasmal version to the current one would
      probably require them to do 30 or more updates, each one where
      they upgrade their running MUD off old CVS checkins in specific
      ways... Or else every upgrade code, forever, will have to be able
      to figure out what older version it's upgrading from and do it
      right. And that is called quadratic increase in testing effort --
      every version you release makes every new version harder to test
      by a constant amount. Your total testing time is O(V^2) in the
      number of versions. Not good. </p>

    <p style="color: green">Keith wrote: </p>

    <p> I'm not arguing either for or against statedumps (yet
      anyways), but here are a few observations: </p>

    <p> 1) As you may already know, if an object is replaced from a
      statedump, and the new object contains a field the old one didn't,
      that field will be initialized to nil or zero (depending on the
      type). Well, if we make nil the value to look up the field in the
      archtype, then upgrading an object with an archtype would require
      no work unless the object had to do something with the new type,
      making special upgrade code the exception, rather than the
      rule. (PS inplace upgrading while online follows the same
      semantics). </p>

    <p> 2) You may have to worry if an integer is initialized to zero
      -- this may not be what you want (you may want it to look up the
      archtype value, for instance). On the other hand, if you also have
      a flag saying whether this value is present, that will also be
      initialized to 0 or false, which will once again indicate to look
      up the value in the archtype. </p>

    <p> 3) I would much rather spend the extra effort now to look up
      memory leaks as they occur, because they'll be a lot harder to
      find when phantasmal is tens of thousands of lines, instead of
      just thousands of lines. </p>

    <p> 4) At the moment phantasmal is set up to use UNQ, converting
      it to use statedumps would be extra effort. </p>

    <hr />

    <p style="color: green">Noah wrote: </p>

    <p> 1) This is true -- and is (usually) fine when adding a new
      field, especially since I usually use the upgrade() function to
      initialize values rather than create() anyway, as you may have
      noticed. </p>

    <p> 2) Or if you have an array, which must be initialized to ({ })
      rather than nil, etc. There *are* values that *must* be
      initialized, or else all your code needs to check for the value
      that means &quot;just upgraded&quot; (blech). The flag is the same
      problem -- every time you use the value you must first check the
      flag, which is *definitely* upgrade-specific code. Remember that
      any MUD instance started after you first add that flag &amp; field
      will never have the flag set to false, so all of that coding and
      testing is wasted after the initial upgrade. I much prefer putting
      a bunch of upgrade-specific code into a single upgrade() function
      than peppering it all through the other code, since it's hard to
      make sure you removed all of it afterward. </p>

    <p> Or you could never remove it, but then your code will be full
      of many, many little flags and things specifically for people
      currently upgrading from an old version. Phantasmal *has* a way to
      upgrade from an old version, and UNQ also has a number of other
      uses. It's much, much less gross than having all Phantasmal code
      everywhere have to check a flag before accessing each field and
      then decide to use that field or some default value. </p>

    <p> You could just use an upgraded() func that recognizes every
      previous data layout as well, but if you ever remove fields from
      the object (and you will), that gets very hairy. But then, you
      could use a lot of catch() statements to see whether that variable
      exists. Your upgraded() function is *still* going to be really
      ugly, but at least it's just that one function. By the way, you
      know this will never work if you never test it, so you're going to
      have to keep a copy of every old version of the MUD that you care
      about running (or at least statedumped) so that you can restore
      from it. You knew that, right? That's what I mean by linear
      testing effort every version, so quadratic testing effort over
      time -- for 0.010 you test 0.009, 0.008, 0.007, 0.006, 0.005, etc,
      and then for version 0.011 you test all the same things, plus
      0.010. And that's assuming that you only support the major
      releases, not the CVS development versions we've been encouraging
      people to use. </p>

    <p> Ew. </p>

    <p> 3) The memory leaks thing is a good point, and that's a decent
      rationale for always using the same statedump. The thing is that
      *finding* the memory leaks isn't so hard. *Fixing* the memory
      leaks is much harder because you've gotta paw through all the old
      stuff and get rid of what shouldn't be there. With UNQ, you fix
      the code so that it no longer leaks, you shutdown and you
      reload. Bye-bye memory leak, and bye-bye leaked memory. With a
      statedump, you've spewed all over your memory space and now you
      have to clean it up without disturbing the parts you want to
      keep. Not easy. </p>

    <p> 4) Actually, supporting statedumps is trivial. Phantasmal
      should already work just fine with them. Check the help commands
      for things like %reboot. It's just that UNQ and %shutdown are what
      I personally happen to use, so that's what gets tested. </p>

    <hr />

    <p style="color: green"> And slightly later, Noah submat an
      example:</p>

    <p> Speaking of memory leaks... </p>

    <p> There's a bug in one of Keith's patches that illustrates a
      problem and how Phantasmal gets around it. Don't think I'm picking
      on you, Keith, it's just that you've submitted actual code :-) By
      and large it's good stuff, but (not shockingly) there are some
      bits of Phantasmal and the Kernel MUDLib you're not 100% familiar
      with. </p>

    <p> So... DGD is garbage-collected, so you should be able to clone
      something, get it out of your globals and let it go away silently
      afterward. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the Kernel MUDLib
      tracks all objects and all clones, so a cloned object that isn't
      explicitly destructed won't ever be garbage-collected. That's less
      good. </p>

    <p> Very specifically, in MAPD::init(), you now instantiate a DTD
      for the room binder. There are a couple of things you should do
      differently in order to make this all work as &quot;normal&quot;
      phantasmal code. The first and simplest is that you should either
      keep track of the DTD, or you should destruct it at the end of
      init. </p>

    <p> Why keep track of it? Because you'll want to be able to add
      entries to the roomfile. The way Phantasmal does this with a lot
      of things, like the HELPD, is to reread the configuration files as
      part of upgraded(), so they'll be read again when that file is
      compiled explicitly, and also on %full_rebuild. </p>

    <p> This is an example of the whole statedump/UNQ thing, by the
      way -- I can just fix the code on my system, then %shutdown and
      restore. A statedump zealot, if they were going to fix this, would
      need to add some way to find all the various clones of UNQ_DTD,
      figure out which one was the leaked room binder UNQ_DTD, and
      destruct it. Not rocket science, but much harder than my solution
      to the same problem. </p>

    <p> On the other hand, my solution causes actual downtime. The
      other one doesn't, at least if it's done right. </p>

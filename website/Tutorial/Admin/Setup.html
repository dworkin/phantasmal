    <h3 align="center"> Downloading and Installing Phantasmal </h3>

    <p> Not everything is actually written here.
      This tutorial is, instead, here to tell you where to
      look for the real deal.  The installation procedure changes
      pretty often and it'd
      be silly to put the instructions in multiple places, especially since
      instructions on the web will go out of date,
      or be too up-to-date for your version or otherwise irritate
      you.  So we package them with the MUDLib.  You should use those. </p>

    <p> Which means you'll need a MUDLib.  Go ahead and
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48659">
	download</a>
      the latest release of Phantasmal and have a look at the
      INSTALL file in the root directory of the installation.
      It'll tell you everything you need to know there. </p>

    <p> Or instead, you can be the coolest geek on your block
      by downloading and using the absolute <i>most</i>
      up-to-date version of Phantasmal in
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=48659">SourceForge
	CVS</a>-o-vision. </p>

    <p> CVS users, please note:  when upgrading Phantasmal, please
      shut your
      copy down, grab and install the new code and start it back
      up.  I make changes that will break if you just put in the
      new patches and type &quot;%full_rebuild&quot;.  I make them
      constantly.  And I don't warn about it first.  So either
      inspect all changes manually before installing them
      (with &quot;cvs update -Pd&quot;), inpect them before rebuilding,
      or shut down your MUD before installing them.  Note that
      UNQ files almost never change format in an incompatible way and
      I'm likely to warn well before I do so (if you let me know
      you exist by posting on the
      <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=48659">forums</a>,
      anyway).  So the shutdown-and-restart method will only break
      when I make a genuine mistake :-) </p>

    <h3 align="center"> After You've Installed Phantasmal </h3>

    <p> The first thing to do after you've run the server, then telnetted
      to it from a console or MUDClient, is to make an admin account.
      It's easy.  The MUD asks you &quot;login: &quot;.  You respond
      with the name &quot;admin&quot;, then pick a password.
      Hey presto, you're
      the administrator with full power.  Now log out (with the
      <b>quit</b> command) and log in again with another username.
      Any name, any password.  Log this one out too, then log in
      as admin again (dizzy yet?).
      Use the same password you gave admin last time.  Now you'll give
      your new account some privileges -- if you called him &quot;foo&quot;
      then you'd say &quot;%grant foo access&quot; and
      &quot;grant foo / full&quot;.  Note the spaces before and after
      each word, including the slash. </p>

    <p> With me so far?  From here on out, if you get messages that say
      you can't do these things without being an administrator, or that
      permission is denied, or if Phantasmal just doesn't recognize any
      of the commands starting with % or @ for certain users, it
      pretty much means you did something wrong last paragraph.  The
      exception is stuff you <i>really</i> shouldn't do like trying
      to delete files from the /kernel directory.  Operations like that
      will tell you you can't, and you can't.  Don't. </p>

    <p> Now let's <a href="../index.html">build some rooms and objects</a>.
      Trust me, you'll love it. </p>

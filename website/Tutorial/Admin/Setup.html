    <h3 align="center"> Downloading and Installing Phantasmal </h3>

    <p> For a non-bundled release, you're going to need to read the
      documentation and follow it.  You're also going to need to
      install DGD and get it working, which involves reading even more
      documentation.  I know, that's unfair and unreasonable in this
      day and age.  Do it anyway.  Or, you can pick up the bundled
      release of Phantasmal.  It's much more grab-and-go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if you use the bundled version you'll still need to unpack
      it successfully and run the install script (NOTE: install script
      may not be finished, you may need to change one line in the .dgd
      file by hand).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find either one at the <a
      href="http://www.sf.net/projects/phantasmal">Phantasmal
      SourceForge project</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 align="center"> After You've Installed Phantasmal </h3>

    <p> The first thing to do after you've run the server, then telnetted
      to it from a console or MUDClient, is to make an admin account.
      It's easy.  The MUD asks you &quot;login: &quot;.  You respond
      with the name &quot;admin&quot;, then pick a password.
      Hey presto, you're
      the administrator with full power.  Now log out (with the
      <b>quit</b> command) and log in again with another username.
      Any name, any password.  Log this one out too, then log in
      as admin again (dizzy yet?).
      Use the same password you gave admin last time.  Now you'll give
      your new account some privileges -- if you called him &quot;foo&quot;
      then you'd say &quot;%grant foo access&quot; and
      &quot;grant foo / full&quot;.  Note the spaces before and after
      each word, including the slash. </p>

    <p> With me so far?  From here on out, if you get messages that say
      you can't do these things without being an administrator, or that
      permission is denied, or if Phantasmal just doesn't recognize any
      of the commands starting with % or @ for certain users, it
      pretty much means you did something wrong last paragraph.  The
      exception is stuff you <i>really</i> shouldn't do like trying
      to delete files from the /kernel directory.  Operations like that
      will tell you you can't, and you can't.  Don't. </p>

    <p> Now let's <a href="../index.html">build some rooms and objects</a>.
      Trust me, you'll love it. </p>

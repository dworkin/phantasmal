@@TITLE Starting and Stopping@@

<h2>Starting and Stopping Your MUD</h2>

<p>Starting your MUD is something you should already have done. You
saw how to make the "phantasmal.dgd" configuration file, and you've
probably read enough DGD documentation to know how to start with
that from a statedump file (<i>haven't</i> you?). So let's see
about stopping the MUD cleanly, and about making those statedump
files.</p>

<p>Phantasmal stores its data in two primary ways between restarts.
Those ways are statedump files and UNQ files. Let's start with
statedumps because they're easier.</p>

<p>You can use the <b>%swapout</b> command to swap out all objects.
This makes sure your statedump file is up-to-date, though you're
still better off typing "%statedump" instead. In fact, by and
large, we don't recommend the <b>%swapout</b> command for anything
but debugging.</p>

<p>If you want to swap out to the swapfile and make sure you get
the very latest of everything, you probably want to use
<b>%reboot</b>, which will swap everything to the swapfile and then
shut your MUD down. This is the best way to be sure of preserving
everything since the swapfile is all-inclusive. All hail DGD!</p>

<p>In addition to the swapfile you have the UNQ data files. The
ones for most in-game objects live under the "/data/object/"
directory. You'll want to use them to hand-edit files, to do
certain kinds of upgrades, to view files directly in your text
editor, and perhaps for more reasons as well. These are much more
like traditional MUD area and object files.</p>

<p>You can write them out with <b>%datadump</b>, also simply called
<b>%save</b>. You can write to a backup set of filenames with
<b>%safesave</b> -- your MUD won't automatically overwrite these
files on shutdown, and they won't be removed or destroyed normally.
Basically, it's one more way to make a backup.</p>

<p>You can write to those files and shut the MUD down by typing
"%shutdown". That updates your UNQ files but not your statedump.
It's the most conservative way to shut the MUD down, and the least
amenable to long uptimes. It also gives you the best chance of
recovery if anything goes wrong, and will fix things like leaked
memory or resources -- which can be a serious problem on a
persistent MUD.</p>

<p>What now? You could read more <a href=
"../index.html">tutorials</a>. It's not like there's any shortage.
Or you could read the extended remix of how statedumps are
different from UNQfiles, which is mostly reproduced below. This is
originally taken from the SourceForge Developer Forum in November
of 2002, and is a discussion mainly between me (Angelbob, or Noah
Gibbs), Keith Dunwoody and sarak (Neil McBride).</p>

<p style="color: green">Neil wrote (among other things):</p>

<p>It started me asking the question that if it's a persistant mud
using the DGD driver, why do we need to convert the data in the
objects into UNQ to save onto disk? The UNQ format is good for
archtypes so we can make copies or inherit from one (if that's
possible in that format) but it seems we're doing something we
don't need to if we're writing the data from objects down in UNQ
format.</p>

<p>DGD saves the state and everybody's happy :) Perhaps a UNQ save
could be done for a version change of DGD where the old dump file
becomes unusable?</p>

<p>Along the same lines I thought that development could happen in
much the same way, yet I still need to think more on that to get
the idea clear in my head.</p>

<p>Sorry for the vagueness, but this is just popping into my head
now so I thought I'd write it down somewhere before I forgot it all
again :p</p>

<p>Anyway, there's my idea. We use UNQ for archtypes and DGD's dump
feature for the ongoing world. Other than the 'difficult for people
unfamiliar with it', what other problems would this have?</p>

<p style="color: green">Noah replied:</p>

<p>In theory, no problem at all. This is roughly what Skotos does
with their stuff (using XML, not UNQ, and pretty much only for
ur-object import/export). It can definitely be done.</p>

<p>What it costs Phantasmal specifically is the way I currently do
upgrades and stuff. In a system that dynamic, you have to be ready
to write on-the-fly translators between all the in-memory data
formats as they change. For instance, at one point I changed the
helpfile structures to use a different set of fields. In the
current system I just made the new fields optional in the UNQ
loader (it filled in default values), shutdown and started back up.
Hey, presto, everything was done with the bright shiny new
fields.</p>

<p>You could do that in a running system -- for instance, the HELPD
will currently reload all entries every time the upgrade() command
is called. Unfortunately you have to do it a little more carefully
because upgrade() runs with the old code, not the new code. This
will be fixed eventually, probably by adding *another* upgrade-type
function that is compiled and then run later as part of another
thread. You have to do it as another thread because the actual
recompile takes place after the current thread has entirely
completed. It's all a little touch-and-go.</p>

<p>Now you could, for every system, just have an easy way to reload
from UNQ just for that system like the HELPD above if you do it
carefully or if upgraded() worked right. But then you quickly get
to the same point, or you do far more work, or both.</p>

<p>For instance, say you add new fields to objects. You need to
write code to go through all existing objects and give them good
default values. Or, you could reload all your archetypes from UNQ.
This would leave all your instances in place, but require more code
to make sure you updated all your instances and all your archetypes
and never got any errors while it was halfway done.</p>

<p>There's another question: how do you deal with loss of data?
What if some admin writes a bad command and you lose location data
for a random 1% of all objects in the game, and you need to restore
from old backup files? UNQ is a pretty simple format to play with
(in Perl, for instance). DGD dumpfiles are not. You can extract
specific little chunks of an UNQ file easily, or just only use the
ones you care about (just roomfile.unq, and only certain rooms).
That's much harder when you've got a full memory dump from a
running program.</p>

<p>Skotos handles this with very regular backups of old dumpfiles,
and if something goes catastrophically wrong they can pick through
the in-memory stuff with their debugging tools, or through the
dumpfile similarly, and it's *very* labor-intensive. I happen to
like the idea of having easily-modifiable and easily-parsable
backups.</p>

<p>The other thing is: since your modifiable objects, your
instances, have to have basically everything that your archetypes
do, and you need to be able to read and write your archetypes as
UNQ, you've already done 99% of the work to save your instances. If
you want to have a way to load or save just the archetypes, go
through, do an object save and only save objects with the archetype
flag set. Not a big deal. If you look at the %save_objects command,
it's already able to do a "picky save", it's just that you supply
the object numbers instead of it going through and picking out
archetypes for itself. An "%archetype_save" command or
"%save_objects archetypes" or something would be pretty easy to
do.</p>

<p>So why does Skotos do it that way? Because some of their
development servers have been running off the same statefiles,
without a reboot, since something like 1997, or had when they made
that old post to the DGD mailing list :-) They're a real commercial
outfit and they *really* care about uptime. I'm a callous bastard
who reboots when he feels like it, and as long as it's possible for
people with the drive of Skotos to do what they do based on
Phantasmal, I feel no compulsion to do the same thing for myself.
I'm quite happy announcing that people should stop doing stuff they
care about, dumping all the data to UNQ, then rebooting and
reloading from UNQ. It means I can dump all the old memory leaks
and inconsistencies easily, and it means I can upgrade Phantasmal
without having to convert all the old in-memory data. As far as I'm
concerned, yay for reboots :-P</p>

<p>I'm exaggerating, but you see my point. Doing it "right", the
way you suggest, winds up being far more labor-intensive in the
long run. There's nothing deeply wrong with that, but it means that
you're trading ease of development for uptime. That's great in a
mature, running system but it sucks for something that isn't really
even beta-test level yet, like Phantasmal.</p>

<p>And think about it, do we really want to accompany every
significant CVS checkin with a full set of code to do any necessary
upgrades on a running server? Do you know what a bitch that can be
to test properly? And you'll also need to include instructions on
how to use it since some things would be basically: do a
%full_rebuild. Load this specific new CVS file. Rebuild again. Load
the latest CVS. Rebuild again.</p>

<p>Seriously. Try it some time. Incremental updates are harder than
they appear, and only part of the problem is really fixable. Also,
you can't upgrade to the current version from any past version
unless you know which one, so taking a running MUD from a really
old Phantasmal version to the current one would probably require
them to do 30 or more updates, each one where they upgrade their
running MUD off old CVS checkins in specific ways... Or else every
upgrade code, forever, will have to be able to figure out what
older version it's upgrading from and do it right. And that is
called quadratic increase in testing effort -- every version you
release makes every new version harder to test by a constant
amount. Your total testing time is O(V^2) in the number of
versions. Not good.</p>

<p>I'm not arguing either for or against statedumps (yet anyways),
but here are a few observations:</p>

<p>1) As you may already know, if an object is replaced from a
statedump, and the new object contains a field the old one didn't,
that field will be initialized to nil or zero (depending on the
type). Well, if we make nil the value to look up the field in the
archtype, then upgrading an object with an archtype would require
no work unless the object had to do something with the new type,
making special upgrade code the exception, rather than the rule.
(PS inplace upgrading while online follows the same semantics).</p>

<p>2) You may have to worry if an integer is initialized to zero --
this may not be what you want (you may want it to look up the
archtype value, for instance). On the other hand, if you also have
a flag saying whether this value is present, that will also be
initialized to 0 or false, which will once again indicate to look
up the value in the archtype.</p>

<p>3) I would much rather spend the extra effort now to look up
memory leaks as they occur, because they'll be a lot harder to find
when phantasmal is tens of thousands of lines, instead of just
thousands of lines.</p>

<p>4) At the moment phantasmal is set up to use UNQ, converting it
to use statedumps would be extra effort.</p>
<hr>

<p style="color: green">Noah wrote:</p>

<p>1) This is true -- and is (usually) fine when adding a new
field, especially since I usually use the upgrade() function to
initialize values rather than create() anyway, as you may have
noticed.</p>

<p>2) Or if you have an array, which must be initialized to ({ })
rather than nil, etc. There *are* values that *must* be
initialized, or else all your code needs to check for the value
that means "just upgraded" (blech). The flag is the same problem --
every time you use the value you must first check the flag, which
is *definitely* upgrade-specific code. Remember that any MUD
instance started after you first add that flag &amp; field will
never have the flag set to false, so all of that coding and testing
is wasted after the initial upgrade. I much prefer putting a bunch
of upgrade-specific code into a single upgrade() function than
peppering it all through the other code, since it's hard to make
sure you removed all of it afterward.</p>

<p>Or you could never remove it, but then your code will be full of
many, many little flags and things specifically for people
currently upgrading from an old version. Phantasmal *has* a way to
upgrade from an old version, and UNQ also has a number of other
uses. It's much, much less gross than having all Phantasmal code
everywhere have to check a flag before accessing each field and
then decide to use that field or some default value.</p>

<p>You could just use an upgraded() func that recognizes every
previous data layout as well, but if you ever remove fields from
the object (and you will), that gets very hairy. But then, you
could use a lot of catch() statements to see whether that variable
exists. Your upgraded() function is *still* going to be really
ugly, but at least it's just that one function. By the way, you
know this will never work if you never test it, so you're going to
have to keep a copy of every old version of the MUD that you care
about running (or at least statedumped) so that you can restore
from it. You knew that, right? That's what I mean by linear testing
effort every version, so quadratic testing effort over time -- for
0.010 you test 0.009, 0.008, 0.007, 0.006, 0.005, etc, and then for
version 0.011 you test all the same things, plus 0.010. And that's
assuming that you only support the major releases, not the CVS
development versions we've been encouraging people to use.</p>

<p>Ew.</p>

<p>3) The memory leaks thing is a good point, and that's a decent
rationale for always using the same statedump. The thing is that
*finding* the memory leaks isn't so hard. *Fixing* the memory leaks
is much harder because you've gotta paw through all the old stuff
and get rid of what shouldn't be there. With UNQ, you fix the code
so that it no longer leaks, you shutdown and you reload. Bye-bye
memory leak, and bye-bye leaked memory. With a statedump, you've
spewed all over your memory space and now you have to clean it up
without disturbing the parts you want to keep. Not easy.</p>

<p>4) Actually, supporting statedumps is trivial. Phantasmal should
already work just fine with them. Check the help commands for
things like %reboot. It's just that UNQ and %shutdown are what I
personally happen to use, so that's what gets tested.</p>
<hr>

<p style="color: green">And slightly later, Noah submat an
example:</p>

<p>Speaking of memory leaks...</p>

<p>There's a bug in one of Keith's patches that illustrates a
problem and how Phantasmal gets around it. Don't think I'm picking
on you, Keith, it's just that you've submitted actual code :-) By
and large it's good stuff, but (not shockingly) there are some bits
of Phantasmal and the Kernel MUDLib you're not 100% familiar
with.</p>

<p>So... DGD is garbage-collected, so you should be able to clone
something, get it out of your globals and let it go away silently
afterward. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the Kernel MUDLib tracks
all objects and all clones, so a cloned object that isn't
explicitly destructed won't ever be garbage-collected. That's less
good.</p>

<p>Very specifically, in MAPD::init(), you now instantiate a DTD
for the room binder. There are a couple of things you should do
differently in order to make this all work as "normal" phantasmal
code. The first and simplest is that you should either keep track
of the DTD, or you should destruct it at the end of init.</p>

<p>Why keep track of it? Because you'll want to be able to add
entries to the roomfile. The way Phantasmal does this with a lot of
things, like the HELPD, is to reread the configuration files as
part of upgraded(), so they'll be read again when that file is
compiled explicitly, and also on %full_rebuild.</p>

<p>This is an example of the whole statedump/UNQ thing, by the way
-- I can just fix the code on my system, then %shutdown and
restore. A statedump zealot, if they were going to fix this, would
need to add some way to find all the various clones of UNQ_DTD,
figure out which one was the leaked room binder UNQ_DTD, and
destruct it. Not rocket science, but much harder than my solution
to the same problem.</p>

<p>On the other hand, my solution causes actual downtime. The other
one doesn't, at least if it's done right.</p>

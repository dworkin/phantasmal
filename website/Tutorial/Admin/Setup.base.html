<h2>Setting Up a Phantasmal-based MUD</h2>

<p>You might wonder how this is different from the other <a href=
"../../Setup/index.html">Setup Documents</a>. The difference is
that <i>those</i> will tell you how to create your own game on top
of Phantasmal. <i>This</i> one will tell you how to start using
unmodified Phantasmal so you can play with it.</p>

<h3>Downloading and Installing Phantasmal</h3>

<p>For a non-bundled release, you're going to need to read the
documentation and follow it. You're also going to need to install
DGD and get it working, which involves reading even more
documentation. I know, that's unfair and unreasonable in this day
and age. Do it anyway. Or, you can pick up the bundled release of
Phantasmal. It's much more grab-and-go.</p>

<p>Even if you use the bundled version you'll still need to unpack
it successfully and run the install script (NOTE: install script
may not be finished, you may need to change one line in the .dgd
file by hand).</p>

<p>You can find either one at the <a href=
"http://www.sf.net/projects/phantasmal">Phantasmal SourceForge
project</a>.</p>

<h3>After You've Installed Phantasmal</h3>

<p>The first thing to do after you've run the server, then
telnetted to it from a console or MUDClient, is to make an admin
account. It's easy. The MUD asks you "login: ". You respond with
the name "admin", then pick a password. Hey presto, you're the
administrator with full power. Now log out (with the <b>quit</b>
command) and log in again with another username. Any name, any
password. Log this one out too, then log in as admin again (dizzy
yet?). Use the same password you gave admin last time. Now you'll
give your new account some privileges -- if you called him "foo"
then you'd say "%grant foo access" and "grant foo / full". Note the
spaces before and after each word, including the slash.</p>

<p>With me so far? From here on out, if you get messages that say
you can't do these things without being an administrator, or that
permission is denied, or if Phantasmal just doesn't recognize any
of the commands starting with % or @ for certain users, it pretty
much means you did something wrong last paragraph. The exception is
stuff you <i>really</i> shouldn't do like trying to delete files
from the /kernel directory. Operations like that will tell you you
can't, and you can't. Don't.</p>

<p>Now let's <a href="../index.html">build some rooms and
objects</a>. Trust me, you'll love it.</p>

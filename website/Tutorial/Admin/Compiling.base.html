<h2>Compiling Programs In Your MUD</h2>

<p>If you're a free spirit that likes to live dangerously then
you'll want to change your source files and play with them
dynamically while the MUD is running. If you're writing features
for somebody else's MUD and you don't run your own MUD on the same
codebase, changing things on the fly is pretty much mandatory.
Either way, this tutorial will start you on that road.</p>

<p>Being able to compile or recompile a single program is the most
basic step, and you'll need the <b>%compile</b> command to do it.
You can type "%compile /usr/System/initd" to recompile the InitD,
for instance. If it succeeds it'll tell you so, and if it fails
it'll print the error(s) it got when trying to compile.</p>

<p>Recompiling a library is more interesting, and at this point I'd
recommend using the <b>%full_rebuild</b> command any time you
modify any library -- better safe than sorry, and it's hard to keep
track of what needs to be recompiled and what already has been. The
<b>%full_rebuild</b> command will take care of these things for
you. If you're curious what all the fuss is, have a look at the
<a href="../../DGD/Kernel/index.html">Kernel Library</a> and read
the document on Inheritance. Rather than understanding all that,
though, you can let <b>%full_rebuild</b> do the automated version
for you.</p>

<p>Simply type "%full_rebuild" by itself at the command line and
you'll see a message that it's rebuilding, eventually followed by
the word "Done". That's if there's no errors. If an error occurs
then you'll see the errors printed. In that case, not all of the
rebuild will happen since it stops at the file causing the
error.</p>

<h2>Upgrading Objects In-Place</h2>

<p>When you rebuild a program that has instances or clones, or even
one that you call functions on, you'll be changing its behavior.
For instance, recompiling /usr/common/sys/mapd to have new code or
data will instantly take effect after the rebuild, and rebuilding
/usr/System/obj/user will immediately change the behavior of any
network connections to users.</p>

<p>When you add a data field, it starts uninitialized. When you
remove one or change its type, it also goes away or becomes
uninitialized. In that case, you may want to run a snippet of code
to give it a new and more sensible value. The obvious way to do
that is to put a function called "upgraded" in its definition. The
"upgraded" function should take a single integer varargs argument
of type <b>int</b> if the class is cloneable and you expect to call
the function on clones.</p>

<p>ObjectD will only call the upgraded function once for each
program it upgrades. That means that daemons like MapD and ExitD
will be able to simply use "upgraded" to update their data.
Libraries have no instance data so they're not too likely to have
problems (though they may cause problems for programs that inherit
them!), but clonable objects may have more to worry about. Since
each clone has instance data, it may be necessary to notify each
clone of the upgrade. Given how long it can take to call "upgraded"
on each and every clone, the ObjectD doesn't do this. So your
program may need to perform an operation on every current clone
when you upgrade its code and data members.</p>

<p>One way to avoid this problem is to have an initialization flag
in the object, one you've just added. Then you can initialize the
new data when you perform some common operation on the object and
set the flag as well. This wastes a little space for the flag, and
a little time when checking for it (remember, the code that checks
for the flag is there forever, it's just that you only initialize
once). But it can be preferable to having to notify all the clones
of your object.</p>

<p>As a final note: if your object has an "upgrading" function,
that function will be called before the object is recompiled. It
uses the original code, <b>not</b> the new code after the
recompile. The "upgraded" function uses the new, post-recompile
code. It's important to keep track of this in some way. In
Phantasmal, currently we just always use "upgraded" so that we know
the code we're using is the latest revision and we don't have to
worry about whether the code in "upgrading" did the right thing.
One can certainly imagine cases where the upgrade system might use
"upgrading", though -- for instance, classes that can read and
write themselves to UNQ might save an UNQ version of themselves
with "upgrading" and reload from it with "upgraded", which would
nicely avoid problems when changing data types.</p>

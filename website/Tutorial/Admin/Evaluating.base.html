<h2>Evaluating Arbitrary Code</h2>

<p>When you were <a href="Compiling.html">compiling</a> code
earlier, you may have thought it was a little odd to see a result
like "$0 = &lt;/usr/System/initd&gt;". This tutorial will tell you
what that means.</p>

<p>The <b>%history</b> command will show you values like $0 above
if you type it by itself from the command line. You should see all
the results that you got from the <b>%compile</b>, <b>%clone</b>
and <b>%code</b> commands.</p>

<p>Clone? Code? Those are new ones. Let's hit <b>%clone</b> first.
You'll need to pick a clonable object, one that could be useful to
clone, or at least not going to cause an error. So daemons like
InitD are right out. Instead, try typing "%clone
/usr/common/obj/simple_portable". It should return something like
"$2 = &lt;/usr/common/obj/simple_portable&gt;". But you don't want
something like that hanging around without supervision, so go ahead
and get rid of it. Type "%destruct $2" -- but use whatever number
you got back from <b>%clone</b>, don't just destruct history object
number 2.</p>

<p>Note that if instead we had typed "%destruct
/usr/common/obj/simple_portable", it would <i>not</i> have done the
same thing -- there are specific, individual clones of each
cloneable object, and they take some tracking down. You can see how
many a given object has by typing "%od_report &lt;object&gt;",
though there are some subtleties there -- it may not report the
full number if you have multiple issues of an object that aren't
properly upgraded. If this is all greek to you, don't worry about
it. Just take my word for it that specific individual clones are
tough to track down, so make sure to destruct the ones you
create.</p>

<p>Now that you've carefully cleaned up after yourself, go ahead
and type "%clear". It'll clear out your entire history list so far
and you'll lose any references to things that you were keeping
around. That's why you cleaned up first.</p>

<p>And that leaves only the <b>%code</b> command to introduce. Go
ahead and type "%code 4". You'll get a result like "$17 = 4".
Exciting, huh? But you can use the same thing to evaluate arbitrary
LPC code, and that's much more interesting. For instance, you could
type "%code ({ 1, 7, 9 }) [1]", which should return the value 7. Or
you can cause side-effects by calling objects in Phantasmal. A
pretty harmless example is "%code
find_object("/usr/common/sys/mapd")-&gt;get_room_by_num(7)" which
should find the MAPD and return you a reference to object #7, or
nil. Naturally you can also reduce it to "%code
find_object("/usr/common/sys/mapd")" and then use the number it
returns -- for instance, if it came back with "$34 =
&lt;/usr/common/sys/mapd&gt;", you could then say "%code
$34-&gt;get_room_by_num(347)".</p>

<p>So there are your fun toys of the day. Knock yourself out. And

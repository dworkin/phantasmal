    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Admin Access and Path Permissions </h3>

    <p> Remember that incantation you did way back when, the one you
      used to give you administrator character his power as a Mighty
      Admin?  Now we'll get around to letting you know how that worked
      and what similar things you can do. </p>

    <p> Phantasmal has its roots in the Kernel Library, and nowhere
      is that more obvious than in these commands right here.
      There's a full permissions system for this stuff that's
      <i>entirely separate</i> from the way Phantasmal does most of
      what it does, and people who are seriously privileged under
      this system have full power to do absolutely anything to the
      MUD if they're so inclined.  That's a generalization, but
      basically it's very hard to defend your Phantasmal MUD
      against somebody with these privileges -- it's just not
      designed for it.  Once somebody can run arbitrary code, and
      once they can compile objects inside the main body of your
      MUD, a sufficiently clever attacker will be able to do
      weird and nasty stuff to your MUD in one way or another. </p>

    <p> So, let's show you how to give people this power, and
      what you can do to understand it. </p>

    <p> First, you should learn how to find out who can do what, and
      who exists in your MUD.  The <b>%access</b> command is a fine way
      to determine what permissions somebody has.  Just type
      &quot;%access AdminName&quot; and it'll tell you what file access
      you've given them.  That file access takes the form of paths and
      types.  For instance, awhile back when you typed &quot;%grant
      SomeIdiot / full&quot;, what you did was to give them full (that's
      read/write plus admin) access to the root directory -- in other
      words, full power to do anything to any file.  And yes, that would
      be why it's hard to stop them from hurting your MUD if they so
      choose. </p>

    <p> There are also global areas that anybody can read.  That's
      important for things like the ROOM object that other people need
      to be able to inherit.  So if you type &quot;%access global&quot;
      in Phantasmal, you'll find that the &quot;/usr/common&quot;
      directory is globally readable.  That's where we store stuff like
      ROOM and OBJECT so it has to be globally readable. </p>

    <p> The Kernel Library (and thus Phantasmal) stores a list of
      everybody that has any access that it cares about.  Before
      you can have any specific access, you have to be on The List.
      The way to put somebody on The List is to type &quot;%grant
      WhoEverTheyAre access&quot;.  To take them off the list,
      just type &quot;%ungrant WhoEverTheyAre access&quot;. </p>

    <p> So <b>%access</b> tells you what they can play with.  How
      do you change it?  <b>%grant</b> and <b>%ungrant</b> again,
      it turns out.  The syntax for <b>%grant</b> is
      &quot;%grant AdminName &lt;path&gt; &lt;access&gt;&quot;.
      Path is just the path, and AdminName is granted the listed
      access to that path and all subdirectories (with some
      specific exceptions that the Kernel Library provides).
      Access is one of: read, write, full.  Full means both
      read and write, but also administrative access to do
      other things.  The <b>%ungrant</b> command has the same
      syntax, but does the opposite -- it removes access to
      that path.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center"> Quotas and Resources </h3>

    <p> There are certain types of resources that the Kernel
      MUDLib tracks and limits.  You can only use so much of
      any one of them before it stops giving you any more.
      The <b>%quota</b> and <b>%rsrc</b> commands let you
      play with them. </p>

    <p> The <b>%rsrc</b> command, typed by itself, will show
      you the total quota and usage of every resource for everybody
      in the MUD.  It may look like this: </p>

    <pre>
resources                usage          max  decay  period
----------------+-------------+------------+------+---------
callouts                     1           -1
create stack                 0            5
create ticks                 0        10000
editors                      0           -1
events                       0           -1
filequota                 1167           -1
objects                    200           -1
stack                        0           50
tick usage             3589379           -1    10% per hour
ticks                        0       250000
    </pre>

    <p> The usage column gives the amount currently in use.  The
      max column tells you the total limit, and the decay
      column lets you know how fast usage of that resource decays.
      On the left, of course, are the resource names.  Let's look
      at one individually.  Go ahead and type &quot;%rsrc tick
      usage&quot;.  You'll see something like this:</p>
    <pre>
owner                    usage          max  decay  period
----------------+-------------+------------+------+---------
Ecru                         0           -1    10% per hour
System                     308           -1    10% per hour
admin                        0           -1    10% per hour
angelbob                101333           -1    10% per hour
common                 3436295           -1    10% per hour
thedarque                    0           -1    10% per hour
    </pre>

    <p> Nifty, no?  That breaks the total down into who is using
      what, and their individual limits.  And <b>%rsrc</b> can
      also be used to set the total limit, by typing
      &quot;%rsrc &lt;rsrc name&gt; &lt;new limit&gt;&quot;.
      That's pretty cool.  Now let's hit our final command
      and see what <b>%quota</b> can do. </p>

    <p> While <b>%rsrc</b> showed us a lot about the overall usage
      of resources for everybody, <b>%quota</b> is more selective.
      Type it by itself to see your usage of each resource, kinda
      like &quot;%rsrc YourName&quot; would do.  Type it with
      an admin's name to see that admin's usage of various resources --
      &quot;%quota SomeIdiot&quot;.  To see one specific resource
      for one specific admin, type &quot;%quota AdminName &lt;resource
      name&gt;&quot;, such as &quot;%quota angelbob tick usage&quot;
      or &quot;%quota angelbob events&quot;.  And finally, you can
      set a new quota for an admin by typing
      &quot;%quota AdminName &lt;resource name&gt; &lt;new limit&gt;&quot;.
      Note that -1 means &quot;unlimited&quot; for most resources,
      which can be a useful thing. </p>

    <p> You got this far and you're still actually reading?  Man,
      you're really delving.  We don't have much more we can show you.

      you haven't already finished.  Below is a listing of various
      resources and what they mean to the Kernel MUDLib.  If you
      micromanage this stuff, you're ahead of me. </p>

    <hr />

    <ul>
      <li> callouts - this is the number of call_out functions that
	are or may be active at once. </li>
      <li> create stack - this is the amount of stack space the Kernel
	Library wants available before it will create a new object </li>
      <li> create ticks - this is the number of ticks the Kernel Library
	wants available before it will create a new object </li>
      <li> editors - this is the number of editor instances that may
	be open and active at once. </li>
      <li> events - the Kernel Library can notify subscriber lists of
	events, which Phantasmal doesn't currently bother with.  This
	is the number of available/possible events. </li>
      <li> filequota - You only get a certain number of bytes of storage
	to play with in your directory (unless this is set to -1).  This
	is how much you're currently using, or your maximum limit. </li>
      <li> objects - each person has a maximum number of allowed objects
	(unless this is set to -1). </li>
      <li> stack - this is the amount of stack space remaining to be
	used </li>
      <li> tick usage - this is the number of ticks that have already
	been used.  Every hour it decreases by 10% in the default
	configuration. </li>
      <li> ticks - this is the number of ticks remaining to be used </li>

    <h3 align="center"> Making New Help Entries </h3>

    <p> Help entries are made using UNQ files.  Each UNQ file contains
      a number of individual entries.  There are a couple of
      interesting subtleties to creating entries.  Let's look at one,
      shall we? </p>

    <pre>
~name{~enUS{%write_log,%log, %log_write,%writelog}}
~keywords{admin}
~desc{
  ~enUS{

The @log (called %log and @write_log also, among others) command takes
a single string argument, much like "say".  However, it will log that
string along with your name to the system log.  In general, this is a
very poor way to send the equivalent of e-mail except on the most
excellently-run MUDs since most of the time the log gets briefly read
through (or not) and tossed out to make room for the next one.

See also:  %log_subscribe, logfile, log channel

}}
    </pre>

    <p> The &quot;name&quot; field tells the Help system what queries
      to return this entry for.  We'll get to that soon.  The
      &quot;keywords&quot; field gives a list of keywords -- the
      query supplies a corresponding list, and only a query with
      the keywords in the help entry will return this entry.  For
      instance, this entry has the &quot;admin&quot; keyword, so
      only queries by admin characters will be returned. </p>

    <p> The &quot;desc&quot; field is a standard UNQ Phrase
      structure.  The one shown here is English-only.  The description
      is what you get when you ask for help on an appropriate thing
      from the &quot;name&quot; field. </p>

    <p> The &quot;name&quot; field here seems incomplete.  If you
      asked for help on &quot;log&quot; or &quot;write log&quot;,
      you'd hope it would give you help as well.  As it turns out,
      it does. </p>

    <p> The Help system ignores most non-alphanumeric characters,
      and it treats <b>-</b> and <b>_</b> as being the same as spaces.
      That means
      that <b>%write_log</b> is the same as <b>write_log</b> is the same as
      <b>write log</b> is the same as <b>@#$write@#$-log@#$#</b>.
      They're all different from <b>writelog</b>, which is the same
      as <b>%writelog</b>, <b>write@log</b>, and <b>@#$@#write#@#%log@#@#</b>.
    </p>

    <p> Soon, words will work in any order.  That means that
      <b>write log data</b> would be the same as <b>data write log</b>
      would be the same as <b>write_data-log</b> and
      <b>@#$#@log@#%#%-@#$#@$write_-data@#$@</b>.  So you see, the
      quite brief set of names above actually matches a surprising
      number of help queries, useful and otherwise. </p>

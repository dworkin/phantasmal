  <h3 style="text-align: center"> UNQ Files:  What Are They? </h3>

  <p>
    UNQ is a format for structured data storage.  It's a lot like XML,
    though it's got some advantages for our use that XML doesn't.
    Specifically, there are some features that XML has that makes it
    difficult to use and to parse.  <a
    href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> solves this problem by
    just not implementing most of the problem features in their XML
    parser.  Phantasmal solves it by using something other than XML.
    That something is called <a
    href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a>, which was
    invented by Tom Lokovic as the basis of a language called PLUNQ.
    We don't use PLUNQ in Phantasmal, but we <i>do</i> use UNQ.  Clear
    as mud?
  </p>

  <p>
    So what's different from XML?  First off, UNQ has none of the
    extra little quoted things inside tags.  Non-tagged stuff
    translates fine.  So an XML/HTML fragment like <tt>What's
    &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, doc?</tt> would become <tt>What's ~i{up},
    doc?</tt> in UNQ.  Note that a tagged fragment starts with a
    tilde, then what the tag is (in this case, &quot;i&quot;), and then has the
    content in curly braces.
  </p>

    <p>
      Like HTML and XML, UNQ embeds nicely in itself.  So an HTML
      expression like <tt>&lt;body&gt; Content goes
      &lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</tt> would become
      <tt>~body{ Content goes ~b{here} }</tt> in UNQ.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike in HTML, you can just skip the label.  So, for instance,
      <tt>{{Fred}{25}}{{Ethel}{39}}</tt> is a perfectly good UNQ
      expression.  The equivalent XML would have a lot of empty tags
      (like, tags that had no name, written something like &lt;&gt;)
      and look awful.
    </p>

    <p>
      UNQ pays attention to whitespace, so <tt>~bob{spam}</tt> and
      <tt>~bob { spam }</tt> are quite different from each other.

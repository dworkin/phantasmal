  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Using Phrases in Phantasmal </h3>

  <p>
    Phantasmal uses structures called 'Phrases' to handle output to
    the user.  Phrases are kind of like strings in other MUDs, but
    they do a number of other things for you as well.  However, they
    can require careful handling.

      <h2 class="center"> Getting a Clean Start </h2>

	<p> You're started up Phantasmal.  You've telnetted to it.
	  Perhaps you've found the Void -- you can tell because a wild
	  wind howls through it.  You've more likely seen the student
	  lounge, and perhaps explored a bit. </p>

	<p> So maybe the start setup is good and maybe it's bad.  Either way,
	  you'd
	  kinda enjoy a clean start, thankyouverymuch.  How do you fix
	  it? </p>

	<p> For starters, shut the MUD down again.  Now have a look in
	  /data/object/.  There'll be some stuff there.  Delete the
	  files of starter objects -- files that may be included are a
	  roomfile, a portablefile, a zonefile and a mobilefile, though
	  you won't have all four in any given version of Phantasmal.
	  Delete the &quot;.old&quot; backup files also, and the
	  &quot;safe&quot; files, if present.
	  There go all my starter rooms and objects you don't want.
	  Or you can just edit them and get rid of the bits you don't
	  want.  This stuff is all public domain, nobody's breathing
	  down your neck about it. </p>

      <p> Start 'er back up.  You'll notice that no matter how much
	  you delete, the Void (room #0) is still around.  No matter how
	  bad you screw up, the Void is meant to stick around.  Random
	  stuff you lose may show up there.  That's a good reason to keep
	  players out of it.  When you've got more of your MUD built
	  you'll probably want to mess with /data/system/config.unq to
	  change the start room. </p>

	<p> Some other stuff:  there's a
	  place called the Meat Locker in config.unq and in your roomfile.
	  That's where bodies go when not in use.  That's important because
	  bodies can only store inventory and keep modifications if they
	  still exist, so they need to go someplace when the player isn't
	  logged in.  Depending on whether the
	  player has disconnected or explicitly logged out, the bodies
	  may be in the meat locker or wherever they were left hanging. </p>

	<p> The zonefile specifies which zones are which.  Zones are
	  a convenience for your builders to keep track of who owns what.
	  The zonefile keeps track of stuff about zones, and maps segments
	  into zones.  See &quot;@help @set_seg_zone&quot; and
	  &quot;@help @segmap&quot; for further details. </p>

	<p> Now go build some more stuff by following
	  the <a href="../index.html">tutorial</a>. </p>

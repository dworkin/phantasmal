      <h2 align="center"> Containers </h2>

      <font size="4">

      <p> You've got basic objects.  You long ago realized how
	cool being able to play with objects and put them inside
	each other is.  You want this capability for your very
	own.  This tutorial can help.</p>

      <p> To make a container, first make a portable.  You
	<a href="Portables.html">remember</a> how to do that, I'm 
	sure.  Just mention things in its description that make
	it sound like a container -- call it a bag, or a breadbox,
	or a sleeping pod, or whatever seems like you could put
	stuff in it. </p>

      <p> Okay.  So you've got your portable object.  I'll call
	it object #210, a large breadbox in the example below.
<pre>

> @set_obj_flag #210 cont 1
Done.

> @set_obj_flag #210 open true
Done.

> @stat #210
Location: #4 (an old tunnel)

-----

</pre>
	See?  Easy.  The trick is the @set_obj_flags lines to
	create a container and open it.  There'll be better
	commands for this stuff eventually, probably... </p>

      <p> What do you read now?  More
	<a href="../index.html">tutorials</a> as they're written, or you
	can start <i>finally</i> reading the help files.  They're
	worth it.  Really.  Seriously.  I promise. I wrote them. </p>

    <h2 class="center"> Tags </h2>

    <p>
      Some codebases call these attributes, or properties.  The idea
      of a Phantasmal tag is that it's a named, typed piece of information
      attached to an object or mobile.  Basically you're adding an
      extra variable to every object or mobile that Phantasmal didn't
      add for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of traditional MUDs have 'deeds' systems or 'quest' systems
      that let you mark particular players as having done one thing or
      another.  Phantasmal tags can be used for the same purpose, and
      are meant to be.  You'll have to tag the player's mobile, currently,
      not the user object, but it should still work just fine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since scripts can potentially get and set tag values, tags can
      also be used for extra variables for scripts.  You have to be
      careful, though -- some Phantasmal-based games may not let you
      randomly make new tags, and it's not good to have lots of
      old temporary tags hanging around forever.  There should be
      some good way to make them go away.  A particular Phantasmal-based
      game may allow you to declare tags that disappear when an object
      leaves a particular room or zone.  Or you could write scripts
      on the exits to remove those temporary tags.
    </p>

    <p>
      Particular Phantasmal-based games will set up different script
      interfaces to tags, but the default wiztool has a simple one
      for one-word tag names.  To declare a new tag type, the syntax
      is &quot;@new_tag_type &lt;scope&gt; &lt;tag name&gt;
      &lt;tag type&gt;&quot;, and
      you can optionally add getter and setter function names after
      that.  Normally you won't want to, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 'scope' parameter is what kind of object the new tag can be
      applied to.  The normal values are 'object' and 'mobile'.
      The tag name must be single-word, meaning no spaces.  Scripts
      don't have this restriction, but the default wiztool tag commands
      all require single-word tag names.  The tag type should specify
      a type like &quot;int&quot; or &quot;float&quot;, or a DGD type
      number like 2.  Not all types may be supported for tags, and tags
      may support non-DGD types like &quot;mobile&quot; or
      &quot;phrase&quot;.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see the new tag you created, type &quot;@list_tags object&quot;
      or &quot;@list_tags mobile&quot;.  That shows all existing tag
      types for the given scope.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see the list of current tags on a given object or mobile, use
      the stat command.  You should either see a list of tag names and
      values, or a status line such as &quot;No Tags Set&quot;.
    </p>

    <p>
      To set the value of a tag on a particular DGD object, use the
      &quot;@set_tag&quot; command.  The syntax is &quot;@set_tag
      &lt;obj&gt; &lt;tag name&gt; &lt;value&gt;&quot;.  The object
      can be specified by number, like &quot;#347&quot;, or as an
      object in the wiztool history, such as &quot;$8&quot;.  The
      tag name must be a single word, with no spaces, as for the
      @new_tag_type command above.  And everything remaining on the
      line is assumed to be the new value, which is evaluated as
      arbitrary LPC code, and can use history values.  It gets
      evaluated essentially just like the %code command, including
      storing the new tag value into the wiztool history list.

      Now that you know how to manipulate tags from the command line,
      you should go practice.  And then you should come back and

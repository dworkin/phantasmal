<h2>Getting a Clean Start</h2>

<p>You're started up Phantasmal. You've telnetted to it. Perhaps
you've found the Void -- you can tell because a wild wind howls
through it. You've more likely seen the student lounge, and perhaps
explored a bit.</p>

<p>So maybe the start setup is good and maybe it's bad. Either way,
you'd kinda enjoy a clean start, thankyouverymuch. How do you fix
it?</p>

<p>For starters, shut the MUD down again. Now have a look in
/data/object/. There'll be some stuff there. Delete the files of
starter objects -- files that may be included are a roomfile, a
portablefile, a zonefile and a mobilefile, though you won't have
all four in any given version of Phantasmal. Delete the ".old"
backup files also, and the "safe" files, if present. There go all
my starter rooms and objects you don't want. Or you can just edit
them and get rid of the bits you don't want. This stuff is all
public domain, nobody's breathing down your neck about it.</p>

<p>Start 'er back up. You'll notice that no matter how much you
delete, the Void (room #0) is still around. No matter how bad you
screw up, the Void is meant to stick around. Random stuff you lose
may show up there. That's a good reason to keep players out of it.
When you've got more of your MUD built you'll probably want to mess
with /data/system/config.unq to change the start room.</p>

<p>Some other stuff: there's a place called the Meat Locker in
config.unq and in your roomfile. That's where bodies go when not in
use. That's important because bodies can only store inventory and
keep modifications if they still exist, so they need to go
someplace when the player isn't logged in. Depending on whether the
player has disconnected or explicitly logged out, the bodies may be
in the meat locker or wherever they were left hanging.</p>

<p>The zonefile specifies which zones are which. Zones are a
convenience for your builders to keep track of who owns what. The
zonefile keeps track of stuff about zones, and maps segments into
zones. See "@help @set_seg_zone" and "@help @segmap" for further
details.</p>

<p>Now go build some more stuff by following the <a href=
"../index.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

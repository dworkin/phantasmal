    <h2 class="center"> Object Details </h2>

    <p>
      Ah, object details, the season when a young man's fancy turns to
      love.  No, wait, that's spring, and it's the season when the
      road to his house turns to mud.  Well, close enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      Object details replace the now-obsolete <a href="NoDesc.html">
	NoDesc Scenery Objects</a>.  The idea is that if an object
      can be referred to, but it's not something you can pick up and
      move around, then it's probably a detail of the room it's in.
      For instance a lamp-post, grass, the sparkle of sun on water,
      and the wall of a building are all essentially integral parts
      of the room they're in -- they're not something the player
      can pick up and move around, though they might be things he
      can look at, put things into, or otherwise manipulate.
    </p>

    <p>
      An object detail can't be picked up.  That's a part of what it
      is.  An object detail <i>can</i> be a container, though -- think
      of a hole in the trunk of a tree, for instance.  An object
      detail is part of some other object, and can't be moved to other
      objects (except by builders, who can do whatever they please to
      a detail, including turning it into a non-detail, if they know
      how).  An object detail may be openable or lockable, just like
      any other container.  When you look in your inventory or around
      the room, open object details will be searched through just like
      other open containers, and sometimes even more aggressively
      than other kinds of containers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently details can't be detached (by a player, not a builder)
      or broken off of their location object (also called their
      detail-of object), but scripts will eventually allow this.  So
      they're part of the object they're part of, and they can't be
      removed.  Phantasmal chooses to consider this a good thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      So how do you make one?  The easiest way is to say
      &quot;@make_detail&quot;, pretty much like how you make a room.
      You'll need to tell the detail what object it's a detail
      <i>of</i>, unlike with a room, so you'll need that object's
      number.  And you'll need to answer a lot of the same kinds of
      questions you would for any other object.  Give it a try.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll definitely want your detail to have a noun and probably
      some adjectives -- you want to be able to look at it, for
      starters.  So if you make a &quot;grass&quot; detail, you can
      &quot;look grass&quot;, and if the grass is a detail of your
      current room, you should see its description.  You can also
      &quot;glance grass&quot; to see its glance description.  Pretty
      cool, no?
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, details are mostly used the same way Phantasmal
      used to use NoDesc objects, and the way many MUDs use
      &quot;keyword&quot; objects -- things that can be looked at but
      not picked up.  And since Phantasmal makes them first-class
      objects, some of the usual problems (&quot;get grass&quot; --
      &quot;You don't see that here!&quot;) are less severe.  Details
      also have the excellent property that they can be inherited.
      You'll find out about that in <a href="Inheritance.html">another
	tutorial</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to change a detail's location after creating it,
      you'll need to use the <b>@set_obj_detail</b> function.  To set
      object number #112 (a detail) to be a detail of base object #37,
      you'd say &quot;@set_obj_detail #37 #112&quot;.  To make a
      detail stop being a detail and start just being an object, set
      its base object to #-1 that way -- &quot;@set_obj_detail #-1
      #112&quot;.
    </p>

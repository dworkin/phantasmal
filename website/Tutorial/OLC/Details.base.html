<h2>Object Details</h2>

<p>Ah, object details, the season when a young man's fancy turns to
love. No, wait, that's spring, and it's the season when the road to
his house turns to mud. Well, close enough.</p>

<p>Object details replace the now-obsolete <a href=
"NoDesc.html">NoDesc Scenery Objects</a>. The idea is that if an
object can be referred to, but it's not something you can pick up
and move around, then it's probably a detail of the room it's in.
For instance a lamp-post, grass, the sparkle of sun on water, and
the wall of a building are all essentially integral parts of the
room they're in -- they're not something the player can pick up and
move around, though they might be things he can look at, put things
into, or otherwise manipulate.</p>

<p>An object detail can't be picked up. That's a part of what it
is. An object detail <i>can</i> be a container, though -- think of
a hole in the trunk of a tree, for instance. An object detail is
part of some other object, and can't be moved to other objects
(except by builders, who can do whatever they please to a detail,
including turning it into a non-detail, if they know how). An
object detail may be openable or lockable, just like any other
container. When you look in your inventory or around the room, open
object details will be searched through just like other open
containers, and sometimes even more aggressively than other kinds
of containers.</p>

<p>Currently details can't be detached (by a player, not a builder)
or broken off of their location object (also called their detail-of
object), but scripts will eventually allow this. So they're part of
the object they're part of, and they can't be removed. Phantasmal
chooses to consider this a good thing.</p>

<p>So how do you make one? The easiest way is to say
"@make_detail", pretty much like how you make a room. You'll need
to tell the detail what object it's a detail <i>of</i>, unlike with
a room, so you'll need that object's number. And you'll need to
answer a lot of the same kinds of questions you would for any other
object. Give it a try.</p>

<p>You'll definitely want your detail to have a noun and probably
some adjectives -- you want to be able to look at it, for starters.
So if you make a "grass" detail, you can "look grass", and if the
grass is a detail of your current room, you should see its
description. You can also "glance grass" to see its glance
description. Pretty cool, no?</p>

<p>At the moment, details are mostly used the same way Phantasmal
used to use NoDesc objects, and the way many MUDs use "keyword"
objects -- things that can be looked at but not picked up. And
since Phantasmal makes them first-class objects, some of the usual
problems ("get grass" -- "You don't see that here!") are less
severe. Details also have the excellent property that they can be
inherited. You'll find out about that in <a href=
"Inheritance.html">another tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to change a detail's location after creating it,
you'll need to use the <b>@set_obj_detail</b> function. To set
object number #112 (a detail) to be a detail of base object #37,
you'd say "@set_obj_detail #37 #112". To make a detail stop being a
detail and start just being an object, set its base object to #-1
that way -- "@set_obj_detail #-1 #112".</p>

<h2 class="center">Object Details</h2>

<p>Ah, object details, the season when a young man's fancy turns to
love. No, wait, that's spring, and it's the season when the road to his
house turns to mud. Well, close enough.</p>

<p>Object details replace the now-obsolete <a href="NoDesc.html">NoDesc
Scenery Objects</a>. The idea is that if an object can be referred to,
but it's not something you can pick up and move around, then it's
probably a detail of the room it's in. For instance a lamp-post, grass,
the sparkle of sun on water, and the wall of a building are all
essentially integral parts of the room they're in -- they're not
something the player can pick up and move around, though they might be
things he can look at, put things into, or otherwise manipulate.</p>

<p>An object detail can't be picked up. That's a part of what it is. An
object detail <i>can</i> be a container, though -- think of a hole in
the trunk of a tree, for instance. An object detail is part of some
other object, and can't be moved to other objects (except by builders,
who can do whatever they please to a detail, including turning it into a
non-detail, if they know how). An object detail may be openable or
lockable, just like any other container. When you look in your inventory
or around the room, open object details will be searched through just
like other open containers, and sometimes even more aggressively than
other kinds of containers.</p>

<p>Currently details can't be detached (by a player, not a builder) or
broken off of their location object (also called their detail-of
object), but scripts will eventually allow this. So they're part of the
object they're part of, and they can't be removed. Phantasmal chooses to
consider this a good thing.</p>

<p>So how do you make one? The easiest way is to say "@make_detail",
pretty much like how you make a room. You'll need to tell the detail
what object it's a detail <i>of</i>, unlike with a room, so you'll need
that object's number. And you'll need to answer a lot of the same kinds
of questions you would for any other object. Give it a try.</p>

<p>You'll definitely want your detail to have a noun and probably some
adjectives -- you want to be able to look at it, for starters. So if you
make a "grass" detail, you can "look grass", and if the grass is a
detail of your current room, you should see its description. You can
also "glance grass" to see its glance description. Pretty cool, no?</p>

<p>At the moment, details are mostly used the same way Phantasmal used
to use NoDesc objects, and the way many MUDs use "keyword" objects --
things that can be looked at but not picked up. And since Phantasmal
makes them first-class objects, some of the usual problems ("get grass"
-- "You don't see that here!") are less severe. Details also have the
excellent property that they can be inherited. You'll find out about
that in <a href="Inheritance.html">another tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to change a detail's location after creating it, you'll
need to use the <b>@set_obj_detail</b> function. To set object number
#112 (a detail) to be a detail of base object #37, you'd say
"@set_obj_detail #37 #112". To make a detail stop being a detail and
start just being an object, set its base object to #-1 that way --
"@set_obj_detail #-1 #112".</p>

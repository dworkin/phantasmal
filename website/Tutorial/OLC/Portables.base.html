@@TITLE Basic Portables@@

<h2>Basic Portables</h2>

<p>So now you've got some rooms. You should put some plunderable
objects in them, naturally. Stuff you can pick up and carry around
is a fine thing.</p>

<p>You can make a quick, simple portable object by typing
"@new_room". The whole weird segment thing still applies.</p>

<p>You can do a lot of the same things you do with rooms --
@set_brief, @set_glance, @set_look, @set_examine, @stat, @move, and
even @goto -- but they do slightly different things in some cases.
For instance, the brief description is what the object looks like
when it's in the room, and not usually the room description. You
can add exits to portables, but they're only usable from
<i>inside</i> the portable, so that's usually pretty pointless.</p>

<p>You can list portables with @list_portables. About the only
other cool stuff you can do with portables is to make them
containers -- more on that in another tutorial.</p>

<p>Once there's a portable around, the obvious thing to do is to
pick it up. For instance:</p>
<pre>

&gt; @new_port
Added portable #204.

&gt; @set_brief #204 a root  
Locale is US english
Setting brief desc on object #204

&gt; @set_glance #204 a chunk of root
Locale is US english
Setting glance desc on object #204

&gt; @set_look #204
Locale is US english
Enter text at the prompt.  Enter ~ on a line by itself to end.
 &gt; You see a chunk of root with bits of dirt still clinging to it.  You 
 &gt; don't know enough about roots to identify it very well, though a lot
 &gt; of bark is still attached, as well as some tiny little hairy rootlets.
 &gt; ~
Set look description.

&gt; @add_noun #204 root rootlet chunk
Adding nouns (enUS).
Done.

&gt; @add_adj #204 dirty hairy
Adding adjectives (enUS).
Done.

&gt; get hairy root
You get a chunk of root.

&gt; drop dirty root
You drop a chunk of root.

&gt; examine root
You see a chunk of root with bits of dirt still clinging to it.  You
don't know enough about roots to identify it very well, though a lot
of bark is still attached, as well as some tiny little hairy rootlets.

    
</pre>Did you catch that bit with @add_noun and @add_adj? You can
use those commands to add lists of nouns and adjectives to an
object, and then refer to the object by any number of its
adjectives followed by one of its nouns. For instance:
<pre>

&gt; @add_noun #204 turnip root tuber vegetable
Adding nouns (enUS).
Done.

&gt; @add_adj #204 small shriveled sere wrinkled withered dry old dried
Adding adjectives (enUS).
Done.

&gt; look old dry withered wrinkled root
This turnip has seen much better days!  It's wrinkled, shriveled up and
generally very, very unappetizing.

&gt; get turnip
You get a wrinkled, dry turnip.

&gt; drop dried tuber
You drop a wrinkled, dry turnip.

    
</pre>

<p>Now you can make nifty objects and pick them up, drop them and
so on for yourself. Go ahead, give it a go.</p>

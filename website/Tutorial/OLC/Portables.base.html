@@TITLE Basic Portables@@

<h2 class="center">Basic Portables</h2>

<p>So now you've got some rooms. You should put some plunderable objects
in them, naturally. Stuff you can pick up and carry around is a fine
thing.</p>

<p>You can make a quick, simple portable object by typing "@new_room".
The whole weird segment thing still applies.</p>

<p>You can do a lot of the same things you do with rooms -- @set_brief,
@set_glance, @set_look, @set_examine, @stat, @move, and even @goto --
but they do slightly different things in some cases. For instance, the
brief description is what the object looks like when it's in the room,
and not usually the room description. You can add exits to portables,
but they're only usable from <i>inside</i> the portable, so that's
usually pretty pointless.</p>

<p>You can list portables with @list_portables. About the only other
cool stuff you can do with portables is to make them containers -- more
on that in another tutorial.</p>

<p>Once there's a portable around, the obvious thing to do is to pick it
up. For instance:</p>
<pre>

&gt; @new_port
Added portable #204.

&gt; @set_brief #204 a root  
Locale is US english
Setting brief desc on object #204

&gt; @set_glance #204 a chunk of root
Locale is US english
Setting glance desc on object #204

&gt; @set_look #204
Locale is US english
Enter text at the prompt.  Enter ~ on a line by itself to end.
 &gt; You see a chunk of root with bits of dirt still clinging to it.  You 
 &gt; don't know enough about roots to identify it very well, though a lot
 &gt; of bark is still attached, as well as some tiny little hairy rootlets.
 &gt; ~
Set look description.

&gt; @add_noun #204 root rootlet chunk
Adding nouns (enUS).
Done.

&gt; @add_adj #204 dirty hairy
Adding adjectives (enUS).
Done.

&gt; get hairy root
You get a chunk of root.

&gt; drop dirty root
You drop a chunk of root.

&gt; examine root
You see a chunk of root with bits of dirt still clinging to it.  You
don't know enough about roots to identify it very well, though a lot
of bark is still attached, as well as some tiny little hairy rootlets.

    </pre>Did you catch that bit with @add_noun and @add_adj? You can use
those commands to add lists of nouns and adjectives to an object, and then
refer to the object by any number of its adjectives followed by one of its
nouns. For instance:
<pre>

&gt; @add_noun #204 turnip root tuber vegetable
Adding nouns (enUS).
Done.

&gt; @add_adj #204 small shriveled sere wrinkled withered dry old dried
Adding adjectives (enUS).
Done.

&gt; look old dry withered wrinkled root
This turnip has seen much better days!  It's wrinkled, shriveled up and
generally very, very unappetizing.

&gt; get turnip
You get a wrinkled, dry turnip.

&gt; drop dried tuber
You drop a wrinkled, dry turnip.

    </pre>

<p>Now you can make nifty objects and pick them up, drop them and so on
for yourself. Go ahead, give it a go.</p>

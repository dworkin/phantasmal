      <h2 class="center"> Non-Described (&quot;nodesc&quot;) Objects </h2>

      <p> You've written some room descriptions and mentioned the far-off
	clouds, or the distant buildings, or the pebbles on the path.
	It'd be nice to have the player able to look at them since you'd
	like to hide important game clues in a few of them and more
	beautifully-written description than you can shake a stick at
	in all of them.  What's a body to do? </p>

      <p> If that body is using Phantasmal version 0.009 through
      0.012, the answer is &quot;learn about descless portables&quot;.
      They work a lot like <a href="Containers.html">containers</a>,
      and can also <i>be</i> containers.  (Note: NoDesc portables are
      likely to be phased out as soon as we have real object details,
      so don't get too attached to them!) </p>

      <p> Let's say you've already created a setting with a need for
	nodesc objects.  For instance, here's a rather lavish one. </p>

<pre>
tomb
Against the wall of the room, a stuffed wombat's mouth gapes eternally.
I mean, there's the rest of the wombat too, but it doesn't properly gape.
Sits, more.  Still.  Peaceful, even.  At least.  Well.  Y'know.  Still.

There's also a large sarcopha- sarca --  a coffin.  And a statue of Ghak'La.
Rumor has it that he's Messy-In-A-Hideous-Way.
*****
- statue of Ghak'La the Messy-In-A-Hideous-Way
- wombat
- a ceremonial dagger

      <p> Notice that your wombat (we'll call it dear little #206) is
	already described in the room, yet
	there it is in the object list.  Boring.  Repetitive.  No
	good at all.  So go ahead and type &quot;set_obj_flag #206 nodesc
	yes&quot;.  Have another look around the room.  See a lack of
	wombat?  Good. </p>

      <p> There are some other side effects.  If you try to take the
	wombat (try it!) you'll get the message &quot;You can't carry
	that!&quot;.  Why?  For starters because it's there in the room
	decription. so people had better be able to keep referring to it.
	You can't pick it up and carry it off or the next
	fellow will type &quot;examine wombat&quot; and won't see one
	here.  He'll feel confused.  He'll feel betrayed.  He'll follow
	it up by deciding you're a guy with a MUD that sucks.  Don't
	be that guy. </p>

      <p> You <i>can</i>, however, put things into and take them out
	of the nodesc object (such as a wombat) if it's also an
	open container.  If you haven't already, you can type
	&quot;set_obj_flag #206 cont yes&quot; and
	&quot;set_obj_flag #206 open 1&quot; to make the wombat
	also be a perfectly usable open container.  Yay!
	Now use that trick to make the statue and sarcophagus have
	descriptions and make sure you can put things into the
	sarcophagus but not into the statue. </p>

      <p> What's next?  You should read old
	<a href="../index.html">tutorials</a> for fun.  It's what I do.
	Far better than having a social life.  Has your MUDLib
	taken over the world yet?  Is it based on Phantasmal?  Is
	it also public domain?  No adulation from eighteen year old
	boy-band fans for you until it is, young man.

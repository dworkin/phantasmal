<h2 class="center">Non-Described ("nodesc") Objects</h2>

<p>You've written some room descriptions and mentioned the far-off
clouds, or the distant buildings, or the pebbles on the path. It'd be
nice to have the player able to look at them since you'd like to hide
important game clues in a few of them and more beautifully-written
description than you can shake a stick at in all of them. What's a body
to do?</p>

<p>If that body is using Phantasmal version 0.009 through 0.012, the
answer is "learn about descless portables". They work a lot like
<a href="Containers.html">containers</a>, and can also <i>be</i>
containers. (Note: NoDesc portables are likely to be phased out as soon
as we have real object details, so don't get too attached to them!)</p>

<p>Let's say you've already created a setting with a need for nodesc
objects. For instance, here's a rather lavish one.</p>
<pre>
tomb
Against the wall of the room, a stuffed wombat's mouth gapes eternally.
I mean, there's the rest of the wombat too, but it doesn't properly gape.
Sits, more.  Still.  Peaceful, even.  At least.  Well.  Y'know.  Still.

There's also a large sarcopha- sarca --  a coffin.  And a statue of Ghak'La.
Rumor has it that he's Messy-In-A-Hideous-Way.
*****
- statue of Ghak'La the Messy-In-A-Hideous-Way
- wombat
- a ceremonial dagger

Exits:

</pre>

<p>Notice that your wombat (we'll call it dear little #206) is already
described in the room, yet there it is in the object list. Boring.
Repetitive. No good at all. So go ahead and type "set_obj_flag #206
nodesc yes". Have another look around the room. See a lack of wombat?
Good.</p>

<p>There are some other side effects. If you try to take the wombat (try
it!) you'll get the message "You can't carry that!". Why? For starters
because it's there in the room decription. so people had better be able
to keep referring to it. You can't pick it up and carry it off or the
next fellow will type "examine wombat" and won't see one here. He'll
feel confused. He'll feel betrayed. He'll follow it up by deciding
you're a guy with a MUD that sucks. Don't be that guy.</p>

<p>You <i>can</i>, however, put things into and take them out of the
nodesc object (such as a wombat) if it's also an open container. If you
haven't already, you can type "set_obj_flag #206 cont yes" and
"set_obj_flag #206 open 1" to make the wombat also be a perfectly usable
open container. Yay! Now use that trick to make the statue and
sarcophagus have descriptions and make sure you can put things into the
sarcophagus but not into the statue.</p>

<p>What's next? You should read old <a href=
"../index.html">tutorials</a> for fun. It's what I do. Far better than
having a social life. Has your MUDLib taken over the world yet? Is it
based on Phantasmal? Is it also public domain? No adulation from
eighteen year old boy-band fans for you until it is, young man.</p>

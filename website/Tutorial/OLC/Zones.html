    <h2 class="center"> Dealing with Zones </h2>

    <p> There's a pretty arcane set of commands in Phantasmal that
      alluded to earlier.  You don't need to use them at all
      most of the time, but to be a good implementor on your
      Phantasmal-based MUD you're going to need to figure them
      out.  Well, that or hand-edit the data files.  But if you
      want to understand the commands, this tutorial is here for
      ya, man. </p>

    <p> That's right.  Zones.  Segments.  And all those commands
      that play with them.  Pretty ugly and scary, huh?  Let's
      hit the basic concepts first, shall we? </p>

    <p> Phantasmal divides all possible object numbers into
      groups of a hundred.  In theory the numbers go up to over
      two billion but most MUDs shouldn't need to come anywhere
      near that.  You can tell what segment an object number is
      in by cutting off the last two digits.  For instance,
      object #374 is in segment 3.  Object #3479234 is in
      segment 34792 and on a very large or very fragmented MUD.
      Object #2147 is in segment 21.  No problem. </p>

    <p> You can see what segments are sitting around by
      type @segmap.  The output might look like this: </p>
    <pre>
Segments:
0      /usr/common/sys/mapd           0
1      /usr/common/sys/exitd          0
2      /usr/common/sys/mapd           0
3      /usr/common/sys/mapd           1
4      /usr/common/sys/mapd           1
5      /usr/common/sys/mobiled        0
--------
    </pre>
    <p>
    The numbers on the left are the segment numbers,
    the filename in the middle is the segment owner,
    and the number on the right tells you what zone
    number that segment is in.  Every segment is in
    one zone or another, though the zone might be
    zero, which means it's not in any interesting
    zone at all. </p>

    <p> So what's in any specific zone?  To find out a
      little, type @zonemap by itself on the command line.
      Your output might look like this: </p>
    <pre>
Zones:
  0: Unzoned
  1: Miskatonic University
  2: Innsmouth
-----
    </pre>
    <p>
    If so, then zone #1 is Miskatonic University and
    zone #2 is Innsmouth.  This zonemap probably belongs
    to a very small Lovecraft-themed MUD. </p>

    <p> Looking at the @segmap above, we see that zone #1 consists
      of segments #3 and #4, or objects #300-#499, inclusive.
      To find out what's there, you can type
      &quot;@list_room world&quot; if you're patient and page through
      'til you get to the zone you care about.  Or you can type
      &quot;@stat #300&quot; -- if there's a room number 300, you can
      then say &quot;@goto #300&quot; to get there.  If there isn't,
      you can make a room #300 (with @make_room or &quot;@new_room
      #300&quot;) and then go there.  Either way, once you're in
      a room in that zone, one with an object number between
      #300 and #499, you can just type &quot;@list_room&quot; and
      get a list of just the objects in that zone. </p>

    <p> What if you want to make a new zone, one nobody's ever
      dealt with before?  You can use the @new_zone command to
      make it if you like.  You'll first need to decide on a zone
      name.  To call it Bob's Big Basement, you'd say
      &quot;@new_zone Bob's Big Basement&quot;.  Type @zonemap to
      make sure you did it right.  Now type %datadump, because you
      really don't want to create a bunch of stuff and then maybe
      lose it.  Save, save, save.  Incidentally, I'm going to
      pretend for the rest of this example that Bob's Big Basement
      was zone #4.  If it came out as a different one (check
      @zonemap to find out) then use that number instead.
    </p>

    <p> Now you want to put something into your new zone.  How?
      First, decide what segments you want it to occupy.  In this
      case, you want all new segments.  There wasn't any owner
      for segment 6, so first of all you can claim segment 6 --
      object #600 through #699, for those of you keeping count.
    </p>

    <p> To do that, first create a new object #600.  You can
      use @make_room, @make_portable, @new_room, @new_portable,
      or probably other commands as well.  No matter how you
      do it, make an object #600.  Do it.  Note that it has
      to be a room, portable or detail -- not an exit or a mobile,
      for instance. </p>

    <p> That means there's now a segment 6.  Type @segmap and
      you'll probably notice that it's in zone 0, and thus
      unzoned.  To change that, you'll use a new nifty command
      you haven't seen before.  Go ahead and type
      &quot;@set_seg_zone #6 #4&quot;.  That should assign
      segment #6 to zone #4 (Bob's Big Basement).  Now you've
      got a new zone, and it's got its own segment.  Do you
      utterly win or what? </p>

    <p> At the moment segments are just a good way to organize
      object numbers so everybody's stuff doesn't get all mixed
      up together.  In the future there'll be a way to set
      security on zones so that only specific builders can mess
      with a given zone, thus keeping other people out of your
      stuff. </p>

    <p> You'll notice that mobiles and exits just allocate
      numbers any way they please rather than paying proper
      attention to zones.  While some of that will eventually
      change, overall mobiles and exits are both harder to
      corral into specific zones than objects are.  We'll
      figure more of this out when we've got permissions,
      we promise.  For the moment just create exits and
      mobiles as though zones didn't exist and you'll find
      that everything works just fine. </p>

      right?  It beats looking through the online help over
      and over and over, and we <i>know</i> you have no
      social life, you MUD programmer, you. </p>

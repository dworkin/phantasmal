    <h2 align="center"> Basic Objects </h2>

    <font size="4">

    <p> You've got exactly as clean a start as you want.  Either way,
      you're ready to mess around and make an object or two.  So
      let's get started with some practical examples. </p>

    <p> The best objects to get started on are rooms.  Trust me.
      So let's make some. </p>

    <p> There's this whole set of segments and a command, @segmap,
      to play with them.  Or you can do it the easy way.  You can
      get help on all that stuff (@help segments, @help @segmap)
      on your own time.  Here we'll do it the easy way. </p>

    <p> Go ahead and type &quot;@make_room&quot; by itself
      on the command line.  You'll be asked a series of questions
      about your room, which you'll need to answer.  For instance,
      first it'll ask you to give it a room number or hit
      enter.  I'd just hit enter if I were you, and you'll get
      the first available room number in the current zone.
      It'll also ask you for a parent for the room.  I'd just
      hit enter again -- you haven't got any specific other room
      set up as a parent room. </p>

    <p> Then it'll ask you for a brief description (type &quot;my
      boudoir&quot;) a glance description (type &quot;my spiffy
      bedroom&quot;) and a look description (type something about
      your bedroom.  Then hit enter again.  Then type a tilde
      (also called a twiddle: &quot;~&quot;) and hit enter again.
    </p>

    <p> Then it'll ask you for an examine description.  Just type
      another twiddle and hit enter again.  That'll default it
      to the look description, which is what you want in this
      example.  For nouns, tell it &quot;boudoir bedroom room&quot;.
      For adjectives tell it &quot;spiffy&quot;. </p>

    <p> Now you've got quite the room going.  Phantasmal will tell
      you something like &quot;room #74 added to Zone #0 (Unzoned)&quot;.
      Take that room number (74 in our example) and stat it.  That is,
      type &quot;@stat #74&quot;.  You'll get something like:

    <pre>
> @stat #74
Location:  (none)
Descriptions (enUS)
Brief:
  'my boudoir'
Glance:
  'my spiffy bedroom'
Look:
  'My bedroom.  It's mine.  All mine!'
Examine:
  (defaults to Look desc)
Nouns (enUS): boudoir bedroom
Adjectives (enUS): spiffy

Contains objects [0]: 
Contains 0 mobiles.

Registered with MAPD as a room.
    </pre>

    <p> Contains no mobiles?  Why that means that you're not
      standing in it.  You should fix that.  Go ahead and
      type &quot;@goto #74&quot;, but make sure to use the
      actual number you got, not necessarily 74. </p>

    <pre>
> @goto #74
You teleport to my boudoir.
my boudoir
My bedroom.  It's mine.  All mine!
*****

Exits: 
    </pre>

    <p> Okay, so now you can give an object a basic description.
      Fair enough.  What else can you do with it?   Well, you can
      move it around.  Go ahead and move it to wherever you're standing --
      type &quot;@move #2 here&quot;, which will teleport it to be inside
      whatever room you're standing in.  You can also teleport it
      somewhere else -- for instance &quot;@move #2 #0&quot; will move
      it into The Void.  You can teleport there (&quot;@goto #0&quot;)
      to make sure it arrived okay. </p>

    <p> You've got nouns and adjectives for it, so if you've teleported
      it into your current room, you can look at it -- type
      &quot;look spiffy bedroom&quot; for instance, or &quot;
      look boudoir&quot;.  You'll find out more about nouns and
      adjectives later, or in the help files for @add_noun and
      @add_adjective. </p>

    <p> If you haven't
      had a look at the build help yet by typing &quot;@help builder&quot;,
      you should. </p>

    <h2 align="center"> Basic Rooms </h2>

    <font size="4">

    <p> Okay, so now you can make a basic room, but you can't <i>do</i>
      much anything with it.  What's next? </p>

    <p> Why <i>exits</i>, of course!  Since you can make rooms and
      mess with their descriptions, next you need to make little
      sets of them.  Lets get started. </p>

    <p> First of all, you should know what rooms are already there.
      The &quot;@list_room&quot; command, typed by itself, should
      give you a nice listing of the ones in your current zone.
      Incidentally, all this stuff
      is in the help -- you <i>are</i> reading the help, right? </p>

    <p>
      So now you want to make your own rooms.  You can make new ones
      by typing &quot;@make_room&quot; just like in the last tutorial,
      or with &quot;@new_room&quot;, the <a href="Objects.html">old
      way</a>.  If you do it the old way, make sure to check out the
      <a href="Zones.html">Zones</a> tutorial at some point, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      So you know how to make rooms, and you can describe them in
      great detail.  Being an experienced MUDder, you know that there
      are commands like &quot;north&quot; and &quot;southeast&quot;
      that are supposed to do their thing, yet not a one of them works
      in the rooms you created.  You even checked the help
      (<i>right</i>?) to make sure that those commands existed, and lo
      and behold they did.
    </p>

    <p> Right.  So.  Exits.  Go to one of your new rooms.  Remember
      the number of another.  I'll call it #37, though you should
      use the actual number of the room you want to connect to the
      room in which you're standing.  From there (hold your
      breath) you type &quot;@new_exit n #37&quot;.  This will
      create an exit north from the current room into room number
      37, and another exit south from room number 37 into this
      one.  Cool, yeah?  In addition to north, south, east
      and west, you can use exit names like northwest, southeast,
      up, down, in and out for a little more variety.  The exit
      back <i>to</i> the room you're standing in will always be
      opposite the direction you type on the command line. </p>

    <p> Using this same trick repeatedly, you can connect your little maze
      of rooms together.  How cool does that make you?  You can also find
      out what exits are in the MUD by typing @list_exits, though
      that doesn't currently say where the exit
      comes from, only where it goes to. </p>

    <p> What next?  Why more <a href="../index.html">tutorials</a>,
      of course! </p>

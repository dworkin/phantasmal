<h2>Basic Rooms</h2>

<p>Okay, so now you can make a basic room, but you can't <i>do</i>
much anything with it. What's next?</p>

<p>Why <i>exits</i>, of course! Since you can make rooms and mess
with their descriptions, next you need to make little sets of them.
Lets get started.</p>

<p>First of all, you should know what rooms are already there. The
"@list_room" command, typed by itself, should give you a nice
listing of the ones in your current zone. Incidentally, all this
stuff is in the help -- you <i>are</i> reading the help, right?</p>

<p>So now you want to make your own rooms. You can make new ones by
typing "@make_room" just like in the last tutorial, or with
"@new_room", the <a href="Objects.html">old way</a>. If you do it
the old way, make sure to check out the <a href=
"Zones.html">Zones</a> tutorial at some point, too.</p>

<p>So you know how to make rooms, and you can describe them in
great detail. Being an experienced MUDder, you know that there are
commands like "north" and "southeast" that are supposed to do their
thing, yet not a one of them works in the rooms you created. You
even checked the help (<i>right</i>?) to make sure that those
commands existed, and lo and behold they did.</p>

<p>Right. So. Exits. Go to one of your new rooms. Remember the
number of another. I'll call it #37, though you should use the
actual number of the room you want to connect to the room in which
you're standing. From there (hold your breath) you type "@new_exit
n #37". This will create an exit north from the current room into
room number 37, and another exit south from room number 37 into
this one. Cool, yeah? In addition to north, south, east and west,
you can use exit names like northwest, southeast, up, down, in and
out for a little more variety. The exit back <i>to</i> the room
you're standing in will always be opposite the direction you type
on the command line.</p>

<p>Using this same trick repeatedly, you can connect your little
maze of rooms together. How cool does that make you? You can also
find out what exits are in the MUD by typing @list_exits, though
that doesn't currently say where the exit comes from, only where it
goes to.</p>

<p>An important disclaimer: this is the <b>old</b> way to make
exits, and has been superceded by a <a href="Exits.html">newer</a>
one which you should use instead. This will stop working at some
point in favor of the new kind of exits. You have been warned.</p>

<p>What next? Why more <a href="../index.html">tutorials</a>, of
course!</p>

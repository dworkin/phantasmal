    <h2 class="center"> Height, Weight and Volume </h2>

    <p>
      Height, Weight and Volume are the new black jeans -- everybody's
      wearing them casually.  Or maybe they're the new black.  Or the
      new HTTP.  Nah, never mind, I'm just lost with all these trends.
      They're certainly the <i>old</i> height, weight and volume,
      whatever else they may be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weight and volume are pretty easy, and their capacities make
      sense.  If a bag (or even a room) has a certain weight capacity,
      you can only put that much weight in.  Beyond that, Phantasmal
      will tell you that there's too much an no more will go in.
      The same applies to volume -- a given container will only hold
      so much, and no more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Height is a little funky.  Height doesn't add up in the same
      way, so if a quiver is marked as having a height capacity of
      1 meter and you put in an arrow that's half a meter, you can
      put in two -- and then as many more as you have weight or
      volume for.  So if the quiver holds fifteen pounds and each
      arrow weighs a half-pound, you can put in thirty arrows, even
      though the quiver only has a height capacity of a single meter
      and each arrow is a half-meter.  However, the quiver won't
      hold even one single 1.5-meter javelin.  The javelin is over
      the height limit, so it won't fit, arrows or no.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may have noticed me combining American and metric units in
      that last paragraph.  The OLC system tries to accept all kinds
      of units, but everything gets converted internally to
      centimeters (for length), liters (for volume) and kilograms (for
      weight).  Yes, we know that kilograms are actually a unit of
      mass, and we simply pretend that all mass is converted to weight
      as it would be at sea level on earth.  That means gravity,
      <i>for these conversions</i>, is 1 G, or 9.8 meters per second
      per second, just like on Earth at sea level.  Yes, even if the
      local gravity may be different in some specific area of the MUD.
      Are you happy, all you physics buffs out in the audience?
    </p>

    <p>
      You've been making objects for awhile here, at least if you're
      reading and doing the tutorials in order.  So you've seen
      where height, weight and volume get set when you're making
      an object, and where their capacities get set if you're making
      a container.  Feel free to make some containers with specific
      heights and weights and play with putting stuff into them
      and taking it out.  I expect that'll keep you entertained for
      at least a couple of minutes :-)
    </p>

    <p>
      Height, weight and volume can also be inherited.  So if you
      make an object and you assign it a parent, you'll have the
      option in creating it of just defaulting its height, weight
      and volume to that of the parent.  This may or may not be
      of any use to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      So how do you check this stuff?  The <b>stat</b> command will
      tell you an object's height, weight and volume, and will show
      you the capacities for same if the object is a container.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other thing you may want to do is edit the values.  There's
      a small family of commands for exactly that purpose that you'll
      want to become acquainted with.  They have names like
      <b>@set_obj_height</b>, <b>@set_obj_length</b>, and for
      capacities, things like <b>@set_obj_weight_cap</b> and
      <b>@set_obj_height_capacity</b>.  They work pretty much exactly
      as you'd expect, but you can check the online help if you need
      more instruction in their use.

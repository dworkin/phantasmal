@@TITLE Exits@@

<h2>Basic Portables</h2>

<p>You've done a fair bit with rooms, portables and maybe even a
creature or two, but still you need to hook it all up with more
interesting exits. Let's talk about how you can do that.</p>

<p>There are several interesting things about exits, so we'll hit
them in no particular order.</p>

<h3>Deferred Exits</h3>

<p>Sometimes when you load a zone or other area, not every exit can
resolve. For instance, there's a command called @load_rooms which
will let you load just certain rooms from a zone. That can be
useful when you're testing particular rooms. But if you load just a
few specific rooms from a zone, then those rooms are going to have
exits that lead to nowhere... When that happens, you get what are
called "deferred" exits.</p>

<p>You can determine if you've got any of those wacky deferred
exits by typing <b>@check_deferred</b> by itself on the command
line. If you have some, you can type <b>@add_deferred</b> or
<b>@add_deferred_exits</b> to resolve the deferred exits and make
them appear as 'real' exits. Note that the rooms at <i>both</i>
ends of the exit must exist for <b>@add_deferred</b> to work. If
you can't resolve and add all your deferred exits,
<b>@add_deferred_exits</b> will tell you so.</p>

<h3>Old-style and New-style Exits</h3>

<p>If you have some exits added the <a href="Rooms.html">old</a>
way, with @new_exit, you'll want to convert them over to the new
style. Simply type <b>@fix_exits</b> and all old-style exits should
be painlessly and immediately converted.</p>

<h3>Removing Exits</h3>

<p>Sometimes you'd like to get rid of an exit you've already
created. The command <b>@clear_exits</b> will delete every exit
coming from this room. If you'd like to be more specific, you can
type "@remove_exit &lt;dir&gt;" where dir is a direction like
"northwest" or "sw" or "d". An exit in that direction will be
removed.</p>

<h3>One-way and Two-way Exits</h3>

<p>You can use the <b>@new_oneway_exit</b> and
<b>@new_twoway_exit</b> commands to make new-style one- or two-way
exits. The syntax is like <b>@new_exit</b> --
"@new_&lt;num&gt;way_exit &lt;dir&gt; #&lt;room num&gt;". For
instance, "@new_oneway_exit sw #344" would create a new one-way
exit from this room, heading southwest, and ending in room #344.
The two-way exit version would also create a return exit.</p>

<h2 class="center">Basic Portables</h2>

<p>You've done a fair bit with rooms, portables and maybe even a
creature or two, but still you need to hook it all up with more
interesting exits. Let's talk about how you can do that.</p>

<p>There are several interesting things about exits, so we'll hit them
in no particular order.</p>

<h3 class="center">Deferred Exits</h3>

<p>Sometimes when you load a zone or other area, not every exit can
resolve. For instance, there's a command called @load_rooms which will
let you load just certain rooms from a zone. That can be useful when
you're testing particular rooms. But if you load just a few specific
rooms from a zone, then those rooms are going to have exits that lead to
nowhere... When that happens, you get what are called "deferred"
exits.</p>

<p>You can determine if you've got any of those wacky deferred exits by
typing <b>@check_deferred</b> by itself on the command line. If you have
some, you can type <b>@add_deferred</b> or <b>@add_deferred_exits</b> to
resolve the deferred exits and make them appear as 'real' exits. Note
that the rooms at <i>both</i> ends of the exit must exist for
<b>@add_deferred</b> to work. If you can't resolve and add all your
deferred exits, <b>@add_deferred_exits</b> will tell you so.</p>

<h3 class="center">Old-style and New-style Exits</h3>

<p>If you have some exits added the <a href="Rooms.html">old</a> way,
with @new_exit, you'll want to convert them over to the new style.
Simply type <b>@fix_exits</b> and all old-style exits should be
painlessly and immediately converted.</p>

<h3 class="center">Removing Exits</h3>

<p>Sometimes you'd like to get rid of an exit you've already created.
The command <b>@clear_exits</b> will delete every exit coming from this
room. If you'd like to be more specific, you can type "@remove_exit
&lt;dir&gt;" where dir is a direction like "northwest" or "sw" or "d".
An exit in that direction will be removed.</p>

<h3 class="center">One-way and Two-way Exits</h3>

<p>You can use the <b>@new_oneway_exit</b> and <b>@new_twoway_exit</b>
commands to make new-style one- or two-way exits. The syntax is like
<b>@new_exit</b> -- "@new_&lt;num&gt;way_exit &lt;dir&gt; #&lt;room
num&gt;". For instance, "@new_oneway_exit sw #344" would create a new
one-way exit from this room, heading southwest, and ending in room #344.
The two-way exit version would also create a return exit.</p>

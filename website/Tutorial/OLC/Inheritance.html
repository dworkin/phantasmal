    <p><i>Note: a lot of this is new to Phantasmal 0.016.  If you're
      still using a previous version, allow me to recommend the <a

      than this one. </i> </p>

    <p>
      One way to potentially save yourself some time, when building
      objects that have some relationship to each other, is to build a
      parent object for some or all of them.  If you're building a
      large number of sun-drenched rooms in an outdoor labyrinth then
      lots of them are likely to have grass, sunlight, a hedge, a view
      of a tower and so on.  You can put all those various details
      into a single parent object and make your tens or hundreds of
      labyrinth rooms all implement them automatically.  This tutorial
      can show you how.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a time-saver, inheritance is primarily a way to inherit <a
      href="Details.html">object details</a>.  That's a useful thing,
      but it doesn't do everything.  Object nouns and adjectives will
      also be inheritable as of Phantasmal 0.016.  Things like weights
      and heights already are.  We're considering inheriting object
      descriptions, but it's not entirely clear how the commands for
      that should work.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, back to that sun-drenched labyrinth.  You're going to need a
      parent room, which should be clearly marked as such and not
      connected (via exits) to any other room anywhere.  That keeps
      people from randomly walking into it and changing stuff.  So use
      <b>@make_room</b> to make the parent room.  Your parent rooms
      are allowed to have their own parents, but in this example
      there's probably no reason to bother.  Take note of the parent
      room's object number when <b>@make_room</b> tells you what it
      is.
    </p>

    <p>
      For your brief and glance descriptions you should put something
      like &quot;labyrinth parent room&quot;, and for your look
      description you should put something like &quot;this room
      contains details for other labyrinth rooms.  You should never,
      never be able to enter it.&quot; You shouldn't add any exits to
      or from it.  Remember that if anybody ever changes something
      here it will be propagated to all your child rooms, so only
      change the parent room if you actually <i>mean</i> to.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll also want an ordinary labyrinth test room to try out the
      nifty inheritance tricks.  Go ahead and create one with
      <b>@make_room</b>.  Up to this point, when <b>@make_room</b>
      asks you for a parent object, you've probably just been hitting
      enter to leave it blank.  And that's been the right thing to do.
      But when you make the labyrinth test room, you should instead
      type the number of the labyrinth parent room -- the one we told
      you to take note of awhile back.  You wrote it down when
      <b>@make_room</b> told it to you, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      The description can be whatever you like, but for the full
      example experience, I recommend mentioning sunshine and a
      distant tower in the description.  That way people can look
      at them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, go ahead and make a new detail with <b>@make_detail</b>.
      Make it a part of the labyrinth <i>parent</i> room, not the
      labyrinth <i>test</i> room.  Describe the sunshine playing on
      the grass and hedges, and how you can see the dust motes
      swirling in it.  Give the sunshine nouns like <b>sun</b>,
      <b>sunshine</b>, <b>dust</b> and <b>motes</b>, and adjectives
      like <b>bright</b>, <b>shiny</b> and <b>dust</b>.  That's so
      that you can look at the dust motes, the shiny motes or the
      sunshine and get the same description back.
    </p>

    <p>
      To test it out, go to the labyrinth parent room and look at the
      dust motes.  Now go back to the labyrinth test room and do the
      same.  If you want, go ahead and add more details to the
      labyrinth parent room for things like grass, the tower, the
      hedges and the other stuff you can see.  If you were a <a
      href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> builder doing a Castle
      Marrach room you'd be spending two or three hours at least on
      all the descriptions, so don't be shy about taking ten or
      fifteen minutes on this.  Your best role-players will eat this
      stuff up.  And remember, every minute you spend on the details
      in the parent room is that much more detail in <i>every</i> child
      room.  That's how inheritance in Phantasmal saves you time!
    </p>

    <p>
      So test it out.  Make another child room.  That's another room
      like the labyrinth test room, one that also inherits from the
      labyrinth parent room (whose number you still remember, yeah?).
      After making this fresh-minted room with <b>@make_room</b>
      and giving it the labyrinth parent room as a parent, go ahead
      and look around at the grass, the dust motes, and everything
      else you made details for.  And there they are!
    </p>

    <p>
      Note how just by making a room with a cool parent, you've
      suddenly gotten a lot of details for free.  This is inheritance,
      but it's not the kind you're used to in an Object Oriented
      programming language (just in case you're a programmer).  That
      kind of inheritance is also called <b>code inheritance</b>
      because it's code being inherited.  Those languages almost never
      allow <b>data inheritance</b>, which is what you're seeing here
      in Phantasmal.  That's because these details are object data,
      not methods or any other kind of code.  MUDs tend to be better
      served by data inheritance, at least for &quot;physical&quot;
      objects in the MUD world.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if you want to make a room that's a little different?
      Let's say you want a cool, shady labyrinth room in one specific
      place, but you'd like the grass, the view of the tower and so on
      to stay the same.  Make a new room and call it &quot;shady
      labyrinth room&quot;.  Describe it appropriately.  But make sure
      that its parent is still the same labyrinth parent.  So to start
      out with, it looks just like the other sunny labyrinth rooms.
      How do you change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      First, add a detail to the new shady room.  You might give it
      nouns like 'hedge', 'shade' and 'shadow', and adjectives like
      'shady' and 'cool'.  Then when a player looks at the cool shadow
      or the shady hedge, he'll see the new shady version.  Check out
      your new room with the <b>@stat</b> command -- you should see
      a detail list with the new detail, and also a detail list with
      the full set of details from the parent as well.
      </p>

    <p> But you'd like to get rid of the sunshine and dust motes
      above, since they shouldn't be here, or shouldn't look the same.
      To do that, remove the detail from the child object.  That's
      right: <i>remove the parent's detail from the child object</i>.
      Each child object keeps a list of parent details that it
      overrides -- details that the parent has, but the child does
      not.  By removing the parent's detail, you add the removed
      detail to that internal list.  Doublecheck with <b>@stat</b>.
      The parent detail for sunshine and dust motes should be gone.
    </p>

    <h3> Multiple Inheritance </h3>

    <p>
      An object can have more than one parent.  Some attributes like
      weight, height, weight_capacity and so on are inherited entirely
      from the first parent.  Other attributes like nouns and details
      are combined from all parents.  If you wanted to make certain
      labyrinth rooms shady and other sunny, and make certain rooms
      large and others small, you could make large and small parent
      rooms, and shady and sunny parent rooms, then inherit from
      either large or small and either shady or sunny to combine them.
      The volume capacity of the room (and thus, how many players may
      be inside it at once) is set from the first parent, which would
      be either large or small.  However, the details are from
      <i>all</i> parents, so the room would also inherit the shady or
      sunny detail objects from the shady or sunny rooms.  Additional
      parent objects that add extra details, nouns, adjectives, etc
      are called <b>mixin</b> objects, or <b>mixin</b> parents because
      the mix additional details in without interacting directly with
      the other parent classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually it's easier to inherit another room from a parent object
      before having the child inherit it than to make mixin objects.
      For instance, if all rooms were the same size but you had both
      shady and sunny rooms, then you could make a &quot;labyrinth
      room&quot; parent, and then inherit shady and sunny children
      from it.  However, if you have multiple attributes that vary
      independently, you may find a mixin parent is easiest.  For
      instance, you could have <i>shady, small</i> rooms, <i>sunny,
      large</i> rooms, <i>shady, large</i> rooms or <i>sunny,
      small</i> rooms in the above, so it made sense.  If every small
      room is also shady and every large room is also sunny, you're
      probably better off avoiding multiple inheritance -- it can be
      complicated to use.  The single-inheritance solution is easier.
    </p>

    <h3> The @set_object_parent command </h3>

    <p>
      The only other thing you should know about inheritance is the
      way to change or remove object parents.  The
      <b>@set_obj_parent</b> command is your friend here (check its
      online help!).  You can set an object #1124's parent to object
      #375 by saying &quot;@set_obj_parent #1124 set #375&quot;.  You
      can then make it parentless again by saying
      &quot;@set_obj_parent #1124 none&quot;.  You can set multiple
      parents by saying &quot;@set_obj_par #1124 add #391 #241&quot;,
      or &quot;@set_obj_par #1124 set #375 #391 #241&quot;.  Note that
      the order of the parents matters, and that added parents are
      appended to the <i>end</i> of the list.

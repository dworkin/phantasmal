      <h2 class="center"> Basic Objects the Old Way </h2>

	<p> Phantasmal originally did its creation and editing of new
	  objects with a command-line syntax for setting all the
	  individual fields.  Phantasmal has started the sea-change
	  to the newer, easier way but it can still be a good idea
	  to know the old syntax.  The new way may not have the
	  to-die-for absolute latest feature you're looking for, or
	  you may just find the old one more convenient for minor
	  edits.
	</p>

	<p> Go ahead and type &quot;@new_room #2&quot;.  It doesn't have
	  to be room number 2, but this example will assume you cleared a
	  bunch of stuff out.  If you didn't, pick a free number other
	  than two, or just type &quot;@new_room&quot; and let the MUD
	  assign you a new room in whatever zone you're currently
	  standing in. </p>

      <p> So let's make it more interesting.  Type &quot;@stat #2&quot;
	which will show you some things about your room.  It probably looks
	pretty generic at this point.  Mine looks like this: </p>
<pre>
> @stat #2
Location:  (none)
Descriptions (enUS)
Brief:
  'a room'
Glance:
  'a room'
Look:
  'You see a room here.'
Examine:
  (defaults to Look desc)
Nouns (enUS): 
Adjectives (enUS): 

Contains objects [0]: 
Contains 0 mobiles.

Registered with MAPD as a room.
</pre>
      <p>
	That means it's nowhere, it contains nothing, its descriptions
	are quite generic, it has no nouns or adjectives.
	And what's &quot;enUS&quot;? </p>

      <p> Patience, grasshopper.  Type &quot;@goto #2&quot;  You'll
	show up in your room.  For me, it looks like this: </p>
<pre>
> @goto #2
You teleport to a room.
a room
You see a room here.
*****

Exits: 
</pre>
      <p>
	Now type &quot;@set_brief #2 my boudoir&quot;.  And then
	type &quot;look&quot;  You'll notice the room's name changed.
	You can also type &quot;@stat #2&quot; to see the same change. </p>

      <p> Type &quot;@set_look #2&quot;.  You'll see something like
	this: </p>
<pre>
> @set_look #2
Locale is US english
Enter text at the prompt.  Enter ~ on a line by itself to end.
 >
</pre>

      <p>
	Type several lines of description for your room.  Then, after
	hitting return on the last one, go ahead and type a tilde (~)
	and hit return.  That should finish off the description,
	which you're now stuck with until next time you change it.
	In addition to @set_brief and @set_look, there's @set_glance
	and @set_examine.  I highly recommend their @help files.
      </p>

      <p> Okay, so now you can give an object a basic description.
	  Fair enough.  What else can you do with it?   Well, you can
	  move it around.  Go ahead and move it to wherever you're standing --
	  type &quot;@move #2 here&quot;, which will teleport it to be inside
	  whatever room you're standing in.  You can also teleport it
	  somewhere else -- for instance &quot;@move #2 #0&quot; will move
	  it into The Void.  You can teleport there (&quot;@goto #0&quot;)
	  to make sure it arrived okay. </p>

      <p> You can also add nouns and adjectives to it, but we'll
	cover that in the section on <a href="Portables.html">portables</a>.
	If you haven't
	had a look at the build help yet by typing &quot;@help builder&quot;
	I highly recommend it. </p>

    <h2 class="center"> Object Inheritance </h2>

    <p>
      One way to potentially save yourself some time, when building
      objects that have some relationship to each other, is to build a
      parent object for some or all of them.  For instance if you're
      building a large number of sun-drenched rooms in an outdoor
      labyrinth somewhere then an awfully large number of them are
      likely to have grass, sunlight, a hedge, a view of a tower and
      so on.  You can put all those various details into a single
      parent object and make your tens or hundreds of labyrinth rooms
      all implement them automatically.  This tutorial can show you
      how.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, inheritance is primarily a way to inherit <a
      href="Details.html">object details</a>.  That's a useful thing,
      but it doesn't do everything.  We hope that object nouns and
      adjectives will also be inheritable soon.  Things like weights,
      heights, etc should already be.  We're considering object
      descriptions, but it's not entirely clear how that should
      work.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, back to that sun-drenched labyrinth.  You're going to need a
      parent room, which should be clearly marked as such and not
      connected (via exits) to any other room anywhere, to avoid
      people randomly walking into it and changing stuff.  So use
      <b>@make_room</b> to make just such a thing.  Your parent rooms
      are allowed to have their own parents, but in this example
      there's probably no reason to bother.  Take note of the parent
      room's object number, when you find out what it is.
    </p>

    <p>
      For your brief and glance descriptions you should put something
      like &quot;labyrinth parent room&quot;, and for your look
      description you should put something like &quot;this room
      contains details for other labyrinth rooms.  You should never,
      never be able to enter it.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll also want an ordinary labyrinth test room to try out the
      nifty inheritance tricks.  Go ahead and create one with
      <b>@make_room</b>.  Up to this point, when <b>@make_room</b>
      asks you for a parent object, you've probably just been hitting
      enter to leave it blank.  And that's been the right thing to do.
      But when you make the labyrinth test room, you should instead
      type the number of the labyrinth parent room -- the one we told
      you to take note of awhile back.  You did, right?
    </p>

    <p>
      The description can be whatever you like, but for the full
      example experience, I recommend mentioning sunshine and a
      distant tower in the desc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, go ahead and make a new detail with <b>@make_detail</b>.
      Make it a part of the labyrinth <i>parent</i> room, not the
      labyrinth <i>test</i> room.  Describe the sunshine playing on
      the grass and hedges, and how you can see the dust motes playing
      in it.  Give it nouns like <b>sun</b>, <b>sunshine</b>,
      <b>dust</b> and <b>motes</b>, and adjectives like <b>bright</b>,
      <b>shiny</b> and <b>dust</b> (so that you can look at the
      dust motes and get the same desc).
    </p>

    <p>
      To test it out, go to the labyrinth parent room and look at the
      dust motes.  Now go back to the labyrinth test room and do the
      same.  If you want, go ahead and add more details to the
      labyrinth parent rooms for things like grass, the tower, the
      hedges and the other stuff you can see.  In a <a
      href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> room you'd be spending
      two or three hours at least on all the descriptions, so don't be
      shy about taking ten or fifteen minutes on this.  Players eat
      this stuff up.  And remember, every minute you spend on the
      details in the parent room is that much more detail in <i>every
      child room</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So test it out.  Make another child room.  That's another room
      like the labyrinth test room, one that also inherits from the
      labyrinth parent room (whose number you still remember, yeah?).
      After making this fresh-minted room with <b>@make_room</b>
      and giving it the labyrinth parent room as a parent, go ahead
      and look around at the grass, the dust motes, and everything
      else you made details for.  And there they are!
    </p>

    <p>
      Note how just by making a room with a cool parent, you've
      suddenly gotten a lot of details for free.  This is inheritance,
      but it's not the kind you're used to in an Object Oriented
      programming language (just in case you're a programmer).  That
      kind of inheritance is also called <b>code inheritance</b>
      because it's code being inherited.  Those languages almost never
      allow <b>data inheritance</b>, which is what you're seeing here
      in Phantasmal.  That's because these details are object data,
      not methods or any other kind of code.  MUDs tend to be better
      served by data inheritance, at least for &quot;physical&quot;
      objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only other thing you should know about inheritance is the
      way to change or remove object parents.  The
      <b>@set_obj_parent</b> command is your friend here (check its
      online help!).  You can set an object #1124's parent to object
      #375 by saying &quot;@set_obj_parent #1124 #375&quot;.  You can
      then make it parentless again by saying &quot;@set_obj_parent
      #1124 #-1&quot; or (in recent versions of Phantasmal)
      &quot;@set_obj_parent #1124 none&quot;.

    <h2 class="center"> Basic Portables </h2>

    <p> So now you've got some rooms.  You should put some plunderable
      objects in them, naturally.  Stuff you can pick up and carry
      around is a fine thing. </p>

    <p> You can make a quick, simple portable object by typing
      &quot;@new_room&quot;.  The whole weird segment thing
      still applies. </p>

    <p> You can do a lot of the same things you do with rooms --
      @set_brief, @set_glance, @set_look, @set_examine, @stat,
      @move, and even @goto -- but they do slightly different
      things in some cases.  For instance, the brief description
      is what the object looks like when it's in the room, and
      not usually the room description.  You can add exits to
      portables, but they're only usable from <i>inside</i>
      the portable, so that's usually pretty pointless. </p>

    <p> You can list portables with @list_portables.  About the
      only other cool stuff you can do with portables is to
      make them containers -- more on that in another tutorial.
    </p>

    <p> Once there's a portable around, the obvious thing to
      do is to pick it up.  For instance: </p>
    <pre>

> @new_port
Added portable #204.

> @set_brief #204 a root  
Locale is US english
Setting brief desc on object #204

> @set_glance #204 a chunk of root
Locale is US english
Setting glance desc on object #204

> @set_look #204
Locale is US english
Enter text at the prompt.  Enter ~ on a line by itself to end.
 > You see a chunk of root with bits of dirt still clinging to it.  You 
 > don't know enough about roots to identify it very well, though a lot
 > of bark is still attached, as well as some tiny little hairy rootlets.
 > ~
Set look description.

> @add_noun #204 root rootlet chunk
Adding nouns (enUS).
Done.

> @add_adj #204 dirty hairy
Adding adjectives (enUS).
Done.

> get hairy root
You get a chunk of root.

> drop dirty root
You drop a chunk of root.

> examine root
You see a chunk of root with bits of dirt still clinging to it.  You
don't know enough about roots to identify it very well, though a lot
of bark is still attached, as well as some tiny little hairy rootlets.

    </pre>
    Did you catch that bit with @add_noun and @add_adj?  You can
    use those commands to add lists of nouns and adjectives
    to an object, and then refer to the object by any number of
    its adjectives followed by one of its nouns.  For instance:
    <pre>

> @add_noun #204 turnip root tuber vegetable
Adding nouns (enUS).
Done.

> @add_adj #204 small shriveled sere wrinkled withered dry old dried
Adding adjectives (enUS).
Done.

> look old dry withered wrinkled root
This turnip has seen much better days!  It's wrinkled, shriveled up and
generally very, very unappetizing.

> get turnip
You get a wrinkled, dry turnip.

> drop dried tuber
You drop a wrinkled, dry turnip.

    </pre>

    <p> Now you can make nifty objects and pick them up, drop them
      and so on for yourself.  Go ahead, give it a go.

<h2>Containers</h2>

<p>You've got basic objects. You long ago realized how cool being
able to play with objects and put them inside each other is. You
want this capability for your very own. This tutorial can help.</p>

<p>To make a container, first make a portable. You <a href=
"Portables.html">remember</a> how to do that, I'm sure. Just
mention things in its description that make it sound like a
container -- call it a bag, or a breadbox, or a sleeping pod, or
whatever seems like you could put stuff in it.</p>

<p>Okay. So you've got your portable object. I'll call it object
#210, a large breadbox in the example below.</p>
<pre>

&gt; @set_obj_flag #210 cont 1
Done.

&gt; @set_obj_flag #210 open true
Done.

&gt; @stat #210
Location: #4 (an old tunnel)

<p>See? Easy. The trick is the @set_obj_flags lines to create a
container and open it. There'll be better commands for this stuff
eventually, probably...</p>

<p>What do you read now? More <a href="../index.html">tutorials</a>
as they're written, or you can start <i>finally</i> reading the
help files. They're worth it. Really. Seriously. I promise. I wrote
them.</p>

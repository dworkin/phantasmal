<h2>Height, Weight and Volume</h2>

<p>Height, Weight and Volume are the new black jeans -- everybody's
wearing them casually. Or maybe they're the new black. Or the new
HTTP. Nah, never mind, I'm just lost with all these trends. They're
certainly the <i>old</i> height, weight and volume, whatever else
they may be.</p>

<p>Weight and volume are pretty easy, and their capacities make
sense. If a bag (or even a room) has a certain weight capacity, you
can only put that much weight in. Beyond that, Phantasmal will tell
you that there's too much an no more will go in. The same applies
to volume -- a given container will only hold so much, and no
more.</p>

<p>Height is a little funky. Height doesn't add up in the same way,
so if a quiver is marked as having a height capacity of 1 meter and
you put in an arrow that's half a meter, you can put in two -- and
then as many more as you have weight or volume for. So if the
quiver holds fifteen pounds and each arrow weighs a half-pound, you
can put in thirty arrows, even though the quiver only has a height
capacity of a single meter and each arrow is a half-meter. However,
the quiver won't hold even one single 1.5-meter javelin. The
javelin is over the height limit, so it won't fit, arrows or
no.</p>

<p>You may have noticed me combining American and metric units in
that last paragraph. The OLC system tries to accept all kinds of
units, but everything gets converted internally to centimeters (for
length), liters (for volume) and kilograms (for weight). Yes, we
know that kilograms are actually a unit of mass, and we simply
pretend that all mass is converted to weight as it would be at sea
level on earth. That means gravity, <i>for these conversions</i>,
is 1 G, or 9.8 meters per second per second, just like on Earth at
sea level. Yes, even if the local gravity may be different in some
specific area of the MUD. Are you happy, all you physics buffs out
in the audience?</p>

<p>You've been making objects for awhile here, at least if you're
reading and doing the tutorials in order. So you've seen where
height, weight and volume get set when you're making an object, and
where their capacities get set if you're making a container. Feel
free to make some containers with specific heights and weights and
play with putting stuff into them and taking it out. I expect
that'll keep you entertained for at least a couple of minutes
:-)</p>

<p>Height, weight and volume can also be inherited. So if you make
an object and you assign it a parent, you'll have the option in
creating it of just defaulting its height, weight and volume to
that of the parent. This may or may not be of any use to you.</p>

<p>So how do you check this stuff? The <b>stat</b> command will
tell you an object's height, weight and volume, and will show you
the capacities for same if the object is a container.</p>

<p>The other thing you may want to do is edit the values. There's a
small family of commands for exactly that purpose that you'll want
to become acquainted with. They have names like
<b>@set_obj_height</b>, <b>@set_obj_length</b>, and for capacities,
things like <b>@set_obj_weight_cap</b> and
<b>@set_obj_height_capacity</b>. They work pretty much exactly as
you'd expect, but you can check the online help if you need more
instruction in their use.</p>

<h2 class="center">Basic Objects the Old Way</h2>

<p>Phantasmal originally did its creation and editing of new objects
with a command-line syntax for setting all the individual fields.
Phantasmal has started the sea-change to the newer, easier way but it
can still be a good idea to know the old syntax. The new way may not
have the to-die-for absolute latest feature you're looking for, or you
may just find the old one more convenient for minor edits.</p>

<p>Go ahead and type "@new_room #2". It doesn't have to be room number
2, but this example will assume you cleared a bunch of stuff out. If you
didn't, pick a free number other than two, or just type "@new_room" and
let the MUD assign you a new room in whatever zone you're currently
standing in.</p>

<p>So let's make it more interesting. Type "@stat #2" which will show
you some things about your room. It probably looks pretty generic at
this point. Mine looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @stat #2
Location:  (none)
Descriptions (enUS)
Brief:
  'a room'
Glance:
  'a room'
Look:
  'You see a room here.'
Examine:
  (defaults to Look desc)
Nouns (enUS): 
Adjectives (enUS): 

Contains objects [0]: 
Contains 0 mobiles.

Registered with MAPD as a room.
</pre>

<p>That means it's nowhere, it contains nothing, its descriptions are
quite generic, it has no nouns or adjectives. And what's "enUS"?</p>

<p>Patience, grasshopper. Type "@goto #2" You'll show up in your room.
For me, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @goto #2
You teleport to a room.
a room
You see a room here.
*****

Exits: 
</pre>

<p>Now type "@set_brief #2 my boudoir". And then type "look" You'll
notice the room's name changed. You can also type "@stat #2" to see the
same change.</p>

<p>Type "@set_look #2". You'll see something like this:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @set_look #2
Locale is US english
Enter text at the prompt.  Enter ~ on a line by itself to end.
 &gt;
</pre>

<p>Type several lines of description for your room. Then, after hitting
return on the last one, go ahead and type a tilde (~) and hit return.
That should finish off the description, which you're now stuck with
until next time you change it. In addition to @set_brief and @set_look,
there's @set_glance and @set_examine. I highly recommend their @help
files.</p>

<p>Okay, so now you can give an object a basic description. Fair enough.
What else can you do with it? Well, you can move it around. Go ahead and
move it to wherever you're standing -- type "@move #2 here", which will
teleport it to be inside whatever room you're standing in. You can also
teleport it somewhere else -- for instance "@move #2 #0" will move it
into The Void. You can teleport there ("@goto #0") to make sure it
arrived okay.</p>

<p>You can also add nouns and adjectives to it, but we'll cover that in
the section on <a href="Portables.html">portables</a>. If you haven't
had a look at the build help yet by typing "@help builder" I highly
recommend it.</p>

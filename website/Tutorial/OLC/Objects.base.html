<h2>Basic Objects the Old Way</h2>

<p>Phantasmal originally did its creation and editing of new
objects with a command-line syntax for setting all the individual
fields. Phantasmal has started the sea-change to the newer, easier
way but it can still be a good idea to know the old syntax. The new
way may not have the to-die-for absolute latest feature you're
looking for, or you may just find the old one more convenient for
minor edits.</p>

<p>Go ahead and type "@new_room #2". It doesn't have to be room
number 2, but this example will assume you cleared a bunch of stuff
out. If you didn't, pick a free number other than two, or just type
"@new_room" and let the MUD assign you a new room in whatever zone
you're currently standing in.</p>

<p>So let's make it more interesting. Type "@stat #2" which will
show you some things about your room. It probably looks pretty
generic at this point. Mine looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @stat #2
Location:  (none)
Descriptions (enUS)
Brief:
  'a room'
Glance:
  'a room'
Look:
  'You see a room here.'
Examine:
  (defaults to Look desc)
Nouns (enUS): 
Adjectives (enUS): 

Contains objects [0]: 
Contains 0 mobiles.

Registered with MAPD as a room.
</pre>

<p>That means it's nowhere, it contains nothing, its descriptions
are quite generic, it has no nouns or adjectives. And what's
"enUS"?</p>

<p>Patience, grasshopper. Type "@goto #2" You'll show up in your
room. For me, it looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @goto #2
You teleport to a room.
a room
You see a room here.
*****

Exits: 
</pre>

<p>Now type "@set_brief #2 my boudoir". And then type "look" You'll
notice the room's name changed. You can also type "@stat #2" to see
the same change.</p>

<p>Type "@set_look #2". You'll see something like this:</p>
<pre>
&gt; @set_look #2
Locale is US english
Enter text at the prompt.  Enter ~ on a line by itself to end.
 &gt;
</pre>

<p>Type several lines of description for your room. Then, after
hitting return on the last one, go ahead and type a tilde (~) and
hit return. That should finish off the description, which you're
now stuck with until next time you change it. In addition to
@set_brief and @set_look, there's @set_glance and @set_examine. I
highly recommend their @help files.</p>

<p>Okay, so now you can give an object a basic description. Fair
enough. What else can you do with it? Well, you can move it around.
Go ahead and move it to wherever you're standing -- type "@move #2
here", which will teleport it to be inside whatever room you're
standing in. You can also teleport it somewhere else -- for
instance "@move #2 #0" will move it into The Void. You can teleport
there ("@goto #0") to make sure it arrived okay.</p>

<p>You can also add nouns and adjectives to it, but we'll cover
that in the section on <a href="Portables.html">portables</a>. If
you haven't had a look at the build help yet by typing "@help
builder" I highly recommend it.</p>

"../index.html">tutorials</a>.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Zones</h2>

<p>There's a pretty arcane set of commands in Phantasmal that
alluded to earlier. You don't need to use them at all most of the
time, but to be a good implementor on your Phantasmal-based MUD
you're going to need to figure them out. Well, that or hand-edit
the data files. But if you want to understand the commands, this
tutorial is here for ya, man.</p>

<p>That's right. Zones. Segments. And all those commands that play
with them. Pretty ugly and scary, huh? Let's hit the basic concepts
first, shall we?</p>

<p>Phantasmal divides all possible object numbers into groups of a
hundred. In theory the numbers go up to over two billion but most
MUDs shouldn't need to come anywhere near that. You can tell what
segment an object number is in by cutting off the last two digits.
For instance, object #374 is in segment 3. Object #3479234 is in
segment 34792 and on a very large or very fragmented MUD. Object
#2147 is in segment 21. No problem.</p>

<p>You can see what segments are sitting around by type @segmap.
The output might look like this:</p>
<pre>
Segments:
0      /usr/common/sys/mapd           0
1      /usr/common/sys/exitd          0
2      /usr/common/sys/mapd           0
3      /usr/common/sys/mapd           1
4      /usr/common/sys/mapd           1
5      /usr/common/sys/mobiled        0
--------
    
</pre>

<p>The numbers on the left are the segment numbers, the filename in
the middle is the segment owner, and the number on the right tells
you what zone number that segment is in. Every segment is in one
zone or another, though the zone might be zero, which means it's
not in any interesting zone at all.</p>

<p>So what's in any specific zone? To find out a little, type
@zonemap by itself on the command line. Your output might look like
this:</p>
<pre>
Zones:
  0: Unzoned
  1: Miskatonic University
  2: Innsmouth
-----
    
</pre>

<p>If so, then zone #1 is Miskatonic University and zone #2 is
Innsmouth. This zonemap probably belongs to a very small
Lovecraft-themed MUD.</p>

<p>Looking at the @segmap above, we see that zone #1 consists of
segments #3 and #4, or objects #300-#499, inclusive. To find out
what's there, you can type "@list_room world" if you're patient and
page through 'til you get to the zone you care about. Or you can
type "@stat #300" -- if there's a room number 300, you can then say
"@goto #300" to get there. If there isn't, you can make a room #300
(with @make_room or "@new_room #300") and then go there. Either
way, once you're in a room in that zone, one with an object number
between #300 and #499, you can just type "@list_room" and get a
list of just the objects in that zone.</p>

<p>What if you want to make a new zone, one nobody's ever dealt
with before? You can use the @new_zone command to make it if you
like. You'll first need to decide on a zone name. To call it Bob's
Big Basement, you'd say "@new_zone Bob's Big Basement". Type
@zonemap to make sure you did it right. Now type %datadump, because
you really don't want to create a bunch of stuff and then maybe
lose it. Save, save, save. Incidentally, I'm going to pretend for
the rest of this example that Bob's Big Basement was zone #4. If it
came out as a different one (check @zonemap to find out) then use
that number instead.</p>

<p>Now you want to put something into your new zone. How? First,
decide what segments you want it to occupy. In this case, you want
all new segments. There wasn't any owner for segment 6, so first of
all you can claim segment 6 -- object #600 through #699, for those
of you keeping count.</p>

<p>To do that, first create a new object #600. You can use
@make_room, @make_portable, @new_room, @new_portable, or probably
other commands as well. No matter how you do it, make an object
#600. Do it. Note that it has to be a room, portable or detail --
not an exit or a mobile, for instance.</p>

<p>That means there's now a segment 6. Type @segmap and you'll
probably notice that it's in zone 0, and thus unzoned. To change
that, you'll use a new nifty command you haven't seen before. Go
ahead and type "@set_seg_zone #6 #4". That should assign segment #6
to zone #4 (Bob's Big Basement). Now you've got a new zone, and
it's got its own segment. Do you utterly win or what?</p>

<p>At the moment segments are just a good way to organize object
numbers so everybody's stuff doesn't get all mixed up together. In
the future there'll be a way to set security on zones so that only
specific builders can mess with a given zone, thus keeping other
people out of your stuff.</p>

<p>You'll notice that mobiles and exits just allocate numbers any
way they please rather than paying proper attention to zones. While
some of that will eventually change, overall mobiles and exits are
both harder to corral into specific zones than objects are. We'll
figure more of this out when we've got permissions, we promise. For
the moment just create exits and mobiles as though zones didn't
exist and you'll find that everything works just fine.</p>

<p>What next? More <a href="../index.html">tutorials</a>, right? It
beats looking through the online help over and over and over, and
we <i>know</i> you have no social life, you MUD programmer,
you.</p>

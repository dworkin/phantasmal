<h1 style="text-align: center">Using Phrases in Phantasmal</h1>

<p>Phantasmal uses structures called 'Phrases' to handle most
output to the user. Phrases are a bit like strings in other MUDs,
but they do a number of other things for you as well. However, they
can require careful handling.</p>

<p>The first and simplest thing to remember about a Phrase is that
it is not really a string. You may use it in the same places you'd
expect to use a string, but it's not the same thing. That's because
Phantasmal holds itself to a higher standard on some things, and
that means it winds up holding <i>you</i> to a higher standard on
some of them. There are ways that your MUD isn't going to be
allowed to suck, whether you're willing to let it or not :-)</p>

<p>A Phrase can be thought of as being a string in a MUD markup
language. A markup language like HTML contains text, but it also
contains tags that mean various things about the text. You can have
simple markup tags for what color something is supposed to be or
whether it's supposed to be in italics. You can have more
interesting <i>semantic</i> markup &mdash; that is, markup about
the <i>meaning</i> of the text, not how it gets drawn &mdash; to
mark a particular piece of text as being an attack, or an exit, or
in Spanish or Dwarvish.</p>

<p>Phantasmal can use any of several different markup languages.
One markup language is similar to HTML or XML, in the same way that
some web sites use simplified HTML for comments. However, the
Phrase converts this markup into a binary internal format for
speed. So to edit a Phrase as markup, you'll need to export it as
ASCII using a function like to_xml(). You can then edit it as
markup and set the Phrase to a new value with from_xml(). Be sure
to preserve tags, and to tag your text appropriately!</p>

<p>One unusual thing about Phantasmal markup is the language tags.
Sometimes, the outermost tags of a Phrase will be "enUS", "esES" or
similar location tags. Note that this format for language names
refers to the language and then the country, so "enUS" refers to
the English language as spoken in the United States of America,
while "enUK" would be English in the United Kingdom. (Note: how
will a set of alternative language versions of the same piece of
text work? If we mark those, we can have less-favorite languages
easily)</p>

<p>For instance, a fine piece of XML markup might be
"&lt;enUS&gt;The goblin leaves
&lt;green&gt;west&lt;/green&gt;.&lt;/enUS&gt; &lt;esUS&gt;El goblin
sale &lt;verde&gt;oeste&lt;/verde&gt;.&lt;/esUS&gt;" Note the two
different language choices as the outermost tags, at the same level
as each other.</p>

<p>HTML has certain tags that don't have matching end-tags. For
instance, the &lt;hr&gt; tag. When doing fully-balanced HTML such
as strict xHTML, this is written &lt;hr /&gt; to indicate to the
parser that no matching end-tag is expected. This form is strongly
preferred in Phantasmal as well, though we'll try to put up with
whatever we can.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Markup Formats</h3>

<p>In addition to the XML markup format above, there is an UNQ
markup format. The UNQ format uses tags with the same names, but
the start and end markers are changed to a single label and then
curly braces surrounding the appropriate text. An UNQ tag which
stands alone just has an empty pair of curly braces after it.</p>

<p>So, for instance the equivalent of the above would be "~enUS{The
goblin leaves ~green{west}} ~esUS{El goblin sale
~verde{oeste}}".</p>

<p>Phrases may also be able to return UNQ data markup, which is the
equivalent of running the above UNQ through the UNQ parser.
However, it will usually be possible to generate UNQ data more
quickly by doing it directly than by generating the UNQ string and
then parsing.</p>

<p>There is also a format called 'taglist' format, used by
programs, that doesn't have a direct text representation. A taglist
is an array of even length which alternates between tag, text, tag,
text, et cetera. If there's no tag around the opening text, the
first element of the list is an empty string. Instead of having
nested tagged text like the UNQ markup, the taglist is a single
flat list. Tag names start with an opening or closing curly brace
to indicate whether they're opening or closing a tag's scope, or an
asterisk to indicate that the tag is freestanding and doesn't
enclose any other list items.</p>

<p>The taglist equivalent of the UNQ markup
"~enUS{~monster{~green{The goblin}} hits the ~target{}!}" would be
the DGD array ({ "{enUS", "", "{monster", "", "{green", "The
goblin", "}green", "", "}monster", "hits the", "*target", "!",
"}enUS", "" }).</p>

<p>Tags in a taglist should always be perfectly nested. So it would
be illegal to have a taglist like ({ "{green", "bob", "{red",
"sam", "}green", "", "}red", "" }). It is also illegal to have an
opening tag without a corresponding closing tag.</p>

<h2>Markup Tags</h2>

<p>These are currently tentative &mdash; we may well change them.
They're designed to work with the appropriate various
we-hope-to-support terminal types. That would include MXP, MSP,
MCP, IMP (FireClient), Pueblo, XMLTerm, VT100. They don't span the
full capabilities of all those terminals, but are meant to
translate tolerably into all of them.</p>

<p>The tags may be translated differently into different languages,
like the "verde" tag in the example markup above, eventually. I'll
need somebody to care more about that than I currently do... HTML
doesn't seem to do that, which is one reason I'm not yet
bothering.</p>

<h3>Display Markup</h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Design Notes for Phantasmal's Object
Manager</h2>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>

<p>Don't compile a library that isn't used by anything before the
ObjectD gets compiled. If you do, then when you rebuild that
library (say, during a full rebuild), you'll get a log message
saying that an unregistered issue of the lib is being removed. This
is an artifact of the way Phantasmal's ObjectD does object
discovery during its initialiation.</p>

<h3>Major data</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>obj_issues</dt>

  <dd>This is a HEAVY_ARRAY of issue numbers for each clonable and
  library.</dd>

  <dt>dest_issues</dt>

  <dd>The is a mapping, keyed by object name, of objects whose most
  recent issue has been destructed.</dd>

  <dt>fixups</dt>

  <dd>This mapping exists only during initialization. It is created
  by the recompile_to_track_libs function from recomp_paths. It
  maps from a library to the set of child objects that the library
  inherits.</dd>

  <dt>recomp_paths</dt>

  <dd>This mapping is useful only during initialization. It is
  keyed by object name, and the value is a list of what objects the
  key object is inherited by. It is set indirectly by
  compile_object and compile_lib, so it is indirectly set by
  recompiling all objects during init.</dd>

  <dt>all_libs</dt>

  <dd>This is a mapping of library names to their most current
  issue numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Major Functions</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>recompile_to_track_libs</dt>

  <dd>Builds the fixups array from recomp_paths, while destructing
  and recompiling every library in recomp_paths.</dd>

  <dt>fix_parent_arrays</dt>

  <dd>For each library L in fixups, for each child C to fix it for,
  replace L's program name with L's issue number in C's parent
  array.</dd>

  <dt>fix_child_arrays</dt>

  <dd>For every library, clear the previous issue number and the
  list of children. For every library, register_inherit_data(). For
  every object in ObjRegD (plus TELNET_CONN and BINARY_CONN), call
  register_inherit_data() on its issue.</dd>

  <dt>recompile_every_clonable</dt>

  <dd>For each object in ObjRegD plus TELNET_CONN and BINARY_CONN,
  recompile every non-clone object.</dd>

  <dt>recompile_every_object</dt>

  <dd>First, recompile_every_clonable(). Then
  recompile_to_track_libs(), fix_parent_arrays(), and
  fix_child_arrays(). This is most of the init sequence.</dd>

  <dt>count_clones</dt>

  <dd>Go through ObjRegD, adding clones to their appropriate issue
  structures.</dd>

  <dt>unregister_inherit_data(object issue)</dt>

  <dd>Remove this issue from its children's "parent" lists.</dd>

  <dt>register_inherit_data(object issue)</dt>

  <dd>Add this issue to its children's "parent" lists.</dd>

  <dt>clear_child_data(object issue)</dt>

  <dd>Remove this issue from its parents' "child" lists.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Initialization call sequence</h3>

<ul>
  <li>recompile_every_object:

    <ul>
      <li>recompile_every_clonable</li>

      <li>recompile_to_track_libs</li>

      <li>fix_parent_arrays</li>

      <li>fix_child_arrays</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>count_clones</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that when an object is recompiled, add_clonable or
add_lib is called. Either will call convert_inherited_str_to_mixed,
which will add any tracked libraries the object inherits to
all_libs. The function will also add appropriate dependencies to
recomp_paths if called during init.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Making New Help Entries</h3>

<p>Help entries are made using UNQ files. Each UNQ file contains a
number of individual entries. There are a couple of interesting
subtleties to creating entries. Let's look at one, shall we?</p>
<pre>
~name{~enUS{%write_log,%log, %log_write,%writelog}}
~keywords{admin}
~desc{
  ~enUS{

The @log (called %log and @write_log also, among others) command takes
a single string argument, much like "say".  However, it will log that
string along with your name to the system log.  In general, this is a
very poor way to send the equivalent of e-mail except on the most
excellently-run MUDs since most of the time the log gets briefly read
through (or not) and tossed out to make room for the next one.

}}
    
</pre>

<p>The "name" field tells the Help system what queries to return
this entry for. We'll get to that soon. The "keywords" field gives
a list of keywords -- the query supplies a corresponding list, and
only a query with the keywords in the help entry will return this
entry. For instance, this entry has the "admin" keyword, so only
queries by admin characters will be returned.</p>

<p>The "desc" field is a standard UNQ Phrase structure. The one
shown here is English-only. The description is what you get when
you ask for help on an appropriate thing from the "name" field.</p>

<p>The "name" field here seems incomplete. If you asked for help on
"log" or "write log", you'd hope it would give you help as well. As
it turns out, it does.</p>

<p>The Help system ignores most non-alphanumeric characters, and it
treats <b>-</b> and <b>_</b> as being the same as spaces. That
means that <b>%write_log</b> is the same as <b>write_log</b> is the
same as <b>write log</b> is the same as <b>@#$write@#$-log@#$#</b>.
They're all different from <b>writelog</b>, which is the same as
<b>%writelog</b>, <b>write@log</b>, and
<b>@#$@#write#@#%log@#@#</b>.</p>

<p>Soon, words will work in any order. That means that <b>write log
data</b> would be the same as <b>data write log</b> would be the
same as <b>write_data-log</b> and
<b>@#$#@log@#%#%-@#$#@$write_-data@#$@</b>. So you see, the quite
brief set of names above actually matches a surprising number of
help queries, useful and otherwise.</p>

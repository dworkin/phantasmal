  <h3 style="text-align: center"> UNQ Files:  What Are They? </h3>

  <p>
    UNQ is a format for structured data storage.  It's a lot like XML,
    though it's got some advantages for our use that XML doesn't.
    Specifically, there are some features that XML has that makes it
    difficult to use and to parse.  <a
    href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> solves this problem by
    just not implementing most of the problem features in their XML
    parser.  Phantasmal solves it by using something other than XML.
    That something is called <a
    href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a>, which was
    invented by Tom Lokovic as the basis of a language called PLUNQ.
    We don't use PLUNQ in Phantasmal, but we <i>do</i> use UNQ.  Clear
    as mud?
  </p>

  <p>
    So what's different from XML?  Well, an XML/HTML fragment like
    <tt>What's &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, doc?</tt> would become
    <tt>What's ~i{up}, doc?</tt> in UNQ.  Note that a tagged fragment
    starts with a tilde, then what the tag is (also called the label
    &mdash; in this case, &quot;i&quot;), and then has the content in
    curly braces.
  </p>

    <p>
      Like HTML and XML, UNQ embeds nicely in itself.  So an HTML
      expression like <tt>&lt;body&gt; Content goes
      &lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</tt> would become
      <tt>~body{ Content goes ~b{here} }</tt> in UNQ.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike in HTML, you can just skip the label.  So, for instance,
      <tt>{{Fred}{25}}{{Ethel}{39}}</tt> is a perfectly good UNQ
      expression.  The equivalent XML would have a lot of empty tags
      (like, tags that had no name, written something like &lt;&gt;)
      and look awful.
    </p>

    <p>
      UNQ pays attention to whitespace, so <tt>~bob{spam}</tt> and
      <tt>~bob { spam }</tt> are quite different from each other.
      That's not to say that every application of UNQ will treat the
      two differently &mdash; for instance, Phantasmal help files
      don't.  But some UNQ files may treat the two as different.
      Beware.  Even newlines can be permitted, both in text and in
      labels.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what are the big differences from XML?  First off, UNQ has
      none of the extra little quoted things inside tags.  Non-tagged
      stuff translates fine.  But an HTML fragment like <tt>&lt;h3
      align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; My Title &lt;/h3&gt;</tt> doesn't
      translate at all.  There's no equivalent in UNQ to bits like the
      <tt>align=&quot;center&quot;</tt>.  UNQ does nothing like that
      (nor, if memory serves, does Skotos' XML).  Getting rid of that
      makes the files easier to read that HTML or XML, and makes it
      easier for the MUD to parse them.
    </p>

    <p>
      In HTML, there are characters like the less-than and
      greater-than signs that start tags.  If you want to put a
      special character in your HTML document, you need to write it as
      something like &amp;lt; or &amp;quot; or &amp;amp;.  What's the
      UNQ equivalent?  How do you write a curly-brace in UNQ, or a
      tilde?
    </p>

    <p>
      UNQ, like C and LPC, uses a method called backslash-escaping for
      this purpose.  To write a tilde, you put \~ (backslash, then
      tilde) into your UNQ file.  You put the backslash in front of
      any curly brace (open <i>or</i> closed), any tilde, and any
      backslash that you want to have appear literally in your
      document.  For instance, a valid piece of UNQ might be <tt>my
      data contains a \~</tt>.  You can't write <tt>my document
      contains a ~</tt> &mdash; it's not valid UNQ, because it looks
      like you tried to make an UNQ tag and then never got around to
      putting curly braces.

<h3 style="text-align: center">UNQ Files: What Are They?</h3>

<p>UNQ is a format for structured data storage. It's a lot like
XML, though it's got some advantages for our use that XML doesn't.
Specifically, there are some features that XML has that makes it
difficult to use and to parse. <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> solves this problem by just not
implementing most of the problem features in their XML parser.
Phantasmal solves it by using something other than XML. That
something is called <a href=
"http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a>, which was
invented by Tom Lokovic as the basis of a language called PLUNQ. We
don't use PLUNQ in Phantasmal, but we <i>do</i> use UNQ. Clear as
mud?</p>

<p>So what's different from XML? Well, an XML/HTML fragment like
<tt>What's &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;, doc?</tt> would become <tt>What's
~i{up}, doc?</tt> in UNQ. Note that a tagged fragment starts with a
tilde, then what the tag is (also called the label &mdash; in this
case, "i"), and then has the content in curly braces.</p>

<p>Like HTML and XML, UNQ embeds nicely in itself. So an HTML
expression like <tt>&lt;body&gt; Content goes
&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</tt> would become <tt>~body{
Content goes ~b{here} }</tt> in UNQ.</p>

<p>Unlike in HTML, you can just skip the label. So, for instance,
<tt>{{Fred}{25}}{{Ethel}{39}}</tt> is a perfectly good UNQ
expression. The equivalent XML would have a lot of empty tags
(like, tags that had no name, written something like &lt;&gt;) and
look awful.</p>

<p>UNQ pays attention to whitespace, so <tt>~bob{spam}</tt> and
<tt>~bob { spam }</tt> are quite different from each other. That's
not to say that every application of UNQ will treat the two
differently &mdash; for instance, Phantasmal help files don't. But
some UNQ files may treat the two as different. Beware. Even
newlines can be permitted, both in text and in labels.</p>

<p>So what are the big differences from XML? First off, UNQ has
none of the extra little quoted things inside tags. Non-tagged
stuff translates fine. But an HTML fragment like <tt>&lt;h3
align="center"&gt; My Title &lt;/h3&gt;</tt> doesn't translate at
all. There's no equivalent in UNQ to bits like the
<tt>align="center"</tt>. UNQ does nothing like that (nor, if memory
serves, does Skotos' XML). Getting rid of that makes the files
easier to read that HTML or XML, and makes it easier for the MUD to
parse them.</p>

<p>In HTML, there are characters like the less-than and
greater-than signs that start tags. If you want to put a special
character in your HTML document, you need to write it as something
like &amp;lt; or &amp;quot; or &amp;amp;. What's the UNQ
equivalent? How do you write a curly-brace in UNQ, or a tilde?</p>

<p>UNQ, like C and LPC, uses a method called backslash-escaping for
this purpose. To write a tilde, you put \~ (backslash, then tilde)
into your UNQ file. You put the backslash in front of any curly
brace (open <i>or</i> closed), any tilde, and any backslash that
you want to have appear literally in your document. For instance, a
valid piece of UNQ might be <tt>my data contains a \~</tt>. You
can't write <tt>my document contains a ~</tt> &mdash; it's not
valid UNQ, because it looks like you tried to make an UNQ tag and
then never got around to putting curly braces.</p>

  <h3 style="text-align: center"> Phantasmal's Current Features </h3>

  <p>
    Phantasmal is a standard library for game features like NPCs,
    rooms and details.  It's a good base to begin construction from,
    but not a full game by itself.  Everything in this document is
    specific to Phantasmal and&frasl;or Seas of Night.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal allows logins and talking, chatting on channels and
    emote.  There's a SoulD to handle social commands (like giggle,
    burp and so on).  It has SSH support for player logins.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are simple autonomous mobiles that can wander about, and
    enough hooks that it's possible to get them to respond to
    reasonable stimuli.  Getting them to act reasonably is still in
    development, but the infrastructure is there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Portables can be gotten, dropped and generally manipulated.  They
    work fine as containers.  See the tutorials for examples of online
    creation.  Objects save and load happily in any topology, stacked
    to any depth, and there are permanent bodies and inventory.
    Objects can have other objects as &quot;details&quot;, which allow
    you to examine an object or setting in many particulars.  All
    these objects have weight, volume and size, and capacities for
    same.  A full inheritance system lets these properties propagate
    automatically to child objects.  The usual basic MUD commands for
    playing with objects, containers and rooms are implemented.  There
    are Online Creation (OLC) commands which allow an administrator to
    create, modify and destroy the entire MUD world.  Objects use a
    set of object descriptions inspired by Skotos' series of Building
    Blocks <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a convenient online help system.  It reads directories
    recursively and registers online help files localized to any or
    all supported locales.  It does Soundex matching (only in English
    currently) for words without explicit help entries.  The help
    system is well populated and quite adequate to the needs of a
    starting MUD.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal is localized.  That means object and room descriptions
    use Phrase structures rather than simple strings so that any such
    description is automatically localizable to any supported
    language.  Note that unicode characters are not yet supported.
    Spanish is the only current suggested locale, and many messages
    still need to be localized.  It's a good test for the various
    systems nonetheless.  Wish I was a better translator!
  </p>

  <p>
    In case of problems the binary port is still configured for
    emergency administrator login, and all the old wiz commands work
    just like the <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">unmodified Kernel
    MUDLib</a>.  On the regular port most of them have a % on the
    front, so they have names like %grant, %compile and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a> files
    supply non-statedump structured data storage very similar to XML
    in many ways, including Document Type Definitions to simplify
    parsing.  Localized structures and help files are stored this way.
    The UNQ parsing system is doing well and supports backslash
    escaping but not (yet) markup.  UNQ Document Type Definitions
    (DTDs) are well supported and greatly aid parsing most of the
    objects that Phantasmal stores in files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal builds on the code of the DGD Kernel Library and
    borrows specific tricks and concepts from several other MUDLibs.
    This gives it a good, secure base which is reinforced by
    additional security code in the Phantasmal Game API.  Phantasmal
    uses a lot of Kernel Library features like inheritance, full
    rebuilding and handling file security by user directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Phantasmal has scripts, though it needs to integrate them into
    more of what it does.  It has tags, which are arbitrary object
    properties necessary to make scripts useful.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's a simple object manager to handle in-place upgrades.  This
    is one of the requirements for a persistent MUD.  The ObjectD uses
    DGD's lightweight objects (LWOs) to keep its footprint reasonable,
    and manages them heirarchically to permit future expansion to very
    large number of objects.  Its current form tracks objects but
    doesn't help with partial rebuilds, only whole-hog AUTO upgrades.
    Until Phantasmal gets significantly larger and&frasl;or slower
    that's unlikely to be a real problem.

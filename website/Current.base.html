<h3>The Details</h3>

<p>Phantasmal is a good base to begin construction from, but not a full
game by itself. Seas of Night is a test game to show off Phantasmal's
power as a library. Some listed features require Seas of Night or
another Phantasmal-based library.</p>

<p>Phantasmal has scripts, though it needs to integrate them into more
of what it does. It has tags, which are arbitrary object properties that
make scripts really interesting.</p>

<p>Objects use a set of object descriptions inspired by Skotos' series
of Building Blocks <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>. Details also work
similarly.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is built on the DGD Kernel Library. This gives it a good,
secure base. It also allows Phantasmal's secure scripts and
rebuild-in-place.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is localized. That means object and room descriptions use
Phrase structures rather than simple strings so that any such
description is automatically localizable to any supported language. Note
that unicode characters are not yet supported. Spanish is the only
current suggested locale, and many messages still need to be localized.
It's a good test for the various systems nonetheless. Wish I was a
better translator!</p>

<p>In case of problems the binary port is still configured for emergency
administrator login, and all the old wiz commands work just like the
<a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">unmodified Kernel MUDLib</a>. On the
regular port most of them have a % on the front, so they have names like
%grant, %compile and so on.</p>

<p><a href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a> files supply
non-statedump structured data storage very similar to XML in many ways,
including Document Type Definitions to simplify parsing. Localized
structures and help files are stored this way. The UNQ parsing system is
doing well and supports backslash escaping and markup. UNQ Document Type
Definitions (DTDs) are well supported and greatly aid parsing most of
the objects that Phantasmal stores in files.</p>

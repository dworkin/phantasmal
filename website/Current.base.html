<h3>The Details</h3>

<p>Phantasmal is a good base to begin construction from, but not a
full game by itself. Seas of Night is a test game to show off
Phantasmal's power as a library. Some listed features require Seas
of Night or another Phantasmal-based library.</p>

<p>Phantasmal has scripts, though it needs to integrate them into
more of what it does. It has tags, which are arbitrary object
properties that make scripts really interesting.</p>

<p>Objects use a set of object descriptions inspired by Skotos'
series of Building Blocks <a href=
"http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>. Details also work
similarly.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is built on the DGD Kernel Library. This gives it a
good, secure base. It also allows Phantasmal's secure scripts and
rebuild-in-place.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is localized. That means object and room descriptions
use Phrase structures rather than simple strings so that any such
description is automatically localizable to any supported language.
Note that unicode characters are not yet supported. Spanish is the
only current suggested locale, and many messages still need to be
localized. It's a good test for the various systems nonetheless.
Wish I was a better translator!</p>

<p>In case of problems the binary port is still configured for
emergency administrator login, and all the old wiz commands work
just like the <a href="DGD/Kernel/Commands.html">unmodified Kernel
MUDLib</a>. On the regular port most of them have a % on the front,
so they have names like %grant, %compile and so on.</p>

<p><a href="http://plunq.sourceforge.net/name.html">UNQ</a> files
supply non-statedump structured data storage very similar to XML in
many ways, including Document Type Definitions to simplify parsing.
Localized structures and help files are stored this way. The UNQ
parsing system is doing well and supports backslash escaping and
markup. UNQ Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are well supported and
greatly aid parsing most of the objects that Phantasmal stores in
files.</p>

<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> Phantasmal is no longer under active development.
While I cheerfully answer questions about it on the DGD mailing list,
little or no new development is likely for some time. This site is still
useful if you want to learn from Phantasmal, and you're more than
welcome to take chunks of code from it wholesale. That's why it's in the
public domain!</p>

<h3>Setting Up Your MUD</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="Installing.html">How do I get Phantasmal
  installed?</a></li>

  <li>To get started with Phantasmal, <a href=
  "Tutorial/index.html">check out our tutorials!</a> They cover basic
  administration and how to build rooms, items, mobiles and so on.</li>

  <li>Please read <a href="Setup/index.html">"How to set up a new
  Phantasmal-based MUD"</a>. This will get you started adding your own
  new code and features to your MUD.</li>

  <li>You may want the <a href="API/index.html">Phantasmal function
  API</a> for building a Phantasmal-based game. It's not as up-to-date
  as most of the documentation, but it's still frequently better than
  just reading the source code.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Test servers</h3>

<p><i>(coming soon...)</i></p>

<p>To actively test Phantasmal, Shentino will be running 3 test muds on
necronomicorp.com.  Please see <a href="Test">here</a> for more
information.</p>

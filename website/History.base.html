<h2>A Brief History of Phantasmal</h2>

<p>I've done a number of MUD projects before Phantasmal, and a great
many TCP/IP servers in C. I had switched to a C/Perl hybrid and was
trying to figure out how to safely interrupt Perl code after it had
overrun its processor allotment and gotten itself all tangled up. I
could control its operations, functions and memory usage with the
excellent Sandbox module, but the processor thing was eluding me. I'd
worked out a solution involving an external Perl process which could be
fully killed and restarted if anything went badly wrong, but I had no
way to limit the maximum latency...</p>

<p>And then, during a random web search, it hit me. DGD. A server that
already <i>did</i> everything I wanted. It looked good. The feature list
was beautiful. The additional stuff it did like recompile-in-place and
atomic functions was awe-inspiring. It was very actively maintained. It
had an intelligent author and the code was lean, svelte and secure.</p>

<p>On June 18th, I started building an experimental DGD-based MUD to
replace my all-custom C-and-perl hybrid MUD (called "Black Oyster"). It
was my first work on DGD.</p>

<p>I dug deeper into DGD. There wasn't much documentation. "Read the
mailing list" was pretty much what it boiled down to. I did. Then I
arranged salient bits into an early prototype web site. And I kept
building.</p>

<p>After awhile, I realized that not only was there no good MUDLib,
people had been asking for one for <i>years</i>, and nobody was
seriously working on one. So I cobbled some stuff together, built a new
public domain ObjectD, released it, and added a simple MUDLib on top.
Thus, on February 8, 2002 was Phantasmal 0.001 released. I follow Linus
Torvalds' lead on object numbers -- start very, very small, with the
assumption that you can always have a version 1.0 when it's bug-free
:-)</p>

<p>Early on, it lived in my personal BitKeeper repository and I'd
periodically make releases FTPable from my personal machine. I didn't
bother to keep statistics, and I don't know if anybody bothered to
download the early releases. It was more learning code for folks on the
DGD mailing list, and that was plenty for me.</p>

<p>On March 12th, about a month later, I put it up on SourceForge.
Development had been pretty wild at the beginning and Phantasmal version
0.001 through 0.005 were all before I moved to SourceForge. You can find
them there now, but the listed downloads are all people that downloaded
them as a historical curiosity or because some later release didn't work
:-)</p>

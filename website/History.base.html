<h2>A Brief History of Phantasmal</h2>

<p>I've done a number of MUD projects before Phantasmal, and a
great many TCP/IP servers in C. I had switched to a C/Perl hybrid
and was trying to figure out how to safely interrupt Perl code
after it had overrun its processor allotment and gotten itself all
tangled up. I could control its operations, functions and memory
usage with the excellent Sandbox module, but the processor thing
was eluding me. I'd worked out a solution involving an external
Perl process which could be fully killed and restarted if anything
went badly wrong, but I had no way to limit the maximum
latency...</p>

<p>And then, during a random web search, it hit me. DGD. A server
that already <i>did</i> everything I wanted. It looked good. The
feature list was beautiful. The additional stuff it did like
recompile-in-place and atomic functions was awe-inspiring. It was
very actively maintained. It had an intelligent author and the code
was lean, svelte and secure.</p>

<p>On June 18th, I started building an experimental DGD-based MUD
to replace my all-custom C-and-perl hybrid MUD (called "Black
Oyster"). It was my first work on DGD.</p>

<p>I dug deeper into DGD. There wasn't much documentation. "Read
the mailing list" was pretty much what it boiled down to. I did.
Then I arranged salient bits into an early prototype web site. And
I kept building.</p>

<p>After awhile, I realized that not only was there no good MUDLib,
people had been asking for one for <i>years</i>, and nobody was
seriously working on one. So I cobbled some stuff together, built a
new public domain ObjectD, released it, and added a simple MUDLib
on top. Thus, on February 8, 2002 was Phantasmal 0.001 released. I
follow Linus Torvalds' lead on object numbers -- start very, very
small, with the assumption that you can always have a version 1.0
when it's bug-free :-)</p>

<p>Early on, it lived in my personal BitKeeper repository and I'd
periodically make releases FTPable from my personal machine. I
didn't bother to keep statistics, and I don't know if anybody
bothered to download the early releases. It was more learning code
for folks on the DGD mailing list, and that was plenty for me.</p>

<p>On March 12th, about a month later, I put it up on SourceForge.
Development had been pretty wild at the beginning and Phantasmal
version 0.001 through 0.005 were all before I moved to SourceForge.
You can find them there now, but the listed downloads are all
people that downloaded them as a historical curiosity or because
some later release didn't work :-)</p>

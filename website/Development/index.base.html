<h1>Development on Phantasmal</h1>

<p>Naturally, this being a sourceforge project, we welcome
developers. This section will tell you how to join, how to
contribute, and what coding standards we use.</p>

<p><i>Temporary notice: Phantasmal development is frozen. Shentino
is taking inventory of his shiny new project, and unless he hears
otherwise from one of the existing developers, all development is
on hold while he sets up the website. The sources are likely to be
in solo flux.</i></p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Maybe you're helping to add features to Phantasmal. Maybe you're
developing your own MUDLib and you're starting from Phantasmal.
Both work pretty much exactly the same way, and either way this
document has some tips for you.</p>

<p>First off, you <i>need</i> to read the documentation. I'm aware
there's a lot of it out there, at least compared to similar Open
Source projects. I consider that a good thing. This web site (
<a href=
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net">http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net</a>),
the DGD-specific sister site ( <a href=
"http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD">http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/DGD</a>
), those are obvious. Also, read the documentation directory within
Phantasmal itself. You'll find it in /doc/design and /doc/api. It's
often out-of-date, but it documents several things that are simply
not mentioned anywhere else. Feel free to submit improvements and
updates to it, you're helping the larger community by doing so.</p>

<p>The SETUP text file in Phantasmal's root directory contains a
bit about its overall architecture, and you'll get a bit in README
and INSTALL as well. Make sure to look through them. These files
are prominently placed. That's because Phantasmal aims at
developers rather than "end-users" who will use the MUD as
supplied. We don't want a lot of stock MUDLibs, so try to be
creative :-)</p>

<p>The final sources of documentation are the community itself.
Look to the DGD mailing list and the Phantasmal Sourceforge forums.
I try to fold the information from the list and forums into the web
site, but I'm only human. Nothing beats the original source for
detail and elaboration. And speaking of "the original source",
remember that the DGD community is still small. That means there
are limits to what you can find within it, but it also means that
anybody you can find is happy to answer questions. I love to do so
(I can steal my answers back and put them on the web site). Steve
Schmidt the Melville author (aka mobydick), is also quite pleasant
and polite. He's still active on the DGD mailing list. If you've
got a question related to Phantasmal or Melville, you'll find the
DGD Mailing List is an appreciative forum.</p>

<p>In the extended DGD community is Skotos -- they keep Dworkin fed
by paying him money. They keep DGD humming along and they
occasionally contribute to the mailing list. They frequently write
new <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles">articles</a>. You can
find a little "Phantasmal's Best Of" for those articles <a href=
"../Innsmouth/Articles.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The Source Tree</h3>

<p>After you've read the documentation, it's time to grab some
sources and play with them. Before you start developing a MUDLib or
DGD itself, make sure you can use the regular code-drops. That
means making an experimental version of DGD from 1.2.50 and a bunch
of patches. Then grab the latest release of Phantasmal from
SourceForge. There's a lot of documentation on how to do that on
the DGD site and in the INSTALL text file in Phantasmal.
Alternately, skip all that and grab the bundled version, but it's
harder to do SourceForge development for Phantasmal that way.</p>

<p>There's a choice you're going to have to make if you're
developing your own MUDLib -- will you keep up with mainstream
Phantasmal, or will you branch off at some point and do stuff on
your own? Phantasmal is in the public domain so you can legally do
either, or you can do a hybrid of both. If you're keeping up with
Phantasmal or taking a hybrid approach then you'll need to keep a
Phantasmal source tree around. Then you can keep it up to date with
regular diffs and patching. Features that you want to keep, you can
fold right in. Anything that conflicts with your own work, you'll
need to adapt or discard.</p>

<p>(to be updated, we use Subversion now)</p>

<p>So get the latest CVS version of Phantasmal and keep it
well-updated. Once you've set up the repository, make sure to run
"cvs update -Pd" regularly. Those options will prune away empty
directories, which is usually a good thing, but can occasionally be
irritating.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other things that may be useful for your
project. To see my recommendations for development, check out the
document for <a href="Sourceforge.html">SourceForge Phantasmal
Development</a>.</p>

<p>This last bit is just a matter of courtesy, but I'd love to know
how you're doing with Phantasmal. Let me know what parts you like,
what parts you hate, and where you think I was obviously smoking
something illegal with my head up various of my orifices. If you
have problems that you think might be caused by what I wrote
instead of what you wrote, or especially problems you fix, let me
know about it. I'll put you on the Credits page if you ask, or if I
happen to think about it :-)</p>

<p>And bear in mind -- more than anything else, development is
<a href="http://www.sinfest.net/comics/sf20030303.gif">a state of
mind</a>.</p>

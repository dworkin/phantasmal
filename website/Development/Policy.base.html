<h2>Development Policies</h2>

<h3>Contributor Agreement</h3>

<p>1.  Anyone who contributes code to the Phantasmal Project, directly
or otherwise, shall be known as a "Contributor" in this document.  The
code so contributed shall be known as "Code".  The Phantasmal project
shall be known as "Project".</p>

<p>2.  Contributor agrees to license said Code to the Project under the
terms of the license granted by the <a href="Copyright.html">Phantasmal
copyright</a>.</p>

<p>3.  Contributor expressly warrants that Contributor is authorized to
contribute said Code to project under the terms of the aforementioned
license, and acknowledges that he or she has a "duty of care" to the
Project and its developers and admins not to cause the Project to
infringe upon either copyright or patent by contributing said Code. 

<p>4.  Contributor further agrees that breach of this duty shall
constitute negligence under civil tort law, and accordingly, that in the
event of such a breach, the Contributor shall be responsible for curing
any and all damages proximally caused by said breach.</p>

<p>In plain English, what this means is that if you give us code, you
give us a license to use it freely under the same terms that apply to
Phantasmal for the general public, and that you are promising us that
the code you give is legit and legal, and that if it isn't, you're going
to be responsible for any flak we get as a result.</p>

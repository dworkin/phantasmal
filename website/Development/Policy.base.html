<h2>Development Policies</h2>

<p>The following policies are just legal arse-covering to protect
us from shenanigans and nincompoopery. We actually plan on being a
fairly open community.</p>

<h3>Contributor Agreement</h3>

<p>1. Anyone who contributes code or other material to the
Phantasmal Project, directly or otherwise, shall be known as a
"Contributor" in this document. The material so contributed shall
be known as "Code". The Phantasmal project, and its collective
members, shall be known as "Project".</p>

<p>2. Contributor agrees to license said Code to the Project under
the terms of the license granted by the <a href=
"Copyright.html">Phantasmal copyright</a>.</p>

<p>3. Contributor expressly warrants that Contributor is authorized
to contribute said Code to Project under the terms of the
aforementioned license and that said Code is not submitted in
violation of any applicable copyrights, patents, trademarks, or
agreements of any kind whatsoever.</p>

<p>4. In the event of a breach of the above warranty, Contributor
agrees to cure to the best of their ability said breach, and
furthermore agrees to indemnify the Project and any members thereof
for any losses caused by said breach, including but not limited to
judgments, attorney's fees, or any other expense incurred in
defending the Project from any lawsuit brought by an entity whose
intellectual property rights are found to be infringed by said Code
being contributed to the Project.</p>

<p>5. Contributor agrees that violation of these policies shall
constitute grounds for expulsion from the Project.</p>

<p>6. By contributing Code to the Project, Contributor indicates
acceptance of these terms.</p>

<p>In plain English, what this means is that if you give us code,
you give us a license to use it freely under the same terms that
apply to Phantasmal for the general public, that you are promising
us that the code you give is legit and legal, and that if it isn't,
you're going to be responsible for dealing with the consequences,
and any penalties we suffer as a result will come out of your
pocket.</p>

<p>For the most part, just use common sense and you'll be OK.</p>

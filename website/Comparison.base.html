<h2>How does Phantasmal compare to other MUDLibs?</h2>

<p>That's a fair question. Naturally this page is quite biased, and more
information should be sought before you're fully satisfied. The DGD
mailing list is an excellent resource for this kind of question and I
recommend it over my own personal opinion as author of Phantasmal
:-)</p>

<p>For DGD, my current opinion is that the competition is between
Melville and Phantasmal if you're building most of the game, and between
2.4.5 and GurbaLib if you need something that's pretty much already a
MUD.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to Melville?</h3>

<p>Melville and Phantasmal both provide player logins, objects, rooms,
soulDs and basic descriptions. They both provide basic chat facilities,
including a ChannelD.</p>

<p>Melville also provides in-MUD mail and bulletin boards where you can
post and read messages. Its most compelling feature for most users,
though, is the fact that its code is quite simple. Melville doesn't do
much extra for you, but its functionality is straightforward, and its
structure reflects that. Developers have been using it as a very good
tutorial for a very long time -- it's one of the oldest DGD MUDLibs.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is designed for more expansion. It has a robust and
well-populated help system, extensive OLC (online creation) facilities,
several well-defined file formats for loading objects, extensive
localization, and the ability to recompile the MUD on the fly. It has
mobiles, and daemons managing its various objects. It's also based on
the Kernel MUDLib, giving it a very stable and secure base to work from.
Recent versions contain many more features than Melville, despite a few
specific Melville features that they don't have.</p>

<p>Looking at a feature comparison, it's all over but the shouting. It
remains to be seen, though, if developers will begin actually creating
MUDs based on Phantasmal... Melville's compelling simplicity continues
to win it converts, and Phantasmal is sufficiently different from other
MUDs to be intimidating to new administrators. For the moment, neither
of them are the basis of any known successful MUDs, though a few of
Phantasmal's components have been used in Jay Shaffstall's excellent
'Electric Sheep' MUD.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to the Kernel MUDLib?</h3>

<p>Phantasmal is built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and provides
services on top of it. The Kernel MUDLib inheritance and security
services are provided nearly unaltered. The Kernel MUDLib is
significantly worse than Phantasmal for providing a stereotypical MUD,
but it's also cleaner, slightly more secure and more tightly written. It
isn't possible to change at Phantasmal's rate and still maintain the
extremely high code standards of the Kernel Library, but Phantasmal does
a decent job on all these counts.</p>

<p>If you want to build on the Kernel MUDLib, Phantasmal makes a fine
example of how to do so. You could also take Phantasmal components to
use in your own library. Both Phantasmal and the Kernel MUDLib are
public domain, so either one can be used or relicensed in any way
whatsoever.</p>

<p>Much as the Kernel Library provides a base to build a MUDLib on,
Phantasmal provides a base to build a MUD on. Some objects, like the
User object, even have mostly the same interface in Phantasmal as in the
Kernel Library. The Kernel Library provides services like inheritance,
security and events to a MUDLib, while Phantasmal provides services like
rooms, mobiles, containers, recurrent events and basic activities to a
MUD. They're powerful in combination, but the Kernel Library can also be
used separately.</p>

Library, check out <a href="DGD/Kernel">this section</a> of my main DGD
site.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to GurbaLib?</h3>

<p>GurbaLib has a large set of game features that Phantasmal does not
have. They're not always polished and perfect, but they exist. Many
features (guilds, classes) will never be provided by Phantasmal proper,
but may be provided by games on top of Phantasmal. Some features, such
as IMUD3 support, can't be implemented on top of vanilla DGD so
Phantasmal will never have them. Features implemented by GurbaLib but
not Phantasmal include: wearable and wieldable objects; FTP Daemon and
IMUD3 support; Actions and Triggers; Message Boards; Races; Player and
Site Banning; Vendors; Guilds; Aliases; Skill System.</p>

<p>Obviously, GurbaLib as described is more suitable for a stereotypical
MUD than Phantasmal is. Phantasmal <i>does</i> have areas in which it
can claim superiority. Phantasmal can rebuild in-place, and has a
genuinely excellent help system. Its localization is extensive and
GurbaLib's is nonexistent. Phantasmal has a good security model and a
well thought-out design, both areas where Gurba does more poorly.
However, for stereotypical MUD use Phantasmal simply isn't up to Gurba's
feature list.</p>

<p>GurbaLib isn't based on the Kernel MUDLib, and runs on a modified DGD
1.1. This makes it problematic to follow current experimental DGD
development. That may not be a problem for you if you don't want LWOs,
atomicity, and other features from the last few years of DGD
development.</p>

<p>As a standard out-of-box LPMUD, GurbaLib is probably the best
currently available. It isn't as flexible as Phantasmal, nor does it
show off many of DGD's features like rebuild-in-place, but it has a
decent game already built. It's a fine reason to never again consider
using 2.4.5.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to 2.4.5?</h3>

<p>The 2.4.5 MUDLib is ugly and nasty inside, it hasn't been updated to
newer DGD versions and it is very poorly suited to demonstrating DGD's
impressive functionality. Nonetheless it is surprisingly prevalent.
That's because it allows you to simply unpack-and-go to get a very basic
MUD set up, as no other available MUDLib does. Since it's already usable
as a game, it often wins over MUDLibs that have substantial start-up
effort. It's also because it's old, old, old, so a lot of MUDs used it
when there were no other choices.</p>

<p>2.4.5 isn't really comparable to Phantasmal. Most existing 2.4.5 MUDs
started using it because it was the only thing available (or the most
compatible with whatever non-DGD driver they ported from) and continued
using it because it's painful to switch codebases. Phantasmal will need
to exist another decade before it can hope to be such an entrenched
solution.</p>

<p>Currently 2.4.5 has wearable and wieldable items, combat, food and
drink, and other general gameplay elements over Phantasmal. Phantasmal
has localization, OLC, full recompilation and help system over 2.4.5.
Even when Phantasmal has extensive gameplay features, it still will not
replace 2.4.5's biggest advantage, the fact that 2.4.5 has been around
for a ridiculously long time and is the basis of many existing MUDs.</p>

<h3>What about non-DGD MUDLibs?</h3>

<p>You could look at the LDMUD server, but there don't seem to be any
overwhelmingly good MUDLibs. And if you're going to build your own
MUDLib from scratch anyway, why not use DGD? It's a better server than
LDMUD.</p>

<p>Everything on Amylaar is quite outdated. So for lack of other
LP-compatible drivers, I'd go for MudOS if you're looking at non-DGD
platforms.</p>

<p>Probably the best non-DGD competition is the Lima MUDLib for MudOS.
It's cleaner and structured better than TMI-2, and is more modern and
more powerful than Nightmare, LDMUD or Amylaar. Lima provides a better
example of a stereotype LPMUD than 2.4.5 or GurbaLib. It obviously
doesn't have some of DGD's features like atomic functions or statedumps,
but is overall a quite acceptable alternative in most respects. It's
probably the best choice if what you want is an LPMUD like the other
ones out there, but easier to maintain than 2.4.5.</p>

<p>Phantasmal doesn't currently compete seriously with Lima. Lima, like
Gurbalib, implements a powerful and extensive set of game rules.
Phantasmal does not. Phantasmal might more reasonably be seen as
competing with MudOS -- the combination of Phantasmal, the Kernel
Library and DGD are jointly similar in power and complexity to using
MudOS by itself.</p>

<h3>What About Skotos?</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Skotos has not yet released their open-source
offering, SkotOS 2.0. Until they do so, their library remains powerful
but exclusive, and it's difficult to get permission to build with it. No
significant documentation is publicly available.</p>

<p>When and if SkotOS 2.0 comes out, that may be a whole other kettle of
fish.</p>

<h3>Any Other DGD MUDLibs Out There?</h3>

<p>There are a few miscellaneous things like Inferno, and the adaptation
of LambdaMOO to DGD. They're in entirely different categories. They
don't have enough in common with anything mentioned here to really
compete with them.</p>

<p>There are several SourceForge MUDLibs in early development, and
probably more than aren't on SourceForge. None of them have released
much anything yet, but we can all wait eagerly to hear from them. Until
they've released code, it's hard to judge them.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://herator.lysator.liu.se/index_en.html">Herator</a>
MUD Library hasn't publicly published their code, though there are a few
interesting files that can be downloaded when their Subversion
repository is up. I don't know what their schedule is or how they plan
to publish. Their pages don't say. They seem to be using the LGPL
license for their library.</p>

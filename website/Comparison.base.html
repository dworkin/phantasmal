@@TITLE Comparison to Other Libs@@

<h2>How does Phantasmal compare to other MUDLibs?</h2>

<p>That's a fair question. Naturally this page is quite biased, and
more information should be sought before you're fully satisfied.
The DGD mailing list is an excellent resource for this kind of
question and I recommend it over my own personal opinion as author
of Phantasmal :-)</p>

<p>For DGD, my current opinion is that the competition is between
Melville and Phantasmal if you're building most of the game, and
between 2.4.5 and GurbaLib if you need something that's pretty much
already a MUD.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to Melville?</h3>

<p>Melville and Phantasmal both provide player logins, objects,
rooms, soulDs and basic descriptions. They both provide basic chat
facilities, including a ChannelD.</p>

<p>Melville also provides in-MUD mail and bulletin boards where you
can post and read messages. Its most compelling feature for most
users, though, is the fact that its code is quite simple. Melville
doesn't do much extra for you, but its functionality is
straightforward, and its structure reflects that. Developers have
been using it as a very good tutorial for a very long time -- it's
one of the oldest DGD MUDLibs.</p>

<p>Phantasmal is designed for more expansion. It has a robust and
well-populated help system, extensive OLC (online creation)
facilities, several well-defined file formats for loading objects,
extensive localization, and the ability to recompile the MUD on the
fly. It has mobiles, and daemons managing its various objects. It's
also based on the Kernel MUDLib, giving it a very stable and secure
base to work from. Recent versions contain many more features than
Melville, despite a few specific Melville features that they don't
have.</p>

<p>Looking at a feature comparison, it's all over but the shouting.
It remains to be seen, though, if developers will begin actually
creating MUDs based on Phantasmal... Melville's compelling
simplicity continues to win it converts, and Phantasmal is
sufficiently different from other MUDs to be intimidating to new
administrators. For the moment, neither of them are the basis of
any known successful MUDs, though a few of Phantasmal's components
have been used in Jay Shaffstall's excellent 'Electric Sheep'
MUD.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to the Kernel MUDLib?</h3>

<p>Phantasmal is built on top of the Kernel MUDLib, and provides
services on top of it. The Kernel MUDLib inheritance and security
services are provided nearly unaltered. The Kernel MUDLib is
significantly worse than Phantasmal for providing a stereotypical
MUD, but it's also cleaner, slightly more secure and more tightly
written. It isn't possible to change at Phantasmal's rate and still
maintain the extremely high code standards of the Kernel Library,
but Phantasmal does a decent job on all these counts.</p>

<p>If you want to build on the Kernel MUDLib, Phantasmal makes a
fine example of how to do so. You could also take Phantasmal
components to use in your own library. Both Phantasmal and the
Kernel MUDLib are public domain, so either one can be used or
relicensed in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>Much as the Kernel Library provides a base to build a MUDLib on,
Phantasmal provides a base to build a MUD on. Some objects, like
the User object, even have mostly the same interface in Phantasmal
as in the Kernel Library. The Kernel Library provides services like
inheritance, security and events to a MUDLib, while Phantasmal
provides services like rooms, mobiles, containers, recurrent events
and basic activities to a MUD. They're powerful in combination, but
the Kernel Library can also be used separately.</p>

Library, check out <a href="DGD/Kernel">this section</a> of my main
DGD site.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to GurbaLib?</h3>

<p>GurbaLib has a large set of game features that Phantasmal does
not have. They're not always polished and perfect, but they exist.
Many features (guilds, classes) will never be provided by
Phantasmal proper, but may be provided by games on top of
Phantasmal. Some features, such as IMUD3 support, can't be
implemented on top of vanilla DGD so Phantasmal will never have
them. Features implemented by GurbaLib but not Phantasmal include:
wearable and wieldable objects; FTP Daemon and IMUD3 support;
Actions and Triggers; Message Boards; Races; Player and Site
Banning; Vendors; Guilds; Aliases; Skill System.</p>

<p>Obviously, GurbaLib as described is more suitable for a
stereotypical MUD than Phantasmal is. Phantasmal <i>does</i> have
areas in which it can claim superiority. Phantasmal can rebuild
in-place, and has a genuinely excellent help system. Its
localization is extensive and GurbaLib's is nonexistent. Phantasmal
has a good security model and a well thought-out design, both areas
where Gurba does more poorly. However, for stereotypical MUD use
Phantasmal simply isn't up to Gurba's feature list.</p>

<p>GurbaLib isn't based on the Kernel MUDLib, and runs on a
modified DGD 1.1. This makes it problematic to follow current
experimental DGD development. That may not be a problem for you if
you don't want LWOs, atomicity, and other features from the last
few years of DGD development.</p>

<p>As a standard out-of-box LPMUD, GurbaLib is probably the best
currently available. It isn't as flexible as Phantasmal, nor does
it show off many of DGD's features like rebuild-in-place, but it
has a decent game already built. It's a fine reason to never again
consider using 2.4.5.</p>

<h3>How does Phantasmal compare to 2.4.5?</h3>

<p>The 2.4.5 MUDLib is ugly and nasty inside, it hasn't been
updated to newer DGD versions and it is very poorly suited to
demonstrating DGD's impressive functionality. Nonetheless it is
surprisingly prevalent. That's because it allows you to simply
unpack-and-go to get a very basic MUD set up, as no other available
MUDLib does. Since it's already usable as a game, it often wins
over MUDLibs that have substantial start-up effort. It's also
because it's old, old, old, so a lot of MUDs used it when there
were no other choices.</p>

<p>2.4.5 isn't really comparable to Phantasmal. Most existing 2.4.5
MUDs started using it because it was the only thing available (or
the most compatible with whatever non-DGD driver they ported from)
and continued using it because it's painful to switch codebases.
Phantasmal will need to exist another decade before it can hope to
be such an entrenched solution.</p>

<p>Currently 2.4.5 has wearable and wieldable items, combat, food
and drink, and other general gameplay elements over Phantasmal.
Phantasmal has localization, OLC, full recompilation and help
system over 2.4.5. Even when Phantasmal has extensive gameplay
features, it still will not replace 2.4.5's biggest advantage, the
fact that 2.4.5 has been around for a ridiculously long time and is
the basis of many existing MUDs.</p>

<h3>What about non-DGD MUDLibs?</h3>

<p>You could look at the LDMUD server, but there don't seem to be
any overwhelmingly good MUDLibs. And if you're going to build your
own MUDLib from scratch anyway, why not use DGD? It's a better
server than LDMUD.</p>

<p>Everything on Amylaar is quite outdated. So for lack of other
LP-compatible drivers, I'd go for MudOS if you're looking at
non-DGD platforms.</p>

<p>Probably the best non-DGD competition is the Lima MUDLib for
MudOS. It's cleaner and structured better than TMI-2, and is more
modern and more powerful than Nightmare, LDMUD or Amylaar. Lima
provides a better example of a stereotype LPMUD than 2.4.5 or
GurbaLib. It obviously doesn't have some of DGD's features like
atomic functions or statedumps, but is overall a quite acceptable
alternative in most respects. It's probably the best choice if what
you want is an LPMUD like the other ones out there, but easier to
maintain than 2.4.5.</p>

<p>Phantasmal doesn't currently compete seriously with Lima. Lima,
like Gurbalib, implements a powerful and extensive set of game
rules. Phantasmal does not. Phantasmal might more reasonably be
seen as competing with MudOS -- the combination of Phantasmal, the
Kernel Library and DGD are jointly similar in power and complexity
to using MudOS by itself.</p>

<h3>What About Skotos?</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Skotos has not yet released their
open-source offering, SkotOS 2.0. Until they do so, their library
remains powerful but exclusive, and it's difficult to get
permission to build with it. No significant documentation is
publicly available.</p>

<p>When and if SkotOS 2.0 comes out, that may be a whole other
kettle of fish.</p>

<h3>Any Other DGD MUDLibs Out There?</h3>

<p>There are a few miscellaneous things like Inferno, and the
adaptation of LambdaMOO to DGD. They're in entirely different
categories. They don't have enough in common with anything
mentioned here to really compete with them.</p>

<p>There are several SourceForge MUDLibs in early development, and
probably more than aren't on SourceForge. None of them have
released much anything yet, but we can all wait eagerly to hear
from them. Until they've released code, it's hard to judge
them.</p>

<p>The <a href=
"http://herator.lysator.liu.se/index_en.html">Herator</a> MUD
Library hasn't publicly published their code, though there are a
few interesting files that can be downloaded when their Subversion
repository is up. I don't know what their schedule is or how they
plan to publish. Their pages don't say. They seem to be using the
LGPL license for their library.</p>

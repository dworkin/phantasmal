In response to a recent request, I, Noah Gibbs, am happy to relicense anything
I have written about, or in, DGD under the CC0 license.

This includes the Phantasmal MUD library and the bulk of the "website" directory, though much content of the web site was taken from the old DGD email list archive, from a variety of authors.

First, you'll need a working DGD installation, a working Kernel
Library installation, and a working Phantasmal installation.  The
Kernel Library should be set up automatically with DGD, though you may
want to test it first.  You can find stuff about Phantasmal and about
how to set up DGD at "http://www.sf.net/projects/phantasmal" and at
"http://phantasmal.sf.net/DGD".

Add necessary symlinks to the usr and kernel directories.  See README
files in those directories for details.

Change the testgame.dgd file to point to your correct absolute path.

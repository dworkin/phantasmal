               Phantasmal, the Bundled Release

You've downloaded and unpacked the bundled release of Phantasmal for
DGD.  Congratulations, you're well on your way to a life of
satisfaction and serenity.  Well, at least to running a MUD on a solid
and secure driver, free of segfaults.

To install, you'll need to run the install script in the top-level
directory.  It will customize the bundle for the directory you've
installed it in, and possibly other aspects of your system.  Go ahead
and read the INSTALL file in this directory for more details.


                         Port Numbers

Phantasmal uses the third binary port for standard login, or the only
telnet port.  Either of those should get you a satisfactory result if
you use them for telnetting to the MUD.  The first binary port is the
safety port - you don't want normal players using it.  The second
binary port is for SSH, and you'll want to instruct the players in how
to use that as a MUD client.


                           Versions

This bundled release incorporates a recent version of DGD, a recent version
of Phantasmal, and a test game.  The test game is basically a tutorial to
show you how you can build your MUD on Phantasmal.

To find out what version of Phantasmal and DGD you're getting, you can
check the VERSIONS file in the top directory, which is generally up to
date.  You can also check the startup messages to find out your DGD
version, and the logfile in log/System.log to find out your Phantasmal
version.  Those are both always up to date.

                     Installing Bundled Phantasmal

  After unpacking the distribution, run the "install_mud" script.  On
a Linux box, that should be as easy as going to the right directory
and typing "./install_mud.pl".  On a Windows box or a less-usual Unix
box, you might need to type "perl install_mud.pl" or "/usr/bin/perl
install_mud.pl".

  On a Linux box, you can run the MUD by typing "./start_mud.pl", or
the equivalent Perl alternatives above.
